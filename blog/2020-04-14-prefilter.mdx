title: Transaction Throughput Fix
date: 2020-04-16 14:30 -0800
---

We've been doing some internal work to increase transaction throughput from our API, and this has
required some Hotspot side support, with respect to how the consensus group prefilters incoming
transactions. The old code wasn't playing well with ordered transactions (multiple consecutive
payments, for example). Expect more related fixes in the next few releases.

This release also bumps the assumed valid block.
