As part of improving network behavior and testing it in a real environment we use a number of opt-in
beta hotspots.

<!--truncate-->

There are some ground rules for beta deployments that we strictly follow:

- The change can _not_ affect blockchain consensus behavior. Any behavior change that affects chain
  consensus rules _must_ be gated on a chain variable

- The change can improve peripheral elements of the software which _may_ indirectly affect the
  behavior of the blockchain. Changes are usually related to performance or stability improvements
  that make it more likely that a hotspot can talk to more hotspots or recover from error conditions
  better than before the update.

## Content

The beta group was updated with firmware `2019.10.18.1` which includes:

- Improving some error resilience in the network relay service
- Only blacklisting relays that are explicitly known to not be connected by the intermediate host
- Speed improvements in NAT detection
- Using more available peer targets when syncing the blockchain
- Fix ledger disagreement over ordering of each hotspot's geographic neighbor list

## Deployment Plan

Given the small set of patches this beta includes and the expected stabilizing effect on block sync
and PoC receipt delivery issues, we plan to let this beta run for 24 hours and then deploy it to the
network at large.
