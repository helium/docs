We rolled out the [Beta update](https://docs.helium.com/blog/2019/10/10/beta-deploy) over the
weekend and it appears to have helped some, but a number of issues were discovered that caused
unneeded network load, slowing down blocks and elections.

## Content

- An optimization was added to ignore transactions already in the honey badger buffer.

- Elections that failed were not being cleaned up. Now they are.

- A recent blockchain refactor was reverted because it was inappropriately dropping transactions.

- The transaction manager now dumps a transaction if it sees f+1 rejections from the consensus
  group.

- More informative logging messages added around transaction validation and speculative absorption.
  This will help diagnose lingering issues.

## Deployment Plan

The patches are directly related to a focused set of issues that should improve chain behavior. We
plan to let this beta run for 24 hours and then deploy it to the network at large.
