In preparation for release of the LongFi SDK we are testing the latest version of the LongFi
protocol on a select few San Francisco hotspots that are within radio range of each other.

<!--truncate-->

## Content

This newly selected beta group was updated with Hotspot firmware version `2019.10.23.0` which
includes:

- A new version of concentrate which is the reference implemnentation of LongFi that runs on all
  Helium hotspots
- A new version of miner that integrates with this new version of concentrate for Proof of Coverage.

## Deployment Plan

We plan to let this beta run overnight to see how Proof of Coverage is impacted then deploy it to
the network at large to use the LongFi protocol.
