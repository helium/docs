As more and more hotspots ship out, we are encountering some blockchain syncing problems. A number
of the shipped hotspots were assembled over a month ago but had older firmwware that did not include
some important bugfixes.

In some cases the older firmware absorbs blocks in their ledger that they don't properly understand
causing ledger corruption issues that prevent further syncing.

To mitigate this problem we have decided to deploy an intentionally backwards incompatible change to
the blockchain sync protocol. The goal here is two fold; to correct some deficiencies in the
original sync protocol and to force hotspots running an older firmware to upgrade before starting to
sync the chain.

In addition a small change to peerbook metadata has been made to allow hotspots to advertise the
last time they wrote a block to their local blockchain. This is intended to help spotting and
diagnosing hotspots experiencing syncing problems.

- Roll the blockcain sync protocol version

## Deployment Plan

As this is a network-wide breaking change we plan to roll it out as quickly a possible to everyone
to avoid partitioning the network. A small controlled smoke test OTA will be done followed shortly
by a release to general availability.
