On October 25 around 6 PM PDT we rolled out a
[GA release](https://docs.helium.com/blog/2019/20/25/beta-deploy-2) to address blockchain syncing
problems. This was a network-wide change that intentionally broke compatibility with the previous
1.0 version of the blockchain sync protocol.

While the change did not appear to effect any hotspots that were already fully synced with the
blockchain, several reports of stuck or backwards syncing hotspots began arriving the following
morning from customers who had just finished onboarding their newly unboxed hotspots.

## Content

The beta group was updated with Hotspot firmware version `2019.10.25.1-2-g64a37ee4` which includes:

- Add block height to assume valid block information
- Implement recursive locking for blockchain mutex
- Bump assume valid block to 98917 (2019.10.29.0 GA release only)

## Deployment Plan

We plan to let this beta overnight to give the targeted hotspots enough time to resync past the
assumed valid block from scratch. If resyncing succeeds we will tag the branch as `2019.10.29.0` and
confirm that the GA release OTA updates successfully before making it available to all hotspots.
