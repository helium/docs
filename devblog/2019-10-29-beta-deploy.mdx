In preparation for release of the LongFi SDK we are testing the latest version of the LongFi
protocol on a select few San Francisco hotspots that are within radio range of each other.

<!--truncate-->

## Content

This beta group was updated with Hotspot firmware version `2019.10.29.0-5-g8375a825`which includes:

- The latest 0.2.5 version of concentrate which is the reference implementation of LongFi that runs
  on all Helium hotspots
- A new version of miner that integrates with this new version of concentrate for Proof of Coverage
- An upgrade from CMake 3.8 to 3.11 so that the latest version of concentrate can be built

## Deployment Plan

We plan to let this beta run overnight to see how Proof of Coverage is impacted If the beta hotspots
are able to witness Proof of Coverage challenges we will tag the branch as `2019.10.30.0` and
confirm that the GA release OTA updates successfully before making it available to all hotspots.
