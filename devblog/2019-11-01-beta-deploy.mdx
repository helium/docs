On November 1 around 3 PM PDT we rolled out a new beta release to better distribute PoC requests
throughout the election cycle, and including some other longer-term engineering improvements.

## Block Weather

We're aware of the increasing block times and low PoC success rate and are working actively to
ameliorate them. They are largely a result of increasing hotspot density interacting poorly with our
soon-to-be-deprecated initial PoC path selection code.

We're working as quickly as possible on a new version of this code which should scale more cleanly
due to its use of radio data, rather than asserted location, for hotspot neighborhood graph
construction. If the new code to spread the work into more blocks isn't effective enough, we will
likely alter the PoC challenge interval from 30 to 60 to decrease the number of PoC receipts that we
have to process. Since the PoC rewards are proportional, rather than per-challenge, this should not,
in aggregate, effect challenge rewards once the challenges have redistributed themselves. We expect
challenge rewards to rise as we improve the distribution and make them less expensive to process.

## Content

- _Validation Timings_: We've added more log data so as to better understand which transaction
  validations are expensive, so that we can better optimize them.
- _PoC Request Randomization_: We've changed how we approach the randomization of when in the
  request cycle PoC requests are issued. This should do a better job of spreading them out and allow
  more of them to go through. This change also persists temporary receipt information so that fewer
  requests are lost to restarts.
- _Prorated Rewards_: Up to now, we have calculated all rewards on the basis of an idealized 30
  round election period. This is sometimes not the case. The code here prepares for the activation
  of a new chain variable which will switch us to a code path that changes all rewards to use the
  actual period (other than for consensus rewards, which will continue to use the ideal period to
  disincentiveize delaying the completion of elections). Expect another dev blog update when this
  variable is activated.
- _Chain Var Validation_: All chain vars are now fully validated when their transaction is absorbed.
  This is a safety measure to keep hotspots with stale firmware from absorbing blocks that have
  chain vars their firmware doesn't know about, which they cannot safely process.

## Deployment Plan

We plan to let this beta over the weekend, but may activate it before Monday if block times continue
to be poor.
