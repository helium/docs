We have released a firmware based on the previous beta to general availability. This firmware is
focused on improving Proof of Coverage construction and validation times. The main change from the
last beta has been to refactor our PoC path calculation routines to be more efficent and to improve
our caching of expensive to obtain information necessary for pathing. This change can be seen at
[blockchain-core#289](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/289) .

Other notable changes, mentioned in the previous beta post:

Blockchain:

- [blockchain-core#282](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/282)
- [blockchain-core#280](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/280)

Miner:

- [miner#240](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/240)

We are still working towards an overhaul of the proof of coverage system that should be fairer and
generate more achieveable paths, as well as be much cheaper to compute. That work is being tracked,
at least partially in [blockchain-core#257](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/257). In
the meantime this release should help improve the proportion of hotspots getting rewarded and
stabilize block times a little more.
