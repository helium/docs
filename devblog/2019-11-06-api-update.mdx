As part of updating the blockchain-api to support newer routes and squash some critical api bugs,
the team has pushed out a new release of the production blockchain-api.

## Content

The new release contains the following updates:

- Fix a google maps reverse api lookup crash, which would previously cause the whole application to
  shut down.
- Add hotspot name to `/api/accounts/<account_address>/gateways` route for easy cross-checking of
  account holder hotspots.
- Rounded off block sync percent to be in line with the current state of the hotspot.
- Enable `/api/hotspots/<address>/challenges` route which shows a list of poc challenges a hotspot
  has done so far.
- Enable `/api/hotspots/timeline` route to check newly added hotspots.
- Enable `/api/accounts/<account_addres>/rewards` route to check account rewards.
- Add support for `oui_v1` transaction posting and querying.
- Add support for `security_exchange_v1` transaction posting and querying.
