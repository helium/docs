On November 25 around 11:30 AM PDT we rolled out a new beta release.

<!--truncate-->

Hotspot owners have been reporting long blockchain sync times anywhere from 3 to 5 days after
onboarding. The assumed valid block was last bumped in hotspot firmware release `2019.11.08` to
106,300. As of 3:30 PM November 25 PDT the blockchain height is at 119,322. This means that when a
hotspot is done syncing 89% of the blockchain the rate at which it syncs the remaining 11% is much
slower. This `2019.11.25` release bumps the assumed valid block to 116,796.
