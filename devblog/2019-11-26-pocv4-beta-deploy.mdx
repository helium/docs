On November 26 around 9:40 PM PDT we rolled out a new beta release.

<!--truncate-->

This beta contains the new version of the proof of coverage implementation. A fuller explanation of
the changes will be delivered in a subsequent blog post but the essence of the changes are:

- Pathing is based on historical witnessing, not raw geography
- Hotspots will not be challenged until they themselves have synced and begun to challenge
- All hotspots will have the opportunity to be challenged
- Proof of Coverage paths are now much, much faster to compute and verify, which should lower block
  times and avoid dropping PoC receipts that are too slow to verify

In additon the assume valid block was updated to block 119,972.

## Deployment Plan

We plan to let this `2019.11.26` release beta overnight and deploy it to general availability
sometime Wednesday. We plan to activate the new code next Monday, December 2nd after the
Thanksgiving holiday in the US so we will have as many personnel as possible online to watch for
issues during the activation.
