On November 30, around 13:05 PST we forcefully selected a new consensus group since the previous
consensus group got wedged because of a bad update to the hotspots on the network.

## Content

In order to make progress on making blocks, the team chose a new consensus group via a
`blockchain_txn_consensus_group_v1` transaction.

These new members were chosen randomly based on their network score and ability to be connectable.

Transaction block height: 121439

Transaction:

```
type=group
height=121438
delay=0
members=["melted-ultraviolet-mole",
         "decent-lemonade-starling",
         "micro-clear-griffin",
         "mammoth-tartan-tortoise",
         "harsh-alabaster-mole",
         "magic-rainbow-wasp",
