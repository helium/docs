The prior update, shipped this morning, has had some unintented consequences. Because of a change in
an init script, a latent race condition in the configuration of the WiFi interface has caused some
Hotspots to be unable to connect to WiFi. Whether a Hotspot is affected depends on what firmware
version it was running when it was initially configured for WiFi. Hotspots on Ethernet should not be
affected.

<!--truncate-->

**If your Hotspot is showing 'needs attention' and has a greenish/yellow LED color, you are likely
affected.**

We have analyzed the problem and there are 2 known fixes:

- Re-configure the wifi credentials on the Hotspot
- Boot the previous firmware

To boot the previous firmware, use the following procedure:

- Unplug the power
- Press down the black pairing button on the side of the Hotspot
- Reconnect the power while holding down the black pairing button
- While holding down the button, wait for the status LED to light up, then wait an additional 10
  seconds
- Release the button

This will cause the Hotspot to boot the previous firmware where the race condition was far less
likely and the Hotspot will be able to use its configured Wifi credentials.

An OTA with a permanent fix is in testing and will be deployed once it is confirmed to work as
intended. We apologize for the inconvienience.
