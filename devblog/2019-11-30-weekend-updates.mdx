On November 30, around 10:30 PST we will be rolling out a new beta release.

<!--truncate-->

This beta contains only 2 changes, one to fix a problem introduced by an earlier release that turned
out to have some performance impacts and one fix for a long-standing problem where a node would
generate an invalid PoC receipt and thus fail to submit the results of its challenge.

## Content

- [libp2p - make peerbook metadata asynchronous](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/231)
- [blockchain-core - snapshot ledger after block is committed](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/300)

No assume-valid adjustments were made.

## Deployment Plan

Due to the performance impacts, we will probably fast track this beta to GA if the deployment to the
beta group looks good.
