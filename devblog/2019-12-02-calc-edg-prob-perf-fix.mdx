Upon activating PoC v4 at 1:50 PM PST on December 2nd we soon realized that the `calc_edge_prob` had
become a performance bottleneck. In response, we changed the order of operations and switched from
using `sets` to `lists` so the calculation is less costly.

The changes are encapsulated in
[blockchain-core#303](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/303).

The beta deploy was done around 5:10 PM PST and will be deployed to GA shortly.
