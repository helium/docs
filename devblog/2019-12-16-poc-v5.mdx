The launch and activation of PoC v4 introduced some interesting new paths and brought in much needed
performance improvements. We have essentially quadrupled the number of challenges on the network as
validation of PoC receipts is now significantly more efficient.

<!--truncate-->

Since the activation of PoC v4 the community has been consistently providing feedback to make PoC
challenges more random and fair. The new firmware `2019.12.16.0` attempts to address some of these
issues. We also upgraded Erlang `rocksdb` to an upstream `1.1.0` version and bumped the assumed
valid block to `138655`.

## Content

With this update we attempt to solve:

- [blockchain-core#314. Filteration for witnesses which are considered invalid](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/314).

Since each Hotspot maintains a histogram of the witnesses with the corresponding RSSI of witnessed
packets, we can use the free space path loss formula to determine whether it's _impossible_ for two
hotspots to have witnessed each other at those RSSI values. We will now filter these values out.

Secondly, we check whether the witness being considered for a potential next hop is actually an
active Hotspot or not. If the Hotspot has not issued a challenge in the last 300 blocks it is
considered inactive.

And finally, we added support for a chain variable for making the initial target selection more
random. A breakdown of chain variables is described below.

- [blockchain-core#314. Scoring fixes for verifiably impossible RSSI values](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/314).

We believe that witnesses which are too close to a challenged Hotspot should not gain any score, as
these witnesses are often located in the same room or building as the Hotspot being challenged and
not adding significant value to the network.

We also now ensure that RSSI values look reasonable and have added a check that the _impossible_
RSSI values don't dominate the overall RSSI values.

- [blockchain-core#313. Cache improvements to speed up cold miner start](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/313).

Since we can't do a snapshot without committing, we do the next best thing and save the context
state between old ledger height calls to the same height.

- [blockchain-core#317. Fix potential ledger snapshot inconsistencies](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/317).

The ledger has two modes "active" and "delayed". We ensure snapshots can only be taken from an
"active" ledger.

Furthermore, when restoring a context cache we make sure the ledger is in delayed mode to prevent
the context being installed onto the wrong subledger.

- [blockchain-core#310. Float normalization all around](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/310).

Floats are a necessarily evil and may cause a potential latent drift in the ledger view. Therefore
we have normalized all the necessary floats introduced with PoC v4 and PoC v5.

- [miner#265. Miner updates to support and test POC V5](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/265).

We've added three comprehensive test suites to the miner to check for the above PoC v5 changes.

We've also improved how we assess PoC witness quality from blockchain-core so the API can do the
same.

- [blockchain-core#322. Export witness quality checks from core](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/322)

This builds on top of core#314 and ensures that verifiably inconsistent witnesses don't get
rewarded. We've added filters to check for two potential discrepancies:

1. Check that the witness is sufficiently far from the Hotspot it witnessed. We believe this would
   discourage installing multiple Hotspots in vicinity and attempting to game the reward system.

2. Since we collect the RSSI data in the ledger, we've also added a check for
   [Free Space Path Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss) for witness to
   challengee RSSI values.

- [miner#270. Add support and tests for witness quality checks](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/270)

This is to ensure that we correctly check the blockchain-core behavior in miner.

## Deployment Plan

We ran the beta overnight on Monday the 16th and marked it GA on Tuesday the 17th at 12 PM PST.
