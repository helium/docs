The
[PoC v5 update](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2019/12/17/poc-v5.html)
exposed a few edge cases in [blockchain-core](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core) related to
Uber's [H3](https://github.com/uber/h3) library. The `grid_distance` function in H3 can crash in the
following scenarios:

<!--truncate-->

- Pentagonal distortion
- Mismatched h3 resolutions
- Hotspots being too far away with no possible `grid_distance` existing between them

## Content

[blockchain-core#325](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/325) addresses the above
crashes. This fix attempts to calculate the distance and fails gracefully if any of the above
scenarios occur.

## Deployment Plan

On December 18 around 10:20 AM PDT we rolled out a `2019.12.18.0` beta release with a hotfix for
these issues. We plan to let this beta run for 1 hour then deploy it to the network at large.
