With the launch and activation of PoC v5, the team quickly realized that we needed to bring back
some of the PoC RSSI related probability weights back to the path construction algorithm to allow
building paths with potentially known valid witnesses as next hops.

Note that the targeting mechanism is still deterministically random to avoid the high scoring
feedback loops we observed with PoC V4.

## Content

We've updated the following chain vars:

| Var                  | Existing | Proposed | Rationale                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| poc_v4_prob_rssi_wt  | 0.0      | 0.2      | Re-introduced to bias for selecting next hop witnesses which have proven good RSSI values when constructing poc path |
| poc_v4_prob_time_wt  | 0.0      | 0.2      | Re-introduced to bias for selecting next hop witnesses which are not stale when constructing poc path                |
| poc_v4_prob_count_wt | 0.0      | 0.2      | Re-introduced to bias for selecting next hop witnesses which have been rarely seen when constructing poc path        |
| poc_v4_randomness_wt | 1.0      | 0.4      | Reduce bias for selecting next hop witness entirely randomly                                                         |

The audit log can be found [here](https://github.com/helium/miner/blob/master/audit/var-12.md).

## Deployment Plan

The chain var was activated in block 140720.
