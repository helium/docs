Over time we have seen our gossip quality degrade as the network has become larger. Over the
holidays, we experienced multiple blockchain stalls. Some of these stalls were the result of
out-of-memory errors. This `2020.01.05.0` release adds an ARP mechanism to libp2p to pro-actively
refresh stale peer book entries. In addition, we fixed a couple of unfortunate typos in PoC receipt
validation. We also bumped the assumed valid block to 163,853 for faster resync times.

before making it available to all hotspots.
