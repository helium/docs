With this update we hope to alleviate some of the known concerns regarding POC path construction
while also fixing some overlooked typos.

## Content

We've updated the following chain vars:

| Var            | Old       | New  | Rationale                                                                |
| -------------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| poc_version    | 5         | 6    | Update poc version to disallow pathing with known impossible RSSI values |
| poc_typo_fixes | undefined | true | Introduce this chain var to trigger POC receipt validation typo fixes    |

We have updated the `poc_version` to `6` which triggers filtering witnesses eligible for a potential
next hop when constructing a path to have reasonable RSSI values. We track known RSSI values as a
histogram in the ledger for each hotspot and can veriafiably prove that a hotspot A has witnessed
another hotspot B with an _impossible_ RSSI value in accordance with the Free Space Path Loss.

- [blockchain-core#328. Fix two typos in POC receipt validation](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/328).

Prior to the typo fixes we were mistakenly dropping about 1/3rd of POC receipts when doing
validation. We expect the number of POC receipts to go significantly up with this change. However,
to not break consensus rules we have masked this change behind `poc_typo_fixes` chain var and have
activated it to be `true`.
