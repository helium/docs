We've been seeing issues of ledger corruption when nodes are syncing the chain with increased
frequency and have finally identified the fix. In the way we use rocksdb we split data in the ledger
and the blockchain across column families (eg token balances are distinct from hotspot information).
The ledger corruption issues were when _part_ of a ledger update would commit but the other parts
would not. The fix was to enable the
[atomic flush](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Atomic-flush) option in the rocksdb database
options which ensures that all updates in a batch update are committed atomically, even across
column families.

Additionally we added a small optimization to block validation for bypassing validation for a block
the node is a signatory of. This helps the consensus group move to a new round faster, especially
when the block is large or slow to validate. Since the signer has already validated the block before
it signed it, validating it again is redundant.

## Deployment Plan

We plan to beta `2020.01.08.0` for a couple of hours starting around 7:00 PM PDT and confirm that
the GA release OTA downgrades successfully before making it available to all hotspots.
