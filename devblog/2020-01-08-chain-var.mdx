## Plan

Shortly, we are going to issue a chain variable which will increase the Proof of Coverage (PoC)
interval from 30 blocks to 60 blocks. This will have the effect of reducing the rate of PoC requests
sharply, which should decrease long blocks going forward.

Note that this may increase the number of low-reward epochs for some users, but it should average
out to the same rate of rewards in the longer run.

## Rationale

We initially picked the PoC interval of 30 blocks essentially because it was similar to our election
interval of 30 blocks. It meant that most Hotspots would challenge each election period. However,
validating PoC receipts remains challenging and computationally expensive. While this is something
that we're working to ameliorate (see PR
[core/318](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/318)), it doesn't really get to the core
of the issue, which is that we are only beginning to understand the _quality_ of the results from
the PoC system. It's quite likely that even an interval of 60 is still far too often than is needed
for good quality results, and since the PoC system represents (necessary) overhead on the
functioning of the rest of the system, we hope to engage it as seldom as is possible while still
getting good results. As such, we intend to spend more time in the near future attempting to
understand system quality and to develop a metric that will allow us to understand how things like
the challenge interval affect the quality of the results that the PoC system delivers. Our PoC
system is quite novel, and we often make mistakes in its implementation. We appreciate your patience
as we work towards making this system deliver high-quality results for all of our stakeholders.

Watch this space for more on the quality metric and potential future changes to the challenge
interval in the future.
