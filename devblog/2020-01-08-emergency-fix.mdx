A number of assert location transactions had become stalled and were replayed from the API.
Unfortunately they all landed in the same few blocks, which became nearly impossible to process
quickly because of some index book-keeping overhead that must be done when gateways are asserted.
This release disabled some of that book-keeping, which is obsolete, and optimized other cases where
the expensive work doesn't need to be done. This should allow all of the stalled Hotspots (around 5%
of the fleet) to resume syncing and challenging.
