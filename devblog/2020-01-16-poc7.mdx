### Block Weather

As you may have noticed, block times recently have regularly not been meeting their typical sixty
second deadline with any regularity. You can read more about how we deal with slow block times and
long elections
[here](https://developer.helium.com/blockchain/mining-token-rewards#hnt-proration-and-slow-block-times).

In a [recent post](https://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/01/08/chain-var.html), we discussed a reduction
in the rate of Proof of Coverage (PoC) challenges. While this seemed to briefly be effective, we
quickly found ourselves back where we started with the growth of the network. While slowing the rate
of challenge did have the intended effect, soon after we fixed a number of bugs and reissued a large
number of location assertion transactions that had gotten lost, making the network even larger, and
taking back most of the ground we had gained. While we were observing these changes, we have been
working on a feature called
[hierarchical targeting](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/318). This pull requests and
other related requests changes how the _initial target_ of a PoC challenge. The initial target is
the first step of a PoC challenge path. Previously, this Hotspot was selected from the entire list
of hotspots. Somewhat obviously, this scales poorly as the network grows (recall, that while there
are only a few thousand Hotspots at this point, they're all running on relatively under-powered
hardware). This code uses a new index that is built and maintained on disk of Hotspots that are
relatively nearby each other (in [H3](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) terms, they all share the same
parent hex at resolution 5).

### Contents

- _Hierarchical Targeting_: Don't pull all Hotspots for every target selection and receipt
  validation. PRs [core/318](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/318),
  [miner/287](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/287)
- _Reduce Memory Usage_: Another issue that we've been running into is Hotspot miners running out of
  memory and getting restarted by the linux OOM killer. These PRs start our efforts to make this
  happen less often: [miner/286](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/286),
  [libp2p/242](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/242),
  [libp2p/243](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/243),
  [libp2p/244](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/244)

### Plan

We'll beta this release overnight, then GA in the morning on Friday, Jan 17. Once we're satsfied
that things are stable, we'll commit a chain variable transaction setting
`poc_target_hex_parent_res` to 5 and `poc_version` to 7.
