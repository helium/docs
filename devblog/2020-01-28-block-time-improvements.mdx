### Block Weather

While the out of memory improvements from yesterday have helped, the erratic block times have
returned. We believe this has to do with the gossip network topolology degrading over time (an OTA
resets the gossip network connections as the nodes reboot). We have identified some more fixes that
should help block propogation times between the consensus group which should limit the impact of bad
gossip topologies on the block production rate.
