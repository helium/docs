### Block Weather

Despite our prior efforts, we have still been tracking (and debugging) high memory usage in our
storage engine, RocksDB. We have identified some additional fixes and this issue has become critical
as of block `186592`. This block was somewhat large and has triggered Out of Memory kills on much of
the network as it propogates out. This release contains improvements that should allow the network
to absorb past that block.

Additionally this release bumps the assume-valid block to `186622`.
