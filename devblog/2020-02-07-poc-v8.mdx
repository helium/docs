### Summary

We have been steadily gathering data on the performance of Proof-of-Coverage and are ready to
release the PoC version 8 update. This update brings a few key bug fixes and enhancements detailed
below.

### Contents

- **Target filtering**: With the introduction of hierarchical targeting we stopped checking whether
  the target Hotspot is actually eligible to be a target. This was largely done for performance
  improvements, however, we are re-introducing target filtering with PoC v8. We believe we have
  mitigated the performance drawbacks by limiting the target search space addressed in PoC v7. We
  _know_ that there are Hotspots on the network which are not participating in any poc/reward
  activity for a variety reasons (offline, etc), and there is no reason to attempt to target or path
  through them.

- **Witness RSSI centrality metrics**: As the network grows we have gathered enough data to make
  more conscientious decisions around which Hotspots to include to when creating PoC paths. In order
  to do this we split the witness histogram into two buckets, one being a "good" bucket the other
  being "bad". The probability of picking a witness as a next hop in the path is now governed by the
  ratio of good vs bad counts. We believe this to be a better approach rather than simply declaring
  a witness as bad by looking at RSSI values. The fact that RSSI alone is not a good enough metric
  to make such decisions hinders better paths, and as a result we plan on adding additional witness
  data collection to make better decisions going forward.

- **Address next hop randomness bug**: Thanks to the community we identified a bug in the next hop
  selection algorithm where the random seed for target selection would conflict with the seed for
  the _first_ subsequent hop when creating a path. We've addressed this bug by generating a random
  seed **once** for targeting, and propogating that through the target/pathing algorithm.

- **Fix extremely long next hops**: We've introduced a new chain variable `poc_max_hop_cells` which
  would limit how far away a potential next hop can be. It is defined in terms of h3 grid cells.

- **Ensure new consensus members have latest block**: We've added code to prevent slow block gossip
  holding up a new election round by trying to fast-forward all the new consensus group members to
  the same block.

- **Bump assumed valid block**: We've also bumped the assumed valid block to 196777.

- **Adjust some peerbook gossip rules**: We're trying some changes to peerbook gossip to try to keep
  peers fresher.

### Plan

We've been betaing this release since Saturday morning and plan to release it go General
Availibility this evening. We will then activate PoCv8 sometime Monday morning.
