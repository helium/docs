### Summary

We continue to receive excellent feedback from the community regarding some of the decisions we made
with the introduction of PoC V8. This update clarifies the new chain variable transaction we issued
on Thu 13 Feb 2020 09:29:39 PM UTC.

### Concerns

- **Consensus group membership not geographically diverse**: In order to ensure that the consensus
  members are geographically diverse, we have reduced the `election_cluster_res` from `8` to `4`.

- **Lower bucket for good RSSI values too strict**: In order to allow witnesses seen at RSSI values
  below our initial expectation to be considered good enough for constructing paths, we have reduced
  the lower threshold `poc_good_bucket_low` from `-115` to `-118`. Note that since this is a
  logarthmic scale, we believe that any RSSI below -118 is likely too low to be considered good
  enough.
