### Summary

In a previous release, we attempted to resolve some rare issues with consensus members forgetting
they're in the consensus group. Unfortunately this traded a rare consensus member failure for a rare
crash loop. This issue led to the long block over the weekend and we've been testing a fix for the
last couple days.

Additionally it was observed that nodes with clock skew behind the block time would refuse to sync.
This has also been corrected and validarted to unstick such nodes.

Additionally we've landed a bugfix for a rare division by 0 during PoC packet construction and
bumped the assume-valid block to 211438.
