### Notes

- **Console 'api/v1' Endpoint**: a new endpoint and the ability to generate keys that don't expire
  has been added to Console. The endpoints have been rate limited in the following way:

  - a single user can create a maximum of 10k labels and devices
  - the API is rate limited to 100 calls per second

- **API Keys stored in Plain Text**: currently, when the user types in their API keys, it is stored
  in the directory of the executable in plain text.
