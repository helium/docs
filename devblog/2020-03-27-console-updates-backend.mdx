### Summary

We made recent updates to Console that included backend changes and apologize if the update may have
caused any disruption for existing users.

<!--truncate-->

Although Console is still in beta, going forward weâ€™ll inform the community of relevant updates
before deployment.

### Contents

Backend changes/fixes:

- Identical payloads sent from multiple Hotspots, within a one second window, will be aggregated so
  only a single payload will be pushed to integrations.
- Updated the payload schema (included list of Hotspots, labels).
- Fixed fields in payload (frame_up/down, fcnt, and timestamp).

Integrations:

- Added myDevices Cayenne and AWS IoT integrations.
