The new API has been deployed to api.helium.wtf (development) and api.helium.io (prod) for a couple
of weeks now and as part of moving the mobile application to it we realized that two routes were not
quite consistent.

<!--truncate-->

`/v1/blocks/:height` and `/v1/blocks/hash/:hash` currently return a paged response that includes
both the high level block details _and_ a paged list of transactions.

In order to make paging more consistent and not return duplicate information, we're going to:

1. Add new routes `/v1/blocks/:height/transactions` and `/v1/blocks/hash/:hash/transactions` to get
   a paged list of transactions for a block at a given height or hash, respectively.

2. Remove the _transactions_ field from the result of `/v1/blocks/:height` and
   `/v1/blocks/hash/:hash`.

This will require a change from code using the API to retrieve transactions, but should make API
usage more consistent.

### Deployment

This API change is ready in a [pull request](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http/pull/42) and
will be merged and deployed to api.helium.wtf and api.helium.io on April 7.
