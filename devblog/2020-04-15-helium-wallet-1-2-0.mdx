We just pushed a new `1.2.0` release of the
[helium-wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs).

<!--truncate-->

- Moves `-f` and `--file` to _before_ the command. The wallet file option is considered a global
  option which needs to precede the command.

- Adds a new global option `--format` which specifies the output format of a given command. The
  supported output formats are:

  - `table` (default) - The existing visual table output
  - `json` - A json form of the output of the command

  The `json` form is handy for scripts wrapping the wallet commands

- Removes the `--hash` option for the `pay` command since the `--format json` output gives the
  equivalent information and more

- Removes the short version of the `--hashlock` and `--timelock` options to the `htlc` command since
  they conflicted with global options.

The binary release of the cli is available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/releases/tag/v1.2.0).
