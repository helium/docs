### Summary

We identified a flaw where we did not check for 0 amount transactions in some cases. While largely
harmless, it can lead to transaction spam. Additionally, after doing some load testing, we've
lowered the maximum block size (measured in number of transactions) while we continue to work on
improving block propogation times.

### Audit
