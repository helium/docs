Hello Helium Community!

In this update, we fixed a few bugs and added more information to diagnostic reports, and show your
location when viewing the Hotspot Network Map.

#### Bugs

Show how many Hotspots are offline

- In Hotspot list view, we were incorrectly showing how many Hotspots were offline. This is now
  fixed.

Fixed an i18n issue where a different language and locale caused the app to crash (iOS only).

#### Features

Diagnostic Reports now include IP Address to further help troubleshoot issues.

When viewing the Hotspot Networ Map, we show your location so you can see the Hotspots around you.
