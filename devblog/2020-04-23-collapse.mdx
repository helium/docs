### Block Weather

While yesterdays fix for block times
([see here](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/04/22/various-times.html))
went well, a seemingly unrelated change has caused quite a bit of trouble today.

<!--truncate-->

[This PR](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/267) simplified our P2P relay system quite a
lot and should allow us to get better performance for less memory. However, the `random` routine in
our peerbook (which the PR uses heavily) does not filter for stale peer entries (which contain the
actual IP addresses to open a network connection to). So, after 24h (the global staleness deadline)
a large number of peers become un-dialable via the address which `random` returns. For various
reasons, dials are done via a string representing the peer, rather than the peer entry itself. When
`random` would return a stale peer, the dial would not be able to find that peer because its entry
was stale and the downstream code was correctly filtering for stale peers. 24 hours after
yesterday's release, which caused all Hotspots to reboot and update their peer entries, this was
affecting around 12% of all peers which returned from `random`.

This issue by itself was not a horrible problem. Mostly things would retry in this situation. But
our gossip server does not appear to handle this situation correctly, and when a gossip worker dies
due to the above misdial, it never seems to notice, so eventually the node cannot establish any
gossip connections and the gossip network collapses like we have seen today.
[You can read this post](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/03/31/sync-fix.html)
for more context.

This release adds filtering both for the relay and for the peerbook `random` function, so now we
favor newly updated random peers and never return a stale peer from the random function. We've also
found and fixed the tracking of gossip workers, so if they crash their replacement is correctly
tracked and used for sending gossip messages. In addition, it bumps the assumed valid block. The
speed-ups for hbbft mentioned
[here](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/04/22/various-times.html)
will land in a release early next week.
