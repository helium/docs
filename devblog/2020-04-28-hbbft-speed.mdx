### Block Weather

[Recently](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/04/23/collapse.html), we
mentioned that we had some pending speedups to our HBBFT implementation. This image releases them to
the cluster.

<!--truncate-->

These changes mostly speed up HBBFT by eliminating duplicate work. Our threshold decryption library,
used (albeit indirectly) to anonymize transaction proposals, now retains its verification state in
between operations, which both makes it faster to use and harder to misuse. Additionally, the local
node was not giving its own inputs any special treatment, despite the fact that it knew them
already, so now it retains the pre-verified and decrypted shares for the combination phase of the
protocol. There have been a few other changes to guarantee that we're duplicating as little work as
possible.

Additionally, this release contains:

- Currently disabled code for resetting witnesses over time, which will be activated later.
- Relaxed Proof of Coverage receipt timeouts, so we will wait longer for a delayed request.
