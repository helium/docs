We just pushed a `1.2.2` patch release of the
[helium-wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs).

<!--truncate-->

- Fixes the `-f` and `--file` option to take filenames correctly instead of only showing usage.

  For example:

  ```
  heliium-wallet -f my_wallet.key info
  ```

  and for sharded wallets:

  ```
  helium-wallet -f w.key.1m -f w.key.2 -f w.key.3 info
  ```

The binary release of the cli is available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/releases/tag/v1.2.2).
