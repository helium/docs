On Tuesday, May 12th, we plan to start a network upgrade both to the blockchain and the LoRaWAN
compliant infrastructure at 8 am PDT / 11 am ET. The operation is expected to be complete no later
than 8:59 am PDT / 11:59 am ET. Progress will be reported live [here](http://status.helium.com/).

The upgrade focuses on many infrastructure improvements which are designed to help the network scale
and continue to decentralize as adoption continues to grow. We consider that upgrades with potential
disruptions should be infrequent and avoided whenever possible, but as our adaptation of LoRaWAN to
a decentralized model for network infrastructure has matured, such an upgrade is necessary at this
time.

In addition, be aware that there is only the _potential_ for disruption and, in fact, many devices
with resilient LoRaWAN implementations should experience minimal interruption. That being said, the
reality is that resilience is often at odds with simplicity, and as such, many LoRaWAN
implementations have opted for simplicity and may not navigate the upcoming changes without
intervention.

The upcoming updates include the following:

- A blockchain transaction for registering LoRaWAN identifiers (ie: AppEui, DevEui pairs) to the
  blockchain; Organizational Unique Identifiers (OUIs) all maintain their own table of these which
  allow Miners to know that the OUIs LoRaWAN Network Server (or “Router”) is interested in
  JoinRequests from these devices. **This effectively enables permissionless registering of devices
  to the network.**
- A blockchain transaction for reserving a subnet, ie: bits in the DevAddr space; after the Join, a
  Router may allocate any of its reserved subnet space to any of its devices. **This permits the
  co-location of many devices on the same public network despite having disparate private network
  servers.**
- Switching to subband 2; We've made the decision to adopt subband 2 (switching from subband 7, our
  current selection). As we’ve on-boarded various existing LoRaWAN devices and gateways to the
  network, it’s become apparent that standardizing on subband 2 will increase usage and reduce
  onboarding friction. And though there is some traffic on this subband already, we have determined
  that it's minimal and shouldn't pose a problem for our Network users. **By reducing friction, we
  increase adoption of the network, which in turn drives Data Credit usage and thus the
  incentivization for Hotspot operators.**

There are several potential disruptions resulting from these changes:

- Due to the new DevAddr scheme, existing sessions will expire and devices will need to Join again.
  Many LoRaWAN stacks detect network presence with occasional ADR commands or ConfirmedUplinks and
  will Join again on their own. However, if your device stack does not have such logic -
  specifically if it's not configured to join on all potential subbands - a manual resetting to
  trigger a new Join may be necessary allowing for a DevAddr to be assigned that is compliant with
  the new scheme
- Due to the subband switch, devices will need to issue Joins on subband 2 rather than 7 to Join the
  Helium Network. In theory, LoRaWAN-compliant devices should attempt to Join on many subbands. In
  our experience, however, many LoRaWAN stacks are pre-configured for a subband and only attempt to
  Join on said subband. If this is the case, you will need to reconfigure the subband or update the
  LoRaWAN stack so it attempts to Join on other subbands than the preconfigured subband. In both
  cases, manual intervention may be required.
