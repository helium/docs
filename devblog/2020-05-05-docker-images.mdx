This release adds support for amd64 and arm64 Docker images containing miner. These images can be
fetched from Helium's image registry at quay.io. They are Alpine Linux-based so specify /bin/ash as
the interactive terminal. The amd64 images will run in the cloud and the arm64 images will run on a
Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 that has Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64-bit installed.

This release also bumps the assumed valid block up to `320747`.
