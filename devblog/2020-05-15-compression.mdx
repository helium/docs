Some common feedback we get is that Hotspots use too much bandwidth. We've taken some steps to
address this in the past, and today is the latest step in scaling bandwidth back. This release
applies compression to all connections between Hotspots and their other gossip peers, and makes it
easier to shift to more effective compression in the future. For non-Hotspot peers, this code is
backwards compatible, but you'll need to upgrade to see the benefits.
