Over the weekend we've identified a few minor issues with ledger snapshots, and since they're
impacting block times, we're issuing a minor release to clear them up. Our old code assumed that all
Hotspots would have all of the blocks, and there are a few bits of code that rely on that, one of
which affects consensus nodes, which has been negatively affecting block times.
