This release lands support for the HNT/USD price oracle. The code will be inactive until activated
via chain variable transaction, which we expect to do Friday afternoon or Monday.

<!--truncate-->

In addition to this, we've also landed several smaller fixes and improvements, largely to snapshots.
We've also upgraded our libsodium library which has led to a backwards incompatible change to
encrypted streams. This means that during the upgrade the consensus group will not be able to
operate in mixed mode, all the nodes will need to be upgraded to resume block production.
