As we gear up for expanding the Helium network to other regions we've been threading region
awareness through our code. As of this release the Helium Network will support hotspots in the EU868
region as well as the currently supported US915 region.

Additionally we've identified an issue that leads to Hotspots being unable to sync a snapshot over a
low bandwidth or high latency link. We've improved the situation somewhat and will work on
delivering a more comprehensive fix next week.
