This minor release increases some network timeouts again to compensate for snapshot sizes. It also
corrects an error in the "bad GPS fix" reporting code and makes snapshots more compatible with the
upcoming changes for data credits and transaction fees. Finally there's a small fix that may help
with some cases of ledger corruption. A bigger fix on this front is in the works.
