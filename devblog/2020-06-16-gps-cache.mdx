In an attempt to improve block times, we have developed a new Hotspot cache which keeps the
deserialized spots in memory for longer, so we're not constantly fetching and refetching the same
information from the disk. There's also a change make validation of Proof of Coverage(PoC) receipts
substantially cheaper.

Together these changes should make it easier validate incoming blocks and block times should
improve. Also stemming from this performance investigation, we anticipate lowering the maximum PoC
path length via chain variable transaction in order to reduce the cost of validating length six and
seven PoC paths, which are currently rarely successful.
