We've identified some more failures that have been leading to long block times and included fixes
for them in this release. In addition, now we have the price oracle running, we've landed the code
for real transaction fees and staking fees. These fees won't be active until we've made sure all the
wallets have been updated and everyone has had appropriate warning. Finally we've bumped the blessed
snapshot to 376561.
