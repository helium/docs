After monitoring the chain overnight and seeing few signs of recovery, further investigation
revealed that we were still seeing out of memory errors on v1 Hotspots. A closer reading of the docs
revealed that a part of the Erlang runtime reports memory usage in machine words (the width of the
processor's registers), which means that the earlier measurements we based our tunings on were too
low by a factor of 8. This release does nothing but retune the cache to use much less memory, which
we hope will stabilize the chain, if not fully restore block times.

<!--truncate-->

Current block time troubles are largely related to the slowness of the disk on the Hotspots combined
with certain problematic behaviors, mostly excessive clustering, engaged in by some users. We have
work in train to ameliorate the worst effects of these behaviors, but this will require a new chain
var, and so can't be rushed. Our in-progress Proof of Coverage redesign will include disincentives
for this sort of behavior as well.
