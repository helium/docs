While we are aware of some Hotspots falling out of sync (although they will eventually recover) we
have not yet isolated the root cause. This release only makes 2 changes, it fixes a problem with the
timing of LoRaWAN packets, specifically around meeting the downlink window and it blesses a new
snapshot at height 379441. The new snapshot should help unstick some Hotspots that are struggling,
and we will continue to work on a more permanent fix.
