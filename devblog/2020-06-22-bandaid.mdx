Recently it's come to our attention that a growing number of Hotspots are having issues staying in
sync with the chain. Hotspots use RocksDB as their storage layer for the ledger and the blockchain.
RocksDB offers a feature called snapshots which purports to provide an immutable, read-only version
of your store, in this case, old ledgers to make validation cheaper. Unfortunately, due to an
as-yet-unidentified issue, either to do with RocksDB itself, how the RocksDB Erlang NIF library is
written, or how our code is creating and using these snapshots, we're seeing some writes which have
been synchronously written to disk missing from the snapshots.

While we look into this, we're releasing this image, which will make affected Hotspots fall back
onto a less efficient path when they run into a validation error. The less efficient path is not
affected by this issue, and syncing should continue.
