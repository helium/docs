Much of the trouble that we've been having lately with maintaining consistent block times has been a
result of Hotspot clusters, some of them quite large. These clusters, often hosted in the same
place, lead to an abnormally high number of witnesses and a large disk representation. Since they're
colocated and witness each other, our Proof of Coverage (PoC) pathing code has some pathological
behavior when they're challenged, since it must consider sometimes hundreds of Hotspots to generate
the path. This can lead to single transactions that take the Hotspot hardware multiple seconds to
validate, which can cause a lot of problems for protocol completion and steady block times as the
validation and the Honeybadger runners compete for the disk.

<!--truncate-->

This release introduces a new chain variable that will allow us to restrict the number of Hotspots
that will be considered per target and pathing transaction step. This should more tightly bound the
amount of time that a single transaction can take and should make block times more predictable. This
new chain variable will cause applications using our `blockchain-core` library to halt when it is
activated sometime next week, so please, if you're running something that uses core, upgrade to or
past the `2020.06.24.0` tag by Tuesday June 30.
