For those of your running
[a Miner image for Docker](https://quay.io/repository/team-helium/miner?tab=tags), there has been a
change as of `miner-XXX64_2020.07.02.0_GA` to make regional support easier to configure.

<!--truncate-->

Previously, regional configuration required changes to the `sys.config` file, but now it can be done
by environmental variable, making it much easier to maintain or remove the override. The previous
workaround no longer works.

When using the `docker run` command, you will want to now use the `--env` option to set
`REGION_OVERRIDE` to the appropriate region, which would be one of the following:

```
US915 | EU868 | EU433 | CN470 | CN779 | AU915 | AS923 | KR920 | IN865
```

For example, `--env REGION_OVERRIDE=US915` tells your miner that you are connecting to a packet
forwarder configured for the US915 region.

Simply updating the docker image will reset the sys.config to a working default and if you were
using the previous `sys.config` copying workaround, please do not do so unless you have other
reasons to.

Keep in mind as we work towards allowing the adding and assertion of third-party gateways on the
Helium blockchain, this override will no longer be necessary for location-asserted miners and that
fully synced as the miner will derive the region from the blockchain.

These changes have also been documented
[here](https://developer.helium.com/blockchain/run-your-own-miner#start-container).
