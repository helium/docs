This `2020.07.09.0` release fixes longstanding bugs in gateway-config that resulted in incorrect
WiFi network states being reported to the mobile app and via the Hotspot's LED.

This release also updates the onboard blessed snapshot to block height `407521`. This allows newly
onboarded Helium Hotspots to sync the whole blockchain in hours not days.
