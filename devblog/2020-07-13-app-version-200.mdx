## Removal of GPS Status

In our last release `1.9.0`, we introduced and experimental feature on a Hotspot's GPS status that
was meant to be informational.

<!--truncate-->

It was clear to us that GPS was not a useful metric to validate Hotspot coverage as satellite
positions change, clouds get in the way, or if a tree happened to sway in the wind.

Because of this, we are removing the GPS information and will not depend on it to determine a
Hotspot's ability to earn HNT.

Some other updates:

- We've updated the API used under the hood.
- You may notice Hotspot Activity loading take a bit longer. We've changed how that information is
  loaded so that the rest of the app is speedier, and swiping between Hotspots is less buggy.
- Wallet now supports sending payments using `payments_v2` transaction types.
- Fixed a crash when viewing a `Confirm Location` transaction on the accounts page

### Known Issues

Switching Wi-Fi networks doesn't work if both Wi-Fi networks are found in the scan list.

- If you need to update your Wi-Fi credentials and both old and new networks appear in the scan
  list, contact support@helium.com and we can help manually update it for you.
