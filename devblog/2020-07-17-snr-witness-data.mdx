This `2020.07.16.0` release adds a chain variable for radio data gathering to aid with improvements
to proof-of-coverage. When the chain variable is activated the witness data collected will include
signal-to-noise ratio and frequency fields.

This release also bumps the onboard blessed snapshot to block height `417601`.
