This `2020.07.29.0` release fixes a bug in miner that resulted in numerous downlink LoRa packets
being dropped.

<!--truncate-->

In addition, this release upgrades the Linux image on the Helium Hotspot to Buildroot 2020.02.1.
This LTS release of Buildroot includes various security fixes and allowed us to upgrade the onboard
Erlang/OTP installation to 22.3.1.

Lastly, this release also bumps the onboard blessed snapshot to block height `435601`.
