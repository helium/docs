This `2020.07.31.0` release fixes an issue in libp2p which prevented some hotspots from being able
to reach the router when they didn't have router in their peerbook.

<!--truncate-->

We have updated `erlang-libp2p` and introduced a `miner` configuration option named `node_aliases`
to allow hotspots to connect to the router despite them not having it in their peerbook.

### Contents

- _Use aliases to shortcut p2p lookups_: PR:
  - [erlang-libp2p/294](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/294)

### Plan

We will beta `2020.07.31.0` around 2:50 PM PDT Friday July 31 and monitor the router and beta
hotspots closely. If testing goes as planned we will GA shortly afterwards by 3:30 PM PDT.
