- A fix has been pushed to address issue with Hotspots not transferring packets.
- We're going to improve communication and status of issues with this tool, subscribe

### Long week

It’s been a long week for Console and we’re sorry for any inconvenience.

Throughout this entire process we have tried to be transparent to keep users informed and updated as
best we could.

Releasing Data Credits live is an important milestone and these updates need to be made before any
devices started paying for packets and Hotspots can start earning rewards for transferring.

During testing we have discovered issues that we’ll need additional time to fix and test.

**Therefore the team has decided to push the phase 3 Data Credits live date from 8/4 to 8/11.**

Until then device users will continue to connect without needing Data Credits, and Hotspots will
continue earning as usual.

### What went wrong

These state channel v2 changes are a massive protocol update for the
[blockchain](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/543). We've needed to test state
channels to ensure devices correctly pay for connectivity with Data Credits, and verify correct
communication between the Console backend (Router), and Hotspots to accept the offer and sent
packets to the desired location. There was an issue with state channels not correctly spaced out and
a gap ensued. This communication issue between state channels and Router prevented packets from
being forwarded. We
[updated chain vars](https://github.com/helium/miner/blob/master/audit/var-36.md) to fix this issue.

Another [issue](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/294) prevented Hotspots from forwarding
packets despite otherwise normally participating in POC challenges.

We pushed out a fix this afternoon which includes a mechanism that allows a Hotspot to connect to
Console when transferring packets.

### Better communication

To improve communication going forward in addition to Discord announcements, we will ensure Console
backend (Router) status is kept up to date [here](http://status.helium.com/).

This tool will allow us to better provide status updates in real time, and we will also use it for
future planned maintenance updates. Please subscribe to get updated in real time.

After Data Credits go live, we will give much more advanced notice for future maintenance updates
that may result in interruption of packet transfers and minimize the time frame for disruptions.
However, we don’t anticipate needing to make any fundamental infrastructure changes that rival the
scope of the work that caused this outage.

### We’re sorry

All the teams, blockchain, firmware, Console work very hard with the community to build this network
and the tools needed to use it and our sincerest apologies for the interruptions.
