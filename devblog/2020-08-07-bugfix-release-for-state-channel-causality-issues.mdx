This `2020.08.06.0` release fixes a few issues related to state channel v2 causality problems we
were seeing on chain. Essentially, we see hotspots file a duplicate state channel close txn despite
the fact that the router has already submitted one. This release attempts to fix that.

We also fixed some reported concerns of miners crashing when trying to send packets to router.

Additionally, the blessed snapshot was bumped to 447121.
