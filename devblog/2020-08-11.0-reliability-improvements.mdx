This `2020.08.11.0` release fixes another out of memory condition during elections, it also fixes an
issue with transactions larger than 65kb and finally it improves restart behavior when certain
essential processes crash.

### Contents

- _Reduce memory overhead during elections_: PR:
  - [blockchain-core/563](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/563)
- _Improve hbbft transaction encoding/decoding robustness_: PR:
  - [hbbft/58](https://github.com/helium/erlang-hbbft/pull/58)
- _Rework miner supervisor tree_: PR:
  - [miner/450](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/450)

### Plan

We will beta `2020.08.11.0` this afternoon PST and release it to GA on an accelerated schedule
because the transaction encoding fix is not backwards compatible.
