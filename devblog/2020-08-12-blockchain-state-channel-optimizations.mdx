This `2020.08.12.0` release addresses some of the concerns regarding the opening/closing of state
channels responsible for packet transfer. Essentially it allows the router to maintain state
channels better as we have introduced proper rollover of the channels on DC exhaustion.

Lastly, we removed a lot of extraneous logging which should improve performance on the Hotspots.
