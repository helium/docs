This `2020.08.21.0` provides an implementation of
[HIP-10](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0010-usage-based-data-transfer-rewards.md). The
implementation is gated behind a chain var, which we will activate once everyone has upgraded and
we've finalized and announced an activation date and time.
