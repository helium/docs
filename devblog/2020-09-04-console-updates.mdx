This release includes the ability to manually downlink from Console, UI updates, and a number of
Router (backend) fixes related to packet transfer.

<!--truncate-->

### Features

- Allow users to manually test downlink for a device from within Console. Instructions
  [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/integrations/http/#downlink-tool-example).
- Updated event logs to add categories for errors.
- Provided ability on the Device index page to choose the number of devices to display on screen.
- Added the ability to apply bulk actions to all devices.

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue related to a state channel causality check that caused packet loss and the
  ability for devices to rejoin.
- Downlink payloads no longer incorrectly display as empty in the Debug Window.
- Addressed an issue that devices may have trouble joining due to initially connecting to a Hotspot
  with weak RSSI. To resolve multiple copies of packets may be purchased, but users are only charged
  for one. Only the Hotspot that forwards the packet earns rewards.
- Released a patch to address the issue of DIY Hotspots not able to transfer data. As a reminder
  regardless of Hotspot (DIY or “official”) devices need to pay Data Credits to transfer data.
- An issue of communication between Console and Router that led to dots or events occasionally not
  updating correctly has been fixed.
- Labels no longer auto expand within Console when navigating content.
- Fixed issue preventing scrolling left nav with many Labels.

### Upcoming

The team’s focus in the coming weeks (usual disclaimers apply):

- Provide ability to pause data transfer for a device or an Organization.
- Make debug information easier to view.
- Update MQTT integration to allow more flexibility.
- Include support for LoRaWAN adaptive data rate (ADR).
- Release Console and its backend network server and blockchain components (Router) as open source.
