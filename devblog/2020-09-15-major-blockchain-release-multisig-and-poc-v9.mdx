The `2020.09.15.0` release is a major blockchain release adding support for two features: `Multisig`
and `POC-v9`.

<!--truncate-->

#### Multisig

Currently, Helium is the sole entity involved in proposing and issuing chain variables which control
the behavior of the blockchain. This is done via signing the chain variable txn using a single
authoritative key. With the introduction of multisig, we go from having a single key to a group of
keys, a majority of which will be required to sign a chain var txn. This change is guarded behind
`use_multi_keys` chain variable and will be in effect once we activate it.

#### Proof-of-Coverage V9

POC V9 now checks and validates witnesses and receipts contained within a POC transaction by
checking whether the reported RSSI, SNR and Frequency are within reasonable bounds. We have also
added `channel` and `datarate` fields to poc-witness and poc-receipt record definitions. This change
is guarded behind two chain variables that the team will activate once we GA the release. The
proposed chain variable updates are:

- `poc_version` from 8 to 9
- `data_aggregation_version` from 1 to 2

Additionally, we also improved logging to better debug POC related issues. Finally, this release
bumps the blessed snapshot to height 499681.
