The `2020.09.16.0` emergency release addresses the chain halt we observed after activating PoC-v9.
The team will continue to closely monitor the situation but we're fairly confident that this update
will get the blockchain moving again.

### Contents

With every chain variable update there's a little uncertainty that older code paths may get broken.
The team tries their best to test any such changes thoroughly but sometimes bugs slip through the
cracks.

#### What exactly happened?

- We believe that the root cause of the chain halt was the fact that we were re-validating
  `poc_receipts_txn` by using a lagging ledger while trying to absorb the transaction. We have
  addressed that by getting the required channel information for witnesses by walking the chain
  backwards instead of relying on a potentially old ledger.

- Furthermore, `rewards_txn` were being extremely expensive due to unnecessary logging, thereby
  causing IO issues. We have reduced the log levels from `info` to `debug` to address that.

### Plan

Since this is an emergency release, we have already began betaing it on some hotspots and will be
deploying it throughout the network around 5:30PM PST, Wednesday 16th Sept.
