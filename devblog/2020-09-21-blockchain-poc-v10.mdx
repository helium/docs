The `2020.09.21.1` blockchain release adds support for `PoC v10`.

<!--truncate-->

With the release of `PoC v9`, the blockchain experienced a halt and subsequent block slow down,
please refer
[here](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/09/17/blockchain-poc-v9-postmortem.html)
for further details. This release addresses the performance issues the team noticed with `PoC v9`.

#### Proof-of-Coverage v10

`PoC v10` remains practically the same as `PoC v9` in principle except the addition of
`request_block_hash` in the `poc_receipts_txn` to allow fetching valid receipt and witness
information in an optimized manner.

The proposed chain variable updates are:

- `poc_version` from 8 to 10
- `data_aggregation_version` from 1 to 2

Aditionally, this release bumps the blessed snapshot to height `509761`.
