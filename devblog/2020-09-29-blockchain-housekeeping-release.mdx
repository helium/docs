The `2020.09.30.1` release is a regular blockchain maintenance update. Notably, the team has added
support for providing witness validity information to Proof of Coverage receipts, fixed blockchain
snapshot determinism and updated state channel client to make device join accepts more robust.

#### Witness Validation Visibility

`blockchain-core` now provides visibility for Proof of Coverage witness validation. This would allow
network participants to better correlate their PoC mining rewards with `poc_receipts_txn` paths.
This is intended to be used by [blockchain-etl](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) and the
API. Ultimately this data will be visible in explorer and the Helium mobile wallet.

#### Snapshot Determinism Fixes

Another minor change was made to make snapshot serialization more deterministic. While this would
not normally merit a mention, these serialization issues are making it less likely that any given
Hotspot will generate and store a correct snapshot, which has two effects that that a user might
notice:

1. It makes it harder for the Consensus Group to generate a snapshot, because two-thirds of the
   group needs to agree. This means that snapshots fail more often than they should and there are
   fewer to choose from when it comes time to bless the latest.

2. Since fewer Hotspots agree, it's less likely that any given Hotspot will agree about the snapshot
   hash and store it. New Hotspots coming on to the network have to look around for longer to find a
   snapshot. Currently, agreement seems to have fallen into two major groups covering around 75% of
   all spots with a long tail of smaller groups.

#### Device JoinAccept Fixes

This release also addresses concerns related to client devices not being able to send join requests
to the console without repeated attempts. We updated the state channel client on the miner to
properly enqueue and dequeue packets once the router accepts an incoming packet offer from a
Hotspot.

#### Blessed Snapshot Update

Finally, this release bumps the blessed snapshot to height `522721` which will improve sync times of
newly onboarded Hotspots.

### Plan

We will begin beta-testing `2020.09.30.1` around 4 PM PST on 30th September, 2020 and plan to
release it to GA by 11 AM PST, 1st October, 2020.
