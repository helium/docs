The team has overhauled MQTT integration to make topic composition more flexible and added templates
to use for device and org identifiers.

<!--truncate-->

Existing MQTT Integrations should continue to work fine. However, should you encounter any issues
related to data transfer due to MQTT integration, simply update the topics on those existing
integrations.

### Features and Updates

- MQTT topic composition and UI update: In addition, to interface updates to make it more similar to
  other integrations, we have also overhauled the topic composition, making it more flexible, and
  included templating which provides an easy way to insert device ID, and key information should you
  want to include that in your topic structure.
- Topics should follow MQTT topic rules. Templates can be provided using \{\{template}} format.
  Valid template tags are: `device_id`, `device_eui`, `app_eui`, and `organization_id`.
- During TTN import provided the ability to delete application handlers to avoid rejoin attempts
  after import.
- UI enhancements:
  - Debug mode: moved Packet Information to top and expanded by default.
  - Updated retransmission procedure to align with LoRaWAN spec.
  - Added ability to delete devices on specific Device page.
  - Added confirmation for Organization delete even if no devices.

### Fixes

- Import TTN devices consistently appears in the Console device list.
- Resolved an issue with search to ensure results are clear.
- Fcnt in Debug mode aligns with Console event information.
- New data in the event log consistently appears.
- Addressed an HTTPS cert issue that was causing issues with certain HTTP endpoint integrations.
- A device no longer requires two join attempts before a join accept is downlinked if a device does
  not already have an established session.

### Upcoming

The teamâ€™s focus in the coming weeks (usual disclaimers apply):

- Include support for LoRaWAN adaptive data rate (ADR).
- UI enhancements for sorting and filtering tables.
- Updates to event logs, more information, ability to export json format.
- Release Console and its backend network server and blockchain components (Router) as open source.
