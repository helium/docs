The primary objective of the `2020.10.08.0` release is to address the state channel overpayment
exploit. The fix is guarded behind `reward_version` chain variable which would be incremented to `4`
to activate the fix. We intend to activate this chain variable after verifying this release.

#### Addressing the State Channel Overpayment Exploit

When a `state_channel_close` transaction is in a `dispute` state, Data Credit (DC) rewards were
always paid out 1:1. Prior to this release, it was not considered that a state channel could have
closed with a total DC count higher than the amount of DC available to the state channel.

Furthermore, since the router always opens state channels with an "overcommit" factor (set to 2 on
the blockchain as a chain variable), router has an incentive to recover the overcommit amount and
pay the client Hotspots involved in the state channel.

To address this, after we set `reward_version` to `4`, we would fully remove the overcommitted DC
amount and only pay out the participants of the state channel proportionally after truncating any
large participant payouts to the amount of DC in the state channel.

#### Prep for Proof-of-Coverage Changes

For those following [Helium Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/helium/hip), there are a few
proposals on reworking the proof-of-coverage mechanism. The team has removed the artificial max
limit of potential witnesses a PoC packet may have and made it an on-chain variable, this change
would allow us to gather more witnesses per PoC hop. The proposed chain variable is:
`poc_per_hop_max_witnesses`, and is currently set at a default of `5` to preserve existing behavior.

#### Several Test Changes and API related Changes

- Updated miner and blockchain-core tests to be more reliable and significantly reduced test
  runtime.

- Addressed a few bugs related to the exported json data for poc receipt transactions.

- Fixed a bug in ledger fingerprinting.

- Added EU868 specific datarates for PoC packets.

- Altered block catchup time calculation to produce more consistently spaced blocks and faster
  emissions rate catchup.

#### Blessed Snapshot Update

Finally, this release bumps the blessed snapshot to height `535681` which will improve sync times of
newly onboarded Hotspots.

it to GA by 2 PM PST, 9th October, 2020.
