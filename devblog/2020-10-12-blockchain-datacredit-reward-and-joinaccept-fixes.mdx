The primary objective of the `2020.10.12.1` release is to address the missing data credit rewards
for `blockchain_txn_state_close_v1` transaction. This release also fixes inconsistent `JoinAccept`
for packet transfers.

#### Addressing the Missing DataCredit Rewards

When a `blockchain_txn_state_channel_close_v1` transaction appears between the next epoch start
(next election block for new consensus group) and the grace period of the state channel close (as
defined in the corresponding open state channel transaction), there's a possibility that the data
credit rewards for hotspots involved in packet transfer for the duration of the state channel would
not appear in the next epoch. The team has addressed this bug and to preserve backwards
compatability guarded the change behind chain variable `reward_version`.

Once `reward_version` is set to `5` the fix will come into effect and data credit rewards will
appropriately appear in the corresponding epoch change.

#### Addressing Inconsistent JoinAccept for Packet Transfer

The team has addressed reported concerns for inconsistent `JoinAccept` for packet transfers as
reported by network users. This was caused due a regression in refactoring old code. We expect
`JoinAccept` to be more consistent once `2020.10.12.1` release goes GA. Note, this does _not_
require a chain variable to trigger.

#### Blessed Snapshot Update

Finally, this release bumps the blessed snapshot to height `540721` which will improve sync times of
newly onboarded Hotspots.
