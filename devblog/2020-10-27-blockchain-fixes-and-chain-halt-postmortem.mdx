#### October 26th, 2020: Chain halt postmortem

- _11AM PST_: Miner tag `2020.10.23.0` is released to GA
- _4:30PM PST_: The team notices chain stall and begins investigation
- _5:00PM PST_: Root cause identified as an unhandled `EXIT` error message caused while trying to
  create a block containing a stale poc receipt transaction. Patch deployed to the consensus group
  to regain block production.
- _5:30PM PST_: After having internal discussions, the team decided to roll back to previous GA tag
  `2020.10.12.1`. It was not worth it to rush a release, especially knowing that the bug was largely
  harmless and the previous GA had been running solidly.
- _6:00PM PST_: All hotspots on the network downgraded back to `2020.10.12.1`. By this time, network
  gossip caught up and block production resumed normally.
