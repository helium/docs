In this release we provide support for a second receive window, a number of UI improvements, as well
as a beta feature that allows users customize JSON messages sent to Integrations.

<!--truncate-->

### Features and Updates

- Included a second receive window for devices aligned with LoRaWAN spec.
- Increased Data Credit visibility: total for Organization prominently displayed, as well as on
  specific device page.
- Group import capability supports adding an additional labelID column in the CSV file for imports.
- Labels can be quickly swapped from one to another from the quick action menu. For example, if
  Labels were defined for location (SF, LA), and a device moved from SF to LA, users could easily
  swap these location Labels for devices. This same feature could be used to define different
  customers, POC vs. production devices, etc.
- Included pause/resume device transfer on Device index page quick action menu.
- Significantly improved uplink speed by caching devices instead of needing to query DB each time.
- Beta - JSON Message Templates: provide users the ability to customize the JSON message sent to
  HTTP, MQTT or AWS IoT Integrations. This is a beta feature and we expect only users familiar with
  templating to try this feature. More info about the logic-less Mustache templating we're using
  [here](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).

```json
{
// Browan example
  {% raw %}{{#decoded}}{{#payload}} {% endraw %}
  "battery": {% raw %}"{{battery_percent}}"{% endraw %},
  "lat": {% raw %}"{{latitude}}"{% endraw %},
  "long": {% raw %}"{{longitude}},{{payload}}{{decoded}}"{% endraw %}
  "device_id": {% raw %}"{id}}"{% endraw %}
}
```

- Current list of template of supported keys and values:

```json

  "id": "device_uuid",
  "name": "device_name",
  "dev_eui": "dev_eui",
  "app_eui": "app_eui",
  "metadata": {},
  "fcnt": 2,
  "reported_at": 123,
  "payload": "base64 encoded payload",
  // ONLY if payload is decoded
  "decoded": {
    "status": "success | error",
    "error": "...",
