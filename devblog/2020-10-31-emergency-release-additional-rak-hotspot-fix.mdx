The team has prepared a second emergency weekend release, tagged `2020.10.31.1`. This release
addresses a software issue that affects _only_ a subset of the RAK Hotspot Miners, which were unable
to witness challenges or build witness lists.

<!--truncate-->

RAK Hotspot Miner owners who purchased from Cal-Chip with a Rev 1.2 Rasberry Pi 4 board would have
noticed that there was no improvement with the prior emergency release today (tag `2020.10.31.0`).
During our initial testing with the RAK Hotspot Miner, we identified one revision of this board but
did not expect this new one before they were released to the public. We believe that this fix will
at least handle the new revision for the weekend and we'll look at a more holistic change over the
next week.

**Helium Hotspots are not affected by this issue.**

Be advised that there's still a possibility that the RAK Hotspot Miners may fail to update to the
new release `2020.10.31.1` for the same boot pin misconfiguration as described in the
[prior post](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/10/31/emergency-release-rak-hotspot-fix.html)
and may require an power cycle after 30 minutes of operating with the new firmware.

### Plan

We are currently beta testing `2020.10.31.1` and we will release to GA imminently. Current ETA for
GA is 9:00 PM PST, October 31st 2020.
