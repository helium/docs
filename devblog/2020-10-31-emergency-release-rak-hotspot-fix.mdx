The team has prepared an emergency weekend release, tagged `2020.10.31.0`. This release addresses a
software issue that affects _only_ the RAK Hotspot Miner where they were unable to witness
challenges or build witness lists.

<!--truncate-->

For folks who have a RAK Hotspot Miner purchased from Cal-Chip, they would have noticed that their
Hotspot has no witnesses but there are potentially valid hotspots in their area. On the bright side,
the RAK Hotspot Miners have been issuing challenges and maintaining blockchain sync.

**Helium Hotspots are not affected by this issue.**

### Advisory for RAK Hotspot Miner Owners

Despite this fix, there's a non-zero chance that some RAK Hotspot Miners may fail to update to the
new release `2020.10.31.0`. If an operator notices no Proof-of-Coverage Witness or Challengee
Participant activity, we request them to manually power cycle their Hotspot after waiting ~30
minutes. The failure to update to the GA seems to happen due to mis-configuration of boot pins on
the RAK Hotspot Miners, the team is actively investigating this and will prepare another release mid
next week to address whether we can fix this issue in software.

### Plan

We are currently beta testing `2020.10.31.0` and we will release to GA imminently. Current ETA for
GA is 11:30 AM PST, October 31st 2020.
