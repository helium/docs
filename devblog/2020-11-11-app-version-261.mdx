In this new update, we've made it easier for anyone to send the full amount of HNT in their wallet.
You no longer have to worry about calculating the transaction fee.

## Support for other transaction types

Security Tokens transactions and mining rewards are now supported.

# Performance Fixes

# Security Fixes

## Android PIN Bypass

A Helium Discord community member alerted us of a change in behaviour in the Android mobile app
where a bad actor can access the account screen, completely bypassing the PIN screen if auto-rotate
is enabled in their phone settings. This is a security vulnerability and can allow bad actors to
access your wallet and funds.

**We strongly recommend ALL Android app users update to app v2.6.1.**

Special thanks to @Weelecht for discovering this vulnerability.

# Bug Fixes

## DC Display Amount

We now show the correct amount of Data Credits generated when burning HNT.
