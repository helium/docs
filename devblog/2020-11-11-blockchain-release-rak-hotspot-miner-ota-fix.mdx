The team has prepared a new blockchain chain release tagged `2020.11.10.0` addressing a key issue
where RAK Hotspot Miners would not properly update to new firmware OTAs.

<!--truncate-->

We have described the issue in depth
[here](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/11/06/blockchain-release-rak-miner-updates.html),
this release aims to fix that. RAK Hotspot Miner owners will now be able to seamlessly update to new
firmwares as they come along.

Furthermore, we have updated the snapshot block to `583201` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to
sync faster to the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2020.11.10.0` since November 10th, 2020 and will release to GA
imminently. Current ETA for GA is 12:00 PM PST, November 11th 2020.
