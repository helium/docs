# Performance Fixes

- Migrate legacy secure store data in preparation for new app version (v3). We recommend all users
  update to this new app version. Failure to update to this version could mean losing access to your
  Wallet/Account and associated Hotspots if a user directly upgrades from 2.6.1 to 3.x.x. as a
  restore from the deprecated secure store will no longer be supported. This is also a good reminder
  to write down the 12 words used to generate the wallet's private key. You can find those 12 words
  by launching the Helium App > More > Advanced > Reveal 12 Words.

# Bug Fixes

## Android 8.0.0

Some Samsung Galaxy S7 users running Android 8.0.0 were unable to launch the app due to a splash
screen size issue. We've optimized the logic for those types of devices so that it pulls a smaller
file instead. Users will be able to launch the app once they update to 2.7.0.

## iPhone 12 Pro Max Layout Fix

New iPhone 12 Pro Max users saw a layout issue with the navigation menu. This is now fixed.

## Hotspot Offline Notification Icon clipped

The Hotspot Offline Notification had a clipped icon. This is fixed.
