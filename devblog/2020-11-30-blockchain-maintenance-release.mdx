The `2020.11.30.0` release is a minor blockchain maintenance release. The primary goal of this
release is to bump the blessed snapshot.

<!--truncate-->

#### Blessed Snapshot Update

This release also bumps the blessed snapshot to height `609841` which will improve sync times of
newly onboarded Hotspots.

#### Transaction Type Sort Ordering

This release also addresses a minor issue with transaction type sort ordering for block ingestion on
nodes syncing from the genesis block. This should not affect any running instances of the miner but
useful for the blockchain team for testing code changes and for audits.
