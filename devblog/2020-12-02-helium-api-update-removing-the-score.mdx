With the release of
[HIP 16](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0016-random-consensus-group-election.md) and
implementation of
[Random Consensus Group selection](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2020/11/18/blockchain-release-feature-updates.html),
the PoC-based Hotspot Score is no longer a metric that's used by the Helium blockchain. We intend to
completely remove the `score` field from the
[API response](https://developer.helium.com/blockchain/api/api-hotspots#hotspot-for-address).

<!--truncate-->

To ease the transition to removing it entirely, we've adjusted all Hotspot scores to `1`. This
change was made earlier today, December 2, 2020 around 1:15 PM PT.

We plan on deploying an additional change on Monday, December 7, 2020 around 10AM PT to completely
remove the field. If you're currently a consumer of the API and depend on this field, please take
this time to update your clients / applications.

There will be a subsequent code change that updates the `blockchain-etl` project to remove this from
the database as well.
