The team has successfully deployed support for
[HIP 15](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md) and
[HIP 17](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0017-hex-density-based-transmit-reward-scaling.md)
and switched to a beacon-only PoC model. One of the things we decided not to change with all of the
other chain variables this morning was an increase to the number of max witnesses for each PoC. Now
that we are confident with the way the Consensus Group is able to handle the new PoC receipts and
new rewards calculations, we feel like it's safe to increase the max number of witnesses in each PoC
receipt.

<!--truncate-->

Previously, we allowed maximum PoC path length of 5 with each PoC hop allowed to have 5 max
witnesses. This implied that the total number of witnesses per PoC transaction would be 25 (best
case scenario). In the beacon-only model, since there's only a single challengee (beaconer) who
would transmit a PoC packet, we are increasing the witness limit from 5 to 25.

#### Proposed Chain Variable

| Chain Variable            | Proposed Value | Reason                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| poc_per_hop_max_witnesses | 25             | Increased to allow more witnesses per PoC beacon |

### Plan

We plan on issuing the chain variable transaction at 3PM PST on Wednesday, Dec 16 2020. We will
update this post to reflect the transaction on chain when it goes live.
