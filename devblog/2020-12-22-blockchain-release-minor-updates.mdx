The team has a new release tagged `2020.12.22.1` before the holidays with a snapshot bump and
blockchain core support for showing invalid witnesses in the API. Please read on for more details
and plan for GA.

<!--truncate-->

### [blockchain-core#706](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/706): Expose invalid witness reason

In order for the API to have consistency with the blockchain, blockchain-core now exports helper
functions which output the precise reasons why a particular PoC witness Hotspot was considered
invalid during ingestion of a PoC Receipt Transaction. The team has planned support for exposing
this information in explorer and Helium app via the blockchain API.

### [miner#586](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/586): Snapshot bump to 642961

We have updated the snapshot block to `642961` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2020.12.22.1` since December 22nd, 2020 7:00PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
11:00 AM PT, December 23rd, 2020.
