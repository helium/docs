The Helium team will be adjusting the `poc_v4_target_challenge_age` chain variable from `300` to
`1000` in order to align more closely with the current value of `poc_challenge_interval` (which is
currently set to `240`).

<!--truncate-->

This variable is a staleness check that miners use to determine if the hotspot being challenged has
been active recently enough for the challenge to succeed. Hotspots which have not themselves issued
a challenge in a long time are unlikely to be online or properly synced with the chain.

The `poc_v4_target_challenge_age` variable was originally set to `300` when the
`poc_challenge_interval` was set to `30` but never updated proportionally.

### Impact on Challenge Rate

We expect that adjusting this variable will increase the diversity of the hotspots being challenged.
As this affects all hotspots, it should have no aggregate impact on PoC rewards.

#### Proposed Chain Variable

| Chain Variable              | Old Value | New Value | Reason                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| poc_v4_target_challenge_age | 300       | 1000      | Mirror the change in the challenge interval. |

### Plan

We plan on issuing the chain variable transaction at 1PM PT on Wednesday, Dec 30 2020. We will
update this post to reflect the transaction on chain when it goes live.
