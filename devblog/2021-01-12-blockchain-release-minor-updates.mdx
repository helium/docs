The team has a new release tagged `2021.01.12.0` which contains minor bug fixes, test updates and a
snapshot bump. Please read further for more details.

<!--truncate-->

### [blockchain-core#704](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/704): Add hip17 beacon only test group

The team added more test cases which specifically address beacon specific HIP15/17 changes in
blockchain-core.

### [blockchain-core#710](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/710): Reduce log level for reward transaction

Just reduces the chatter when an error happens when a Hotspot is not found in gateway_cache.

### [blockchain-core#715](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/715): Detect missing request block hash

The team found a bug which was caused due to an unhandled case clause condition which would make
blockchain-etl drop sync with the chain when trying to tag witnesses for their invalidation reason.
This is now fixed.

### [miner#592](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/592): Fix POC to disallow self-witnessing

After doing some investigation on chain, the team found that there are instances where a Hotspot may
incorrectly witness itself for a PoC receipt transaction. This happens likely due to inconsistent
RF. We have updated miner to disallow any self-witnessing.

### [miner#596](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/596): Update blockchain and Snapshot

We have updated miner to use new blockchain-core and the snapshot block to `672481` to allow newly
onboarded hotspots to sync faster to the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.01.12.0` since January 12th, 2021 4:00PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
11:00 AM PT, January 13th, 2021.
