The team has a new emergency release tagged `2021.01.17.0` which contains a bug fix to detect new
RAK Hotspot Hardware.

<!--truncate-->

RAK Hotspot Miners shipped in late 2020 and January 2021 have a new hardware version that the
firmware was unable to detect. Without the ability to identify the hardware, the Hotspot's packet
forwarder continuously crashed, preventing its ability to witness and PoC.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.01.17.0` since January 17th, 2021 10:30AM PT. Current ETA for GA is
11:00AM PT, January 17th, 2021.
