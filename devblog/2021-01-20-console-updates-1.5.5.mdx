In this release we’ve included beta support for LoRaWAN adaptive data rate (ADR), increased the
number of email notifications, and added a new API for multiple packet purchase. ADR allows devices
to use an optimal data rate which reduces power consumption and airtime on the network based on RF
conditions. It's recommended to only use this setting for fixed or non-mobile devices to ensure
reliable connectivity.

### Features and updates

- Added LoRaWAN adaptive data rate (ADR) support (beta). For flexibility we’ve included ADR as a
  Label setting which allows users to allow ADR settings for a group of devices. ADR needs to be
  requested by a device for this setting to have an effect. To access this setting, choose the Label
  from the side menu > click `Label Settings` > choose the `ADR (Beta)` tab.
- Provided an API to include ability to specify multiple packet purchases if coverage is available.
  Use a POST request: `https://console.helium.com/api/v1/labels/label_id/multi_buy` In Body
  Parameters, specify `value`: and choose [1-10] for the desired number of packets to purchase, 10 =
  all available packets.
- API reminders:
  - To obtain an API key, click the user icon in the top right corner > `My Account` >
    `Generate Key`. You will need to verify the API key via email before you can use it.
  - To obtain a Label UUID, Use a GET request: `https://console.helium.com/api/v1/labels/`
- Increase the number of email notifications for a number of conditions related to devices and
  integrations including when devices are deleted, Integrations updated or deleted.

### Fixes

- Deployed a patch that fixed a potential vulnerability for a Server Side Request Forgery
  vulnerability attack.
- Deployed a patch that prevents JoinRequest replay attacks.
- Sorting the device table no longer causes the Device table to hang.
- Fixed pixel shift when clicking top bar profile icon.
- Updated clickable areas on different tables (e.g., Devices, Integrations) to be consistent.
- Fixed an inaccurate display of device count when deleting a Label from an Integration.
- Resolved an issue that prevented certain users from confirming invitations.

### Upcoming

The team’s focus in the coming weeks (usual disclaimers apply):

- Provide the ability to send notifications via a web hook.
- Add APIs for notifications.
- Release Console and its backend network server and blockchain components (Router) as open source.
- Update the Event log to include more LoRaWAN-related information.
- Build foundation for a more visual-oriented interface for improved usability.
- Create a module to integrate with other LoRaWAN network servers, initially ChirpStack.
