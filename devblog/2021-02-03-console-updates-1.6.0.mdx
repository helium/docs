We’re excited to launch a beta release of Flows, a new user experience designed to simplify
performing Console core actions. Also, in this release notifications can be sent via webhooks, and
APIs for notifications have been added.

<!--truncate-->

With Flows (beta) users can: Instantly see the relationships between Labels, Integrations, and
Functions. Connect or disconnect Labels to Functions and Integrations and Changes made in the Flows
workspace are reflected in other areas of Console and vice versa. Remember to save changes.

Nodes are identified by the following:

- Labels: yellow
- Integrations: depends on integration type (HTTP, MQTT)
- Decoder functions: down arrows

We look forward to the experience Flows provides users and the additional features we plan on adding
over time.

### Features and updates

- Released Flows (beta) to accelerate connecting Labels to Functions and Integrations.
- Provided the ability to send notifications via webhooks. To access this setting, choose `Label`
  from the side menu > `Label Settings` > `Notifications` > `Webhooks`. To obtain a webhook key for
  authorization, choose `Organizations` from the side menu and copy relevant webhook key.
- Included APIs for email and webhook notifications.

  - Email: POST: https://console.helium.com/api/v1/labels/:label_id/notification_email
  - Body Parameters:

  ```
      {
      `key`: `device_deleted`,
      `value`: `1`,
      `recipients`: `admin`
      }
  ```

  - Webhooks: Email: POST: https://console.helium.com/api/v1/labels/:label_id/notification_webhook
  - Body Parameters:

  ```
      {
      `key`: `device_deleted`,
      `value`: `1`,
      `url`: `http://hello.com`
      `notes`: `hello world`
      }
  ```

  - _key_ matches notification type and must be one of following: `device_deleted`,
    `device_join_otaa_first_time`, `device_stops_transmitting`, `integration_stops_working`,
    `integration_receives_first_event`, `downlink_unsuccessful`, `integration_with_devices_deleted`,
    `integration_with_devices_updated`
  - _value_ must be `1` for all except for when _key_ is `device_stops_transmitting` when it should
    be the number of **minutes** to check that the device stopped transmitting for.
  - Email: _recipients_ must be one of: `admin`, `manager`, `read`, `all`
  - Webhook: _url_ must be the webhook url, and _notes_ is optional.

  - To obtain an API key, click the user icon in the top right corner > `My Account` >
    `Generate Key`. You will need to verify the API key via email before you can use it.
  - To obtain a Label UUID, use a GET request: `https://console.helium.com/api/v1/labels/`
