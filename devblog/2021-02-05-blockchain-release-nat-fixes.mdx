regular snapshot bump. Please read further for details.

<!--truncate-->

### [erlang-libp2p#313](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/313): Do not try infinite leases on NAT-PMP, lease time of 0 means delete

The team noticed that the NAT matrix in libp2p would attempt infinite leases in
[NAT-PMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_Port_Mapping_Protocol) mode, this is unsupported and
it's been fixed.

### [miner#616](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/616): Bump miner snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `706321` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.02.05.0` since February 5th, 2021 11:00 AM PT. Current ETA for GA is
2:00 PM PT, February 5th, 2021.
