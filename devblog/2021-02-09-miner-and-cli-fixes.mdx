The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.02.09.2` which contains a reliabiliy fix for consensus
group members and some CLI fixes.

<!--truncate-->

### [miner#612](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/612): Have consensus manager monitor miner process

This improves the behaviour of the consensus manager when the miner process crashes. This could lead
to a consensus member failing to run the consensus group, lowering the group's resilience to
failure.

### [miner#619](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/619): Useablity improvments to miner info commands

Community contribution from maco2035.

### [miner#614](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/612): Remove staging router from default_routers list

This is work towards enabling other routers to manage their own routing tables.

### [miner#622](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/622): Bump miner snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `706321` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.02.09.2` since around 10:00 AM PT, February 9th, 2021. Current ETA
for GA is 2:00 PM PT, February 9th, 2021.
