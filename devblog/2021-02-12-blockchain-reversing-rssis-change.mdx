### Contents

The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.02.12.0` which reverts the RSSIS change from
`2021.02.10.4`. This change, while correct, interacts poorly with our existing PoC acceptance
criteria and we're reverting it temporarily while we fix those.

### [miner#638](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/638): Revert "Use packet_rssi function to use RSSIS is available"

We've decided to revert this change as it was causing distant witnessing to be incorrectly penalized
in PoC.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.02.12.0` since February 12th, 2021 7:00 AM PT. Current ETA for GA is
10:30 AM PT, February 12th, 2021.
