with a snapshot bump.

### [miner#641](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/641): Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `725761` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

We have been beta testing `2021.02.18.0` since February 18th, 2021 2:00 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
12:30 PM PT, February 19th, 2021.
