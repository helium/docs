# 3.0.0 A Brand New App!

After months of waiting, weâ€™re so happy to announce the new version of the Helium Hotspot app is
here! Version 3.0 introduces a whole new design and introduces a new way to interact with the app.
Gone are the days of scrolling for hours toiling over challenges (we have Explorer for that!).

<!--truncate-->

We go into a bit more detail in our
[blog here](https://blog.helium.com/a-brand-new-app-for-hotspots-969956630ef9), and some
[background](https://blog.helium.com/an-evolution-of-the-helium-app-fc3fa52f77d5?source=collection_home---4------15-----------------------)
on why we decided to go this direction.

### New Languages!

As part of the Network expansion into Asia, we now support Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Other
languages coming soon.

### New Makers!

The app now allows you to select new Hotspots like Nebra and Syncrobit. Get excited!

# Known Issues

There are a few known issues that the team are working hard to fix and will deploy in the next few
days.

1. Adding a Hotspot to an account with 0 HNT gives an infinite loading Wallet screen (#284)
   - Workaround: Make sure you have >0 HNT balance in the wallet
2. Sending your entire account balance (using Send Max) shows a black screen after sending (#285)
   - Workaround: close the app and reopen. The transaction will succeed.
