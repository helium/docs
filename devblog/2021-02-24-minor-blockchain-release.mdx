The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.02.23.0` which contains a regular maintenance update
with an update to the seed nodes and a snapshot bump.

<!--truncate-->

### [miner#648](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/648): Update Seed IP addresses

We have updated the list of seed node IP addresses to match with the new nodes that were brought
online this week. These new nodes should improve relay connectivity for miners behind firewalls/NAT.
Apologies for the emergency firmware release, old seed node infrastructure forced an IP change, the
new IP addresses can be reassigned to different instances, which should keep this kind of thing from
happening in the future.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `733681` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.02.23.0` since February 23rd, 2021 4:00 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
7:00 PM PST, February 23th, 2021.
