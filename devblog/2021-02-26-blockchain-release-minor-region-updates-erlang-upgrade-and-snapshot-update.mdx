The team has a new release tagged `2021.02.26.0`. This is mostly minor from a Hotspot owner
perspective but there are some major infrastructural improvements which will help us continue to
maintain the code base including an upgrade to Erlang/OTP 23. We also included some region updates
and a snapshot bump.

### Support Erlang/OTP 23

Most of the miner and blockchain code base uses Erlang so this is a much needed upgrade to the next
version of Erlang/OTP. We are now able to run on OTP 23 and anticipate upgrading to OTP 24 when it
is released soon. This required changes to many of the repositories including miner,
blockchain-core, and other dependencies.

### Build changes to support new architectures

Thanks to the efforts of community member `@jerm#0817` (Discord) /
[`@ke6jjj`](https://github.com/ke6jjj) we've been able to land several updates to dependencies to
enable compilation of our blockchain on FreeBSD and the Apple M1. Thanks!

### [miner#652](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/652) Support Cayman Islands

Thanks to community member [`@w0ts0n`](https://github.com/w0ts0n) who added support in miner for the
Cayman Islands. I _cyah_ wait to see the network grow!

### [miner#640](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/640) Support North Macedonia

We also added support for North Macedonia so hotspots can use the EU868 frequency range.

### [miner#656](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/656) Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `738001` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### [blockchain-core#732](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/732) Speedup Ledger CLI

Small update to help speed up a useful commandline interface that miner operators will appreciate.

### [hbbft#61](https://github.com/helium/hbbft/pull/61) Test Improvements

Welcome to the team [`@xandkar`](https://github.com/xandkar). First merge that made it to
production!

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.02.26.0` since February 26rd, 2021 1:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
3:00 PM PST, February 28th, 2021.
