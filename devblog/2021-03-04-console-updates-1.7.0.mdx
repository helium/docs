We’re excited to announce the release of Helium Console under the Apache 2.0 license. Console joins
a growing list of Helium open source projects including blockchain core, the wallet, the blockchain
explorer, the Helium app and others

<!--truncate-->

To host your own version of Console, the github repository is
[here](https://github.com/helium/console) and documentation can be found
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/run-a-network-server).

The team also added support for Asian countries, as well as adding another prebuilt integration with
leading IoT platform Datacake.

### Features and updates

- Released Console as open source to increase decentralization and accelerate usage
- Regional support for Asia, specifically AS920-923 (“AS1”) and AS923-925 (“AS2”), opening up the
  biggest region in the world, to the world’s largest public IoT network
- Delivered Datacake pre-built integration allowing Datacake community to start using The People’s
  Network in a few clicks.
- Added associated integrations and functions on individual device pages for increased visibility
  and easier management.

### Fixes

- Addressed an issue that prevented using a server IP address with integrations.
- Pushed a patch that resolved issues with the live data graph.

### Upcoming

The team’s focus in the coming weeks (usual disclaimers apply):

- Downlink management capabilities
- Update Event log to include more LoRaWAN-related information.
- Continue to add regional support (Australia)
- Create a module to integrate with other LoRaWAN network servers, initially ChirpStack.
- Update Console core design based on Flows (beta) feedback
