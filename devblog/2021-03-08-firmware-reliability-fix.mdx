The team has a new release tagged `2021.03.08.0`. This release includes a fix to Hotspot firmware
where onboarding keys were incorrectly generated, a snapshot bump to `750241`, and several
reliability fixes that were identified in our Validators Testnet.

### Hotspot Firmware Update [miner#679](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/679)

Release `2021.03.04.0` included a fix for Hotspots crashing early on boot because it would fail to
get the onboarding key. The fix inadvertently caused a new onboarding key to be generated if there
was none found. This is not the correct logic for Hotspots, since the onboarding key is the public
key of the Hotspot.

This meant that when a user tries to onboard a Hotspot with this firmware image (can happen if they
leave it connected to internet and it received an OTA before they `add_hotspot`), they will get an
onboarding error message.

The fix is to no longer generate a key if none exists.

### Consensus Group Reliability Updates

Several improvements have been backported from the validators branch including reductions of
CPU/memory use due to better garbage collection of old consensus and election groups as well as a
fix to eject bad nodes from the consensus group when proposing a new consensus group. These
improvements should lead to smoother block and election times.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.03.08.0 ` since March 8th, 2021 11:00 AM PT. Current ETA for GA is
March 8th, 2021 2:00 PM PT.
