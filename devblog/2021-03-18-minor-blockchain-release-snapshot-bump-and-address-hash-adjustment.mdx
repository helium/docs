The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.03.18.0` which contains a regular maintenance update
with a snapshot bump and a minor update to the address hash.

<!--truncate-->

### [miner#697](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/697): Minor Address Hash Update

We have made a minor tuning change to the bloom filter introduced in a prior release. We've slightly
adjusted the false positive rate out of an abundance of caution but don't expect this to have any
impact to address hash identification.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `764641` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.03.18.0` since March 18th, 2021 12:20 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
3:00 PM PT, March 18th, 2021.
