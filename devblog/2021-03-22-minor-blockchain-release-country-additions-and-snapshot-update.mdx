The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.03.22.0` which contains a regular maintenance update
with an update to the countries supported by the miner codebase and a snapshot bump.

<!--truncate-->

### Several country additions

We've added 105 new countries to the list of countries supported by the miner codebase. You can see
specific updates
[here](https://github.com/helium/miner/commit/0be57098e3c28700b3724f752f7b0d779710d5d2). Thanks to
[@shawaj](https://github.com/shawaj) and others in the community for these updates.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `770401` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.03.22.0` since March 22nd, 2021 2:15 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
3:30 PM PT, March 22nd, 2021.
