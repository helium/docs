The team has a new release tagged `2021.03.24.0` which contains a significant overhaul of the
Rewards transaction and maintenance improvements including a regular snapshot bump.

### [core#751](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/751) Rewards v2

The bulk of this release is enabling support for a new kind of reward transaction on chain. The
transaction itself has been significantly improved to be smaller, more efficiently produced, and
easier to gossip to nodes on the network (due to size). As more Hotspots come online and validators
are introduced to the network, the rewards transaction becomes a bottleneck on the network's ability
to produce blocks and becomes a more significant component to ledger size. We have not made any
changes to the calculation of rewards so there will be no impact to actual rewards issued on the
network.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `774001` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.03.24.0` since March 24th, 2021 5:15 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
2:00 PM PT, March 25th, 2021.

The Rewards v2 transaction will not be used on chain until a chain variable is issued on chain,
likely early next week. This will require an upgrade by all blockchain participants before chain
variable activation. We will be updating all downstream projects, including `blockchain-etl` and
`blockchain-node`, and updating Docker images when `2021.03.24.0` is released to GA.
