The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.03.26.0` which contains a regular maintenance update
with an improvement to the performance of distributed key generation used in consensus and a
snapshot bump.

<!--truncate-->

### [dkg#35](https://github.com/helium/erlang-dkg/pull/35) DKG Performance Improvement

We identified an improvement to the distributed key generation protocol used by Consensus Group that
has been working well on the Testnet and are prepared to port it to Mainnet.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `776161` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.03.26.0` since March 26th, 2021 12:00 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
3:00 PM PT, March 26th, 2021.
