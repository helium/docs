The team made a number of core backend fixes related to downlinks, and initial device joins. Debug
mode, and the event log also received updates.

<!--truncate-->

After this release we’ll move to a three-week release cycle. While we’ll continue two-week sprints,
an additional week will be used for testing both internally and with third parties.

This extended-release cycle is part of our move to increase quality of releases and requires
building a three-tier development environment which includes: dev, staging, and production.

### Features and updates

- Debug mode updates: more descriptive headers, only displays relevant information categories, and
  position viewing events is kept constant as more events appear.
- Event log exports up to a limit of 1440 events in JSON format not just those displayed.
- Provided a visual way to identify if a device does not have an integration attached in the event
  log.
- Join accept events are consistent with colors used to represent downlinks.

### Fixes

- Provided an update to make sure downlink information was correctly reported.
- Included internal communication when downlinks are dropped.
- Increased accuracy to identify correct devaddrs.
- Provided a patch to help make initial device joins more consistent.
- Addressed race condition with multi-packet purchase.
- Tightened tests on data fields, including _reported at_ field.
- Fixed Console email formatting issues for certain mail clients and screen sizes.

### Open source users

- New users use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to quickly update Console/Router to the newest version which
  includes the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth operations. To update, check the
  newest instructions, rebuild, and restart. The database is not affected.
