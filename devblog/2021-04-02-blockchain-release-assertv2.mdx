The team has a new release tagged `2021.04.02.0` which contains a regular maintenance update with a
support for assert_location_v2 and a snapshot bump.

<!--truncate-->

### [blockchain#519](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/519) Assert Location v2

Feature work to allow remote assert location and the addition of two new values on chain (gain and
elevation). This feature is gated behind 3 chain variables, and activation will be announced next
week.

### Hardware Support

Added identifiction and support for 4GB Raspberry Pis.

### Miner/Blockchain Updates

Minor stability improvements to snapshot loading and startup improvements for low-memory units.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `786241` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.04.02.0` since April 2st, 2021 4:00 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
10:00 AM PT, April 3nd, 2021.

**UPDATE:** Due to a stable situation and light operator coverage, we are postponing GA until early
morning PT on April 5th, 2021. If the situation worsen or operators become available we may GA
before then.
