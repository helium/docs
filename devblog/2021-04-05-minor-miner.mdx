The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.04.05.0` which contains a minor bug fix that caused
the miner to restart every few hours, plus a snapshot bump.

<!--truncate-->

### [miner#721](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/721) Miner Update

### [blockchain#767](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/767) State Channel Update

A fix to how State Channels garbage collection works that causes the miner to unnecessarily restart.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `790561` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.04.05.0` since April 5th, 2021 3:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
5:15 PM PT, April 5th, 2021.
