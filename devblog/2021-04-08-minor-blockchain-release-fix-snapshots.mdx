The team has a new minor release tagged `2021.04.08.0` which contains a minor bug fix that addresses
an issue that prevented snapshots from being generated by the chain. We are deploying this change
today so that we can do a subsequent bump of the snapshot tomorrow. A list of other minor changes
are below.
