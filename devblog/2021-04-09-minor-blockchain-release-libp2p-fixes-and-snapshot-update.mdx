The team has a new minor, but urgent, release tagged `2021.04.09.0` which contains a bug fix to
libp2p. A latent bug was uncovered when we fixed another issue with the prior release. We are also
updating the snapshot with this release.

### Bump Snapshot

We have updated the snapshot block to `796321` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster to
the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.04.09.0` since April 9th, 2021 8:00 AM PT. Current ETA for GA is
10:00 AM PT, April 9th, 2021, or sooner.
