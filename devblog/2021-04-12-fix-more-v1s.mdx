The team has a new release tagged `2021.04.12.0` which contains a some fixes that should allow older
Hotspots to keep consuming the chain, as well as a snapshot bump.

### [blockchain#773](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/772) Fix Snapshot Generation on Older Hardware

Normally we don't spend a lot of time discussing the minor details of these releases, but one of the
reasons that we've done a lot of them in the past two weeks is that older units are having more and
more issues validating the chain as more Hotspots join the network. Mostly this takes the form of
the older hardware running out of memory on startup, which loops forever. We take this sort of thing
quite seriously, and it motivates a lot of recent work on our coming shift to Validator servers
instead of running the Consensus Group on individual Hotspots. Several fixes in the past two weeks
have contained fixes for these low memory units and all have helped, but have not completely
eliminated the problem.

This particular fix limits the number of attempts to generate a snapshot which, in our testing,
shows is a major point of failure on units with less RAM.

### Bump Snapshot

We have also updated the snapshot block to `800641` to allow newly onboarded hotspots to sync faster
to the current blockchain head block.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.04.12.0` since April 12th, 2021 1:15 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
3:00 PM PT, April 12th, 2021.
