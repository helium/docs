The team has a new release tagged `2021.04.14.0` containing an OTA Server Certificate Update.

<!--truncate-->

The Helium team manages the OTA server infrastructure that issues firmware updates over-the-air to
Helium Hotspots and RAK Hotspot Miners. The server has a signed certificate that enables Hotspots to
verify that it is from a trusted source through mutual authentication.

This update pushes a new certificate to the Helium Hotspots and RAK Hotspot Miners in preparation
for a server update this week.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.04.14.0` since April 14th, 2021 3:15 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
6:00 PM PT, April 14th, 2021.
