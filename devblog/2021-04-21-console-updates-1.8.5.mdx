This release was the first with our three-tier development environment and focused on improved
downlink capabilities and provided more details for LoRaWAN MAC commands for uplink events.

<!--truncate-->

### Features and updates

Event log

- Added MAC commands for uplink events.
- Included Hotspot column which provides the number of Hotspots that sent packets.
- Added a filter for events with commands.

Downlink

- Downlink provides the ability to schedule where a downlink is in the queue (first and last) and
  view which downlinks are queued.
- Updated downlink input to make more clear for supported formats (either base64 or plain text).

Debug mode

- Included a check box to expand all events.
- Included a flag in the header for events that contain decoded payloads.
- Decoded payload displays among multiple lines.

Integrations:

- Provided a visual way to identify if a device's label does not have an Integration attached.
- Made it easier to access existing Integrations.

Other:

- Added ability to sort Labels on the Label index page.
- Handle ADRAckReq flag even when Allow ADR is false.
- Included internal metrics for early alerts related to blockchain issues

### Fixes

- Users no longer need to need to scroll through the entire list of events when expanded all.
- Downlink no longer shows an error if two or more integrations are attached.
- HTTP integration works even if “&” inside of URL.
- Reduced the number of warnings during the open-source build to avoid confusion.
- Console logs out at session expiration.

### Open source users

- New users use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to quickly update Console/Router to the newest version which
  includes the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth operations. To update, check the
  newest instructions, rebuild, and restart. The database is not affected.
