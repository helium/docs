The team has a new release tagged `2021.04.26.1` which contains some new features and bug fixes.
This is a _required_ upgrade for all miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using the Helium
firmware when we GA. Specifically, this release includes support for Payment Memos which requires a
chain variable to activate and makes this a required release. We don't intend to activate this chain
variable for about a week. Please read further for more details.

### [miner#742](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/742): Update only snapshot to 819361

The team has updated only the snapshot block to `819361` for faster sync to the current blockchain
head block.

### [miner#737](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/737): Update dependencies and snapshot to 813601

The team updated miner dependencies and the snapshot block to `813601` to allow newly onboarded
hotspots to sync faster to the current blockchain head block.

### [miner#655](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/655): Update rebar to v3.14

As part of regular maintenance the team has updated the rebar version to 3.14 included in miner
repo.

### [blockchain-core#785](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/785): Better stacktrace for gossip handler crash

A minor change to allow better error messages when libp2p gossip handler crashes in blockchain-core.

### [blockchain-core#782](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/782): Fix for syncing blockchain-etl

Some members of the community reported that they had issues syncing blockchain-etl. The team found
the root cause to be an unnecessrary call to lookup the entire chain for previous
`blockchain_txn_poc_request`, this has been fixed to only start searching from the current ledger
height.

### [blockchain-core#768](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/768): Allow memo support for payment transactions

The team has enabled memo support for payment-v2 transactions. Note that the implementation is a bit
different than proposed in [HIP-26](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/125) in the sense that the
only memos the blockchain supports will be 64 bit unsigned integers.

### [blockchain-core#750](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/750): Sync performance improvements

The team updated the `blockchain_sync_handler` to try adding blocks in a spawned process so that
blocks will continue to be added if a connection drops during sync. This may improve sync times.

### [blockchain-core#743](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/743): Update rebar for blockchain

As part of regular maintenance the team has updated the rebar version to 3.14 included in
blockchain-core repo.

### [blockchain-core#733](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/733): Add aux-ledger support

The team added support for an auxiliary ledger to enable better testing of potential future chain
variables and new blockchain features. The aux ledger maintains a copy of the actual on-chain ledger
while allowing the team to test additional chain related changes.

### [erlang-libp2p#335](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/335): Manage the stungun timer better

This update adds a stungun timer reference to `libp2p_transport_tcp` module state and appropriately
handles it.

### [erlang-libp2p#334](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/334): Fix fdset race condition

This change fixes a race condition the team noticed in `libp2p_transport_tcp` module.

### [erlang-libp2p#333](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/333): Garbage collect unused processes

This change adds a process id garbage collection monitor to better handle stale processes in the
`libp2p_swarm_server`.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.04.26.1` since April 26th, 2021 12:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
4:00 PM PT, April 26th, 2021. We've been beta testing a prior version `2021.04.22.1` over the
weekend and updated just the snapshot today in order to improve initial sync times for new miners.
