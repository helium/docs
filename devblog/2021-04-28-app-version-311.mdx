# 3.1.1 Improvements and Bug Fixes

## Updated Hotspot UI

A modified Hotspot UI that allows for navigating to the next Hotspot in a list, without going back
to the Hotspot tab.

## Push Notifications opens to Notifications tab

Users will be directed to the Notifications tab when they receive an app push notification.

## Antenna Gain and Height Bug Fix

Fixed a bug where some users were unable to submit antenna gain and height unless they pressed Enter
before Submit. This is fixed.

## Pin Updates

Added an explicit "Sign Out" label on the PIN page to avoid accidentally signing out while pressing
Cancel.

# Known Issues

Some users may see an empty Notifications tab after initiating the app. This will be fixed in 3.1.2,
and the work around is to wait a few more seconds or leave the Notifications tab and come back.
