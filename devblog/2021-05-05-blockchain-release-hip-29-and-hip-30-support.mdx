The team has a new release tagged `2021.05.04.2` which adds support for
[HIP-29](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0029-multisignature-keys.md),
[HIP-30](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0030-update-threshold-cryptography.md), and
various bug fixes. This is a _required_ upgrade for all miners and will be automatic for all
Hotspots using the Helium firmware when we GA.

### [miner#757](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/757): Switch to threshold cryptography

As mentioned in HIP-30, this adds support for [erlang-tc](https://github.com/helium/erlang-tc) in
miner to start using BLS12-381 keys for HoneyBadgerBFT consensus and DKG.

### [miner#756](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/756): Update blockchain-core and snapshot to 830161

The team updated miner dependencies and the snapshot block to `830161` to allow newly onboarded
hotspots to sync faster to the current blockchain head block.

### [miner#755](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/755): Make print_keys independent of running miner

This fixes the `miner print_keys` CLI to avoid a trailing `ok` and removes a hardcoded path
dependency.

### [blockchain-core#793](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/792): Fix to_json for payment-v2 memos

The team noticed that previously added memo support for payment_v2 transactions was not updating the
JSON for use in the API correctly. This has been fixed.

### [hbbft#66](https://github.com/helium/erlang-hbbft/pull/66): Add support for threshold cryptography

As mentioned in HIP-30, this adds support for running the HoneyBadgerBFT protocol over the BLS12-381
curve to generate ephemeral keys used by the consensus group to make blocks.

### [dkg#36](https://github.com/helium/erlang-dkg/pull/36): Add support for threshold cryptography

As mentioned in HIP-30, this adds support for running the distributed key generation protocol over
the BLS12-381 curve to generate ephemeral keys used by the consensus group to make blocks.

### [libp2p-crypto#10](https://github.com/helium/libp2p-crypto/pull/10): Multisig support

As mentioned in HIP-29, this adds support for multi-signature keys.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.04.2` since May 4th, 2021 5:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is 1:00
PM PT, May 5th, 2021.
