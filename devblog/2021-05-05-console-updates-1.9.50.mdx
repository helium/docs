This sprint the team focused on Integration updates including building a Google Sheets prebuilt
Integration, adding dynamic query parameters, and including a hold_time field to increase accuracy
of timestamps.

<!--truncate-->

### Features and updates

- Added a prebuilt integration for Google Sheets. This requires: setting up a public Google form,
  preparing a script to decode the payload, and setting up integration on Console. See
  [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/integrations/google-sheets) for
  instructions.
- Enhanced HTTP Integration with dynamic query parameters allowed in endpoint.
- Increase accuracy of timestamps, we’ve included hold_time (default 0) which represents the time
  that a Hotspot was holding on to a packet (in milliseconds). The holding time can be due to
  multiple reasons such as: time between offer and acceptance of packet or if communication between
  Console/Router and Hotspots is slow then Hotspots would hold on to packets until communication is
  restored. This feature will be activated when Hotspots have been updated.
- Functions page includes an Integrations column that lists Integrations.
- Downlink queued item no longer appears after downlink has been sent, and only displays a single
  item even if multiple integrations.
- Added a legend to real time packets view.

### Fixes

- Backend work to accelerate packet ingestion from Hotspots.
- Payment options for Automatic Renewals no longer appear if a payment method hasn’t been defined.
- Spaces in custom scripts no longer cause Functions Decoder to fail.
- Updated real time packets to align with legend.

### Open source users

- New users use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to quickly update Console/Router to the newest version which
  includes the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth operations. To update, check the
  newest instructions, rebuild, and restart. The database is not affected.

### Upcoming

The team’s focus in the coming weeks (usual disclaimers apply):

- Include downlink MAC command info
- Discovery mode support for Hotspot new feature
- Provide docs to help monitor open source Console
- Create a module to integrate with other LoRaWAN network servers, initially ChirpStack.
- Update Console core design based on Flows (beta) feedback
