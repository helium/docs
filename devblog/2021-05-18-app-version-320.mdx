# Discovery Mode is Here!

Use Discovery Mode to understand your Hotspotâ€™s coverage without waiting for
Proof-of-Coverage/Beacons, or setting a location!

<!--truncate-->

Your Hotspot acts as a device and sends out radio packets for a short period of time, and any
Hotspots that heard the packet will respond.

How can you use Discovery Mode?

- use it to compare antennas (is one better than the other?)
- use it to test indoor or outdoor set ups
- test if higher really is better (it is)
- which side of the house sees more Hotspots?

Run Discovery Mode up to 5 times per day per Hotspot.

Note: Discovery Mode will not work on syncing Hotspots, offline Hotspots, and may not work on
Relayed Hotspots. Discovery Mode is free to use until further notice.

Try it out today - update to app version 3.2.0 and make sure your Hotspot is running firmware
2021.05.12.0.

## Other Bug fixes

Transfer Hotspot bug is now fixed where users were unable to tap on the button in the Transfer
Hotspot notification.
