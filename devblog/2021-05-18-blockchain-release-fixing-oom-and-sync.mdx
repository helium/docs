The team has a new release tagged `2021.05.18.0` which primarily fixes out-of-memory and sync issues
observed on older, less capable hardware, and other bug fixes. This is a _required_ upgrade for all
miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using the Helium firmware when we GA.

<!--truncate-->

### [miner#776](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/776): Update blockchain-core and downgrade snapshot

The current blessed snapshot was downgraded back to `845281` because the previously blessed snapshot
was incomplete. Hotspots that have tried to load the new, bad snapshot will be stuck until a newer,
complete snapshot is minted by the chain.

### [miner#766](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/766): Add arm64 image builder

An ARM64 docker image builder was added to avoid long running build times.

### [blockchain-core#807](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/807): Parameterize snapshot generation

The change makes snapshot generation to be dependent on the currently configured
`poc_challenge_interval` chain variable. This limits snapshot generation to only those that include
required blocks as set by this variable.

### [blockchain-core#806](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/806): Clean checkpoint bugs and fix subnets

A few bugs related to ledger checkpoints were addressed and failing tests were fixed.

### [blockchain-core#805](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/805): Add missing light gateway chain var validation

A few missing chain variable validation functions were added after testing Light Hotspots on the
Testnet.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.18.0` since May 18th, 2021 4:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
10:00 PM PT, May 18th, 2021.
