The team has a new release tagged `2021.05.19.0` which primarily fixes low space observed on some
Hotspots with smaller SD cards and updates the blessed snapshot. This is a _required_ upgrade for
all miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using the Helium firmware when we GA.

### [miner#781](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/781): Update snapshot to 851041

After
[yesterday's](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2021/05/18/blockchain-release-fixing-oom-and-sync.html)
stability fix release the chain was successfully able to mint a new, complete snapshot `851041`. The
team has updated miner config to switch to the newer blessed snapshot for newly onboarded Hotspots
to sync faster.

The fix for low space Hotspots is baked in the firmware of the Hotspots itself, simply removing
previously created database directories if the storage usage is above 90% and recreating the
required database directories from the newest blessed snapshot specified in miner config.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.19.0` since May 19th, 2021 4:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is 6:00
PM PT, May 19th, 2021.
