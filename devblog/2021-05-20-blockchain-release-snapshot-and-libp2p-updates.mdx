The core developers have tagged a new `2021.05.20.0` Hotspot firmware release which primarily fixes
libp2p peerbook issues affecting a small number of Hotspots and also updates the blessed snapshot.
This is a _required_ upgrade for all miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using the Helium
firmware when we GA.

This change updates the `blockchain-core` dependency as described below and a new blessed snapshot
`852481` has been added for newly onboarded Hotspots to sync faster.

### [erlang-libp2p#341](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p/pull/341): Clear peerbook if it's not corrupted

An error case in RocksDB opening while getting the libp2p peerbook has been addressed.
