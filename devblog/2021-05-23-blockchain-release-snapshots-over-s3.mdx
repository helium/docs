The core developers have tagged a new `2021.05.22.0` Hotspot firmware release which adds S3 download
functionality for snapshots and updates the blessed snapshot to `855361`. This is an optional, but
recommended upgrade for all miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using the Helium firmware
when we GA.

### [blockchain-core#810](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/810): Pull snapshots from S3

This change allows blockchain participants to attempt to download a snapshot file from S3 and
install it. If that fails, it will fall back to the current code path. Additionally, it exposes a
CLI interface to attempt to grab a snapshot from the p2p code path and save it to a specified file.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.22.0` since May 22nd, 2021 5:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
12:30 PM PT, May 23rd, 2021.
