The core developers have tagged a new `2021.05.24.1` Hotspot firmware release which changes S3
snapshot download timeout to a more relaxed limit and updates the blessed snapshot to `858241`. This
is an optional, but recommended upgrade for all miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using
the Helium firmware when we GA.

<!--truncate-->

### [miner#786](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/786): Bump snapshot to 858241 and update blockchain-core

This change updates the latest blessed snapshot to `858241` and updates blockchain-core dependency
to pick up snapshot timeout fixes.

### [miner#784](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/784): Fix bash script for GA docker tags

This change fixes a misconfigured match statement which was previously preventing trigger docker
builds whenever the team would GA a new firmware tag.

### [blockchain-core#812](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/812): Increase snapshot download timeout

This change increases the snapshot download timeout limits set to more acceptable values.
Furthermore it handles a sentinel error value when importing snapshots.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.24.1` since May 24th, 2021 6:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is 9:00
PM PT, May 24th, 2021.
