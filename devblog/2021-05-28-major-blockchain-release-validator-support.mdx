The core developers have tagged a new `2021.05.28.0` Hotspot firmware release which prepares support
for [Validators](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0025-validators.md) on Mainnet. This is a
_required_ upgrade for all miners and will be automatic for all Hotspots using the Helium firmware
when we GA.

### [miner#795](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/795): Update blockchain-core dependency

A dependency bump to include resync fixes from blockchain-core.

### [miner#794](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/794): Update blockchain-core and new blessed snapshot

This change updates blockchain-core dependency and changes the blessed snapshot to `862561`.

### [miner#793](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/793): Update blockchain-core for Validator and AS923 support

This change updates blockchain-core depedency to include Validator support and updates AS923 LoraWAN
frequency channels.

### [miner#791](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/791): Relax timers on PoC related events

The team noticed that in certain scenarios when block production is slower than expected, the
Proof-of-Coverage related timers were too restrictive. This has been fixed.

### [miner#772](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/772): Update CSV for LoraWAN Spec RP002-1.0.3

Thanks to community member [@shawaj](https://github.com/shawaj) for adding this change which updates
the countries CSV list to newer LoraWAN Spec RP002-1.0.3 and fixes channel parameters for multiple
regions.

### [blockchain-core#832](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/832): Fix new ledger invocation

This change fixes some incorrect calls to invoke a new ledger when a new snapshot is loaded.

### [blockchain-core#831](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/831): Fix checkpoints for block handles

This fixes checkpoints (used for snapshots) to invoke a new ledger correctly.

### [blockchain-core#829](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/829): Fix poc_receipts eunit

The team noticed broken eunit tests in `blockchain_txn_poc_receipts_v1`, these have been fixed.

### [blockchain-core#727](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/727): Validator support

The team finally merged the highly anticipated support for Validators. Validators are a new entity
on the Helium Blockchain that will perform the work of the consensus group including verifying
transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. Validators improve the overall security, and
reliability of the network allowing it to continue its unprecendented growth.

**NOTE: We will have a separate post on the activation schedule.**

Once the validator related chain vars are activated on the network, users will be able to stake
validator nodes. After the threshold (100 validators on Mainnet) has been met we will choose a date
to activate validator nodes to start performing consensus group work and earning HNT rewards on
Mainnet. This activation date provides everyone an equal starting point to prepare and stake
validators.

Please feel free to read [HIP 25](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0025-validators.md), and
docs for more information on Validators.

This PR is also accompanied by a few smaller bug-fix PRs, notably:

- [blockchain-core#820](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/820): Bug fix for election-v5
- [blockchain-core#818](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/818): Add release height to
  Validator record
- [blockchain-core#817](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/817): Guarantee offline
  Validator removal

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.28.0` since May 28th, 2021 11:50 AM PT. Current ETA for GA is
5:00 PM PT, May 28th, 2021.
