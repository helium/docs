The core developers have prepared an emergency release `2021.05.29.0` to fix the Mainnet chain halt
noticed around 1:00 PM PST, May 29th, 2021. This is a **mandatory** release for all miners on the
network. Please read further for more details.

## What Happened?

The team changed the election_info API in `blockchain-core` as part of support for
[Validators](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2021/05/28/major-blockchain-release-validator-support.html)
but missed updating the relevant API calls in miner. Surprisingly `xref` and `dialyzer`, two tools
used in the Erlang ecosystem to do static analysis, didn't catch the incorrect calls either. This
regression led to a chain halt as the code change broke a critical HoneyBadgerBFT recovery code
path.

## Timeline

- **Sat May 29 01:04:00 PM PDT 2021**: The core team got a pagerduty alert that there were no new
  blocks after block `864000`
- **Sat May 29 01:26:00 PM PDT 2021**: [status](http://status.helium.com/) updated to reflect the
  blockchain halt and debugging.
- **Sat May 29 01:45:00 PM PDT 2021**: The bug was identified as an incorrect call in miner to a
  critical election related function in blockchain-core, more details available in
  [miner#797](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/797).
- **Sat May 29 02:00:00 PM PDT 2021**: `2021.05.29.0` release candidate prepared for beta testing
  and imminent GA.

The issue was identified addressed quickly and the Consensus Group will be able to continue block
production after this release.

## Future Work

Bugs like these can slip through normal reviews and testing but improved test suites with better
code coverage can help catch these sorts of regressions. Future regular maintenance releases will
include these improvments.

## Plan

We will begin beta testing `2021.05.29.0` as soon as the release is built and GA immediately after
checking beta status.
