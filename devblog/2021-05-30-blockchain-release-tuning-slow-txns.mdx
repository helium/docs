As some of the community has noticed, block times and elections have been struggling the last week
or so as the network continues to grow. The core developers have prepared the `2020.05.29.1` release
which will adjust validation times for two known slower transactions in our blockchain. This is an
optional but recommended release for miners on the network.

<!--truncate-->

Forcing receipts transaction validation to 100ms (from 125ms) and increasing validation time of the
consensus group transaction to 30s (from 10s) should improve block times between elections and make
a successful election more likely.

### [miner#798](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/798): Give more time to consensus groups and less to poc receipts

After
[yesterday's](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2021/05/29/blockchain-release-chain-halt-postmortem.html)
emergency release to fix blockchain halt, the core developers noticed that election transactions
were not getting enough time for validation and absorption, this PR updates the timeouts to help
clear longer election transactions.

## Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.05.29.1` since 11:00 PM PST 29th May, 2021 and will GA at 4:45 PM
PST May 30th, 2021.
