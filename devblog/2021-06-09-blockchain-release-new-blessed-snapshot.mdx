The core developers have tagged a new `2021.06.09.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains a newly
generated snapshot. This would allow newly onboarded and previously un-synced hotspots to sync to
the head of the blockchain much faster.

  Hotspots are always validating transactions and blocks unless in follow mode.
