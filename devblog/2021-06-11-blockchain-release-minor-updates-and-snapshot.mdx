The core developers have tagged a new `2021.06.11.2` Hotspot firmware release which has minor test
related fixes and a newly generated snapshot. This is an optional release for Hotspot owners but
recommended to get newly onboarded and/or un-synced hotspots to sync to the head of the blockchain.

Below are the related PRs:

- #### [miner#818](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/818): Update core and set blessed snap-879121

  This change updates `blockchain-core` dependency and supplies a newly blessed chain generated
  snapshot at height `879121`.

- #### [blockchain-core#861](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/861): Don't validate chain vars for genesis block

  This change allows the construction of genesis block without any chain var validation. Primarily
  used for testing.

- #### [blockchain-core#860](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/860): Don't download S3 snapshot if honor_quick_sync is false

  The core developers noticed that miner would continue to attempt to download S3 snapshot despite
  setting `honor_quick_sync` as false preventing debugging, this has been fixed.

- #### [blockchain-core#859](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/859): Diff more elements of snapshots

  This is a minor change to allow verification and debugging of ledger deviation when generating
  snapshots.
