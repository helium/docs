The core developers have tagged a new `2021.06.14.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains
transaction processing improvements, preparatory code for a new chain variable, and a newly
generated snapshot. This is a _required_ release for Hotspot owners. Further announcements will be
made for chain variable activation schedule but we expect about a week or so of time to allow
downstream clients of the chain (etl, node, and router users) to update.

Below are the related PRs:

- #### [miner#824](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/824): Update core and set blessed snap-882721

  This change updates `blockchain-core` dependency and supplies a newly blessed chain generated
  snapshot at height `882721`. Subsequent miner PRs are also listed below, please feel free to read
  through them for more details:

  - [miner#820](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/820): Transaction manager depedency test
    improvements
  - [miner#800](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/800): Add more transaction manager testing

- #### [blockchain-core#830](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/830): Ensure nonce is checked as part of transaction validation

  The Pull Request itself contains more details but this fix pulls most of the transaction
  validation code further up from "absorb" context into the "validation" context of a transaction's
  lifecycle. This should help classify invalid transactions earlier than the current blockchain
  behavior. This will also improve valid/invalid status in `blockchain-etl` which should result in
  better user experience for users of the API and App.

- #### [blockchain-core#863](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/863): Fix reward unit calculation

  The core developers would like to thank [@marcusze](https://github.com/marcusze) for reporting
  [blockchain-core#835](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/issues/835). The current reward
  distribution for Proof of Coverage beacons doesn't precisely conform with
  [HIP-15](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0015-beaconing-rewards.md) transmission reward
  unit, the changes here will address that.

  This change prepares the blockchain with a fix for the reported bug. It will be gated behind a
  chain variable which requires that all blockchain participants (hotspot, router, node, and etl)
  update to prevent a chain halt. We typically allow at least a week before issuing a new chain
  variable. Further notice will be sent for chain variable activation schedule.

- #### [blockchain-core#864](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/864): Fix deadlock when continuing to load snapshot

  The core developers noticed that some Hotspots would crash and not recover correctly when trying
  to ingest a snapshot, this fixes that. Please read the PR description for more details.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.06.14.0` since June 14th, 2021 5:00 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
1:30 PM PT, June 15th, 2021.
