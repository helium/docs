# App Release 3.3.0

Hexagons on the Helium Network

<!--truncate-->

We are introducing hexagons on the Helium network! We heard your feedback on how privacy is
important to all Hotspots owners, and we completely agree. This new release will represent your
Hotspot in a hexagon instead of a precise location.

With this, we also introduce map filters: your owned and followed Hotspots, witnesses, and transmit
scale.

## Improvements:

Hotspot Onboarding list now has a filter function to quickly get to the Hotspot Maker you need.

Understand Scaling - tap on the Transmit Scale number to read our help guide.

Witness List

- Instead of showing average witnesses (that refreshes too frequent to be useful in any context), we
  show a list of Hotspots that have witnessed your beacon based on proof-of-coverage receipts, over
  the last 5 days.
