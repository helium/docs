The core developers have tagged a new `2021.06.25.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains updates
to support better transaction validation for Validators and improvements to State Channel
scalability. This is a _required_ release for Hotspot owners as it introduces new chain variables
which will get activated at a later date.

- #### Miner Updates

  This miner release includes Validator and JSON RPC support. Please feel free to read validator
  docs and browse through the PRs listed below for further details:

  - [miner#804](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/804): JSON RPC support

- #### Blockchain Updates

  The core developers have added support for a new chain variable `validator_key_check` to guard
  `blockchain_txn_stake_validator_v1` and `blockchain_txn_transfer_validator_stake_v1` against using
  keys from the wrong network.

- ##### State Channel Improvements

  The core developers have updated state channels to be more scalable as the network grows by
  introducing a new `sc_max_actors` chain variable and allowing validation of more than `10`
  simultaneous state channels.

  - [blockchain-core#852](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/852): Fix state channel
    server to allow more state channels and overspill

  upgrades when ingesting snapshots and transaction manager fixes. Related PRs are listed below:
