The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.11.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains
performance improvements to snapshot ingestion. This is an _optional_ but _highly_ recommended
release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers especially for those Hotspots which are based on older
Raspberry Pi3 hardware.
