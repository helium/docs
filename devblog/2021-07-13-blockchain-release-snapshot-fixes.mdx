The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.13.1` Hotspot firmware release which contains
snapshot ingestion improvements and a newly blessed snapshot. This is a _mandatory_ release for
Hotspot owners and manufacturers to continue syncing with newly blessed snapshots.

<!--truncate-->

This release contains a much newer snapshot for block height 920126, and follows on the emergency
release on the weekend to make it even easier for older Hotspots to sync by eliminating some
time-consuming and unnecessary work. It also fixes a bug in snapshot loading that caused some
Hotspots that loaded the last snap to halt and stop syncing. Finally, this release fixes a rare
issue with restarting that can cause some Hotspots to halt until a corrupted cache file was manually
deleted.
