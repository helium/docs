# App Release 3.4.0

## New Features

3.4.0 Includes a small facelift to our Wallet and Hotspot tabs!

<!--truncate-->

Hotspot Tab

- We have introduced a new shortcut navigation menu that allows you to quickly swipe through all the
  Hotspots you own and follow

Wallet Tab

- Updated UI layout on Wallet tab with new send and receive icons, easier QR code discoverability,
  and a filter for transaction types
- If you’ve staked Validators, we now show the staked amount

## Improvements

- Improve how we calculate a Hotspot’s sync status by using the last gossiped timestamp to API
  instead of gossiped block through the p2p network
- Inform users that Discovery Mode results may be inconsistent
- Update hexagon colors for accessibility

## Bug Fixes

- When asserting a location, check that the location actually changed
- Fix a bug when scanning QR code for payments with varying formats
- Fix a bug with the default email address when sharing from Diagnostic Reports

## Known Issue

- Hotspot Checklist > Sync Status is showing incorrect data. We’ll be fixing this in 3.4.1.
