The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.15.0` Hotspot firmware release which introduces more
snapshot related fixes. This is a _mandatory_ release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers to
continue syncing with newly blessed snapshots.

<!--truncate-->

This release improves on the
[previous](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2021/07/13/blockchain-release-snapshot-fixes.html)
release and fixes some critical issues related to light gateway support, snapshot disagreement and
non-invalidation (follow) mode. As many community members have noticed, there hasn't been a blessed
snapshot on the blockchain for a while, the core developers believe that the fixes in this new
release will further improve chances of getting a snapshot on chain.
