This release the team worked on addressing issues reported for Console 2.0 beta and also backend
fixes to make joins and packet transfer more reliable.

<!--truncate-->

### Join and uplink issues

A number of issues have impacted joins and uplinks over the past few weeks. Here’s a list of updates
made to address these issues as well as upcoming fixes.

Hotspot syncing - an issue causing earlier versions of Hotspots to continually sync, which could
have impacted packet delivery was fixed
[blog](https://engineering.helium.comhttps://docs.helium.com/blog/2021/07/11/blockchain-release-snapshot-performance-update.html)

State channels - increased the maximum number of open state channels to 10 (from 5) which helps
Console backend (Router) serve more packets as the demand on using the network continues to
increase. For more information about state channels and their role check
[here](https://blog.helium.com/helium-state-channels-383ade2368d0)

Channel frequency list (CFlist)- this feature was enabled according to feedback from the community,
however it was discovered to cause issues if device firmware did not closely adhere to the LoRaWAN
spec. Based on community feedback we’ve included a toggle to enable it, but disabled it by default.

XOR filter - to help scale in an upcoming release we are updating the production Console/Router to
use an xor filter. This will allow the backend to only process known traffic and avoid spending
resources on unfamiliar packets. More information about xor filters
[here](https://docs.helium.com/lorawan-on-helium/#join-request-frames-and-filters).

### Features and fixes

- Updates to Console 2.0 beta on staging server based on feedback.
  - Staging UI: Icons without text descriptions of their actions

  - Staging UI Tweeks: Device Name [677](https://github.com/helium/console/issues/677)
- Provided a new Label setting to enable CFList for supported devices US915 (default off).
- Opening device detail in new tab has strange behavior
  [653](https://github.com/helium/console/issues/653)
- Provide a backend cache to help address late packets

### Open source users

- New users should use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to quickly update Console/Router to the newest version which
  includes the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth operations.
  - To update, check the newest instructions, rebuild, and restart. The database is not affected.
  - Libressl-dev has been swapped with openssl-dev in the Dockerfile dependencies list. This simply
    requires a rebuild.
  - If you experience issues running Console/Router locally, update Docker to the latest version and
    pick up the changes in docker-compose-local.yaml
