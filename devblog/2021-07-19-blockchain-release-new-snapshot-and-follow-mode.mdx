The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.19.0` Hotspot firmware release which updates the
currently blessed snapshot, introduces state channel related improvements and switches all Hotspots
to non-validation (follow mode). This is an optional but _recommended_ release for Hotspot owners
and manufacturers to continue syncing with newly blessed snapshots.
