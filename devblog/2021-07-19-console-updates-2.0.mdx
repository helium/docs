After many months of work and testing based on community feedback, the team plans to release Console
2.0 on Thursday 7/29.

<!--truncate-->

There will be two major changes to Console with the release of 2.0:

- The new Flows feature which you can read about more
  [here](https://blog.helium.com/console-2-0-beta-test-and-earn-swag-ee366734779).

- Using the xor filter to add devices to the blockchain.

During the release of Console 2.0 to production on 7/29, there’s a planned maintenance period from
10 am to 12 pm PDT. Despite the Console interface being inaccessible during this time, devices will
continue to send data.

**XOR filter = improved performance**

As network usage increases, the XOR filter allows the Console backend (router) to only process known
traffic and avoid spending resources on unfamiliar packets, which significantly improves
performance.

However, the 1st time a device joins the network its keys need to be added to the blockchain and the
updated block propagated to the miners (Hotspots).

This initial join process could take up to 15 mins depending on:

- when this transaction (batched with others) gets added to the blockchain
- the overall performance of the blockchain

**What do I need to do?**

There’s no action required. Your devices and configurations will be preserved and you won’t need to
take any action. In addition, your Data Credit balances will remain unchanged.

Before release, you can test devices and integrations at Console 2.0 beta
[here](https://staging-console.helium.wtf/).

1. Devices can only be in one Console organization. In other words, you can't use the same device
   that's currently in another Organization.

2. Make sure you're only logged into one Console instance at a time (for example, if you’re testing
   on Console 2.0 beta, don’t also have a production Console instance open).

3. Console 2.0 beta uses the xor filter, so devices added for the 1st time could take up to 15
   minutes.

Thanks again for your support.

The Console team
