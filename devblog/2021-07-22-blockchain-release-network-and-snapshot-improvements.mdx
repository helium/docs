The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.22.0` Hotspot firmware release which updates the
currently blessed snapshot and contains networking and snapshot improvements. This is an optional
but _recommended_ release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers to continue syncing with newly
blessed snapshots.
