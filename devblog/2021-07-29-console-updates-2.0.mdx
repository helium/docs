After many months of work and testing based on community feedback, the team is excited to announce
the official release of Console 2.0! The team not only worked on new features and capabilities, but
also focused on making sure migration to Console 2.0 would be seamless for existing users.

<!--truncate-->

The two major changes to Console with the release of 2.0 are the Flows feature and the use of the
XOR filter.

### Flows

Flows makes it easy for users to transfer data from devices to endpoints by providing a
visual-centric view of the key elements: devices, functions, and integrations. No more reliance on
Labels to act as the superglue, on the Flows workspace devices directly connect to function or
integrations. Labels are soley used to group devices for better organization allowing flexibility as
your projects scale and grow.

### XOR Filter

The XOR filter allows the Console back-end, Router, to only process known traffic which will
significantly improve performance by allowing Router to avoid spending resources on unfamiliar
packets.

**Important: The first time a device joins the Network, its keys need to be added to the blockchain
and the updated block propagated to the miners (Hotspots) and this initial join process could take
up to 20 mins depending on:**

- When this transaction (batched with others) gets added to the Helium blockchain
- The overall performance of the blockchain

### XOR Filter Details

The device attempts a new join via XOR filter associated with the paired OUI. The OUI includes a set
of devaddrs that will be assigned to newly joined devices (note these devaddrs do not need to be
unique for each device, the combination of application key is used to avoid conflicts).

New devices are assigned to a devaddr which are handed out based on the OUI. The `app_eui`, and
`dev_eui` are added to the XOR filter which is then written to the blockchain (added to a block and
propagated to miners). This process could take up to 20 mins.

Gateways use device `app_eui`, `dev_eui` to query the blockchain via xor filter to identify which
OUI to send join packets.

Router which belongs to OUI receives join request, sends down a join accept, and assigns the
NwkAddr.

For future uplinks, gateways use a device’s devaddr to identify which router/oui to send to which is
significantly quicker.

### Features and fixes

- Continued optimization with state channels to improve performance including increasing the number
  of actors per state channel.
- Device 'Last Modified' date shows current date/time
  [707](https://github.com/helium/console/issues/707).
- Missing Device name, EUI & other info in Group
  [704](https://github.com/helium/console/issues/704).
- Make Initial organization dc balance as a parameter
  [683](https://github.com/helium/console/issues/683).
- Staging UI Tweaks: Device Name [677](https://github.com/helium/console/issues/677).

### Open source users

- New users should use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to quickly update Console/Router to the newest version which
  includes the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth operations.

### Migrating Devices from Staging to Production Console

For users migrating devices from staging to production, perform the following:

1. Deactivate device(s) on staging (can do individually or from the Organization section can
   deactivate all).
2. Add device on production Console.
3. Wait up to 20 mins for device to get added to production.
4. After confirmation device is functioning as expected, delete device on staging.

### Upcoming

The team’s focus in the coming weeks (usual disclaimers apply):

- Gateway monitoring
- Microsoft Azure IoT Hub pre-built Integration
- Support AS923 for Australia
- Packet purchaser: integrate with ChirpStack LoRaWAN Network Server
