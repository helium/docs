The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.29.0` Hotspot firmware release which updates the
currently blessed snapshot, adds a new seed node to the statically configured list, adjusts address
hashing for Hotspot identification, and contains minor bug fixes. This is an optional but
_recommended_ release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers to continue syncing with newly blessed
snapshots.
