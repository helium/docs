The core developers have tagged a new `2021.07.30.0` Hotspot firmware release which updates the
currently blessed snapshot, fixes a minor bug in snapshot downloads from the Amazon S3 source, and a
community contribution from [@PaulVMo](https://github.com/PaulVMo) that improves libp2p
identification of private IP addresses. This is an optional but _recommended_ release for Hotspot
owners and manufacturers to continue syncing with newly blessed snapshots.
