The core developers have tagged a new `2021.08.02.0` Hotspot firmware release which updates the
currently blessed snapshot and handles IPv6 addresses in bogon check. This release also removes the
default Helium production router from the static configuration to help meet the demands on
utilization on the network

<!--truncate-->

This is an optional but _recommended_ release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers to continue
syncing with newly blessed snapshots.
