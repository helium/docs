The core developers have tagged a new `2021.08.05.0` Hotspot firmware release which updates the
currently blessed snapshot and includes some fixes for state channel handling for packet routing.
The release also includes support for fetching more seed nodes from DNS and some fixes for other
applications using blockchain-core (router and ETL).

<!--truncate-->

This is an optional but _recommended_ release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers to continue
syncing with newly blessed snapshots. We also believe this release will improve an issue with
'bursting' packets on router that has been observed.
