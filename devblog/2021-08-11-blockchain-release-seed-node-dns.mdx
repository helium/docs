The core developers have tagged a new `2021.08.11.0` Hotspot firmware release which allows a new way
to fetch seed nodes from DNS, updates the currently blessed snapshot, and contains a few other small
fixes

<!--truncate-->

This is an optional but _recommended_ release for Hotspot owners and manufacturers to continue
syncing with newly blessed snapshots.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.08.11.0` since Aug 10th, 2021 3:30 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
11:30 AM PT, Aug 11th, 2021.

### Update

The core developers noticed that the above release was incompatible with the way connectedness is
reported in Hotspot Diagnostic Reports. We have been testing `2021.08.11.2` that reverts these
changes since 5:30 PM PT, Aug 11th, 2021 and will GA immediately. We recommend that other Hotspot
manufacturers deploy this version of the miner code base instead.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
