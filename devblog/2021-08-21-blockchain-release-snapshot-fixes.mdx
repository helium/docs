The core developers have tagged a new `2021.08.21.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains major
blockchain-core updates specifically ensuring that snapshots are correctly getting loaded.
Furthermore this release supplies a new snapshot to allow new and un-synced hotspots to continue
syncing. This is _mandatory_ release for all hotspot manufacturers.
