The core developers have tagged a new `2021.09.03.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains a
snapshot update. Please note that this tag is based off of `2021.08.31.1` and not on miner master as
the team wants to continue testing PoCv11 changes that landed on master yesterday.

<!--truncate-->

This is an _optional_, but recommended, release for all hotspot manufacturers to help catch up their
respective fleets to the latest block.
