A major feature the team’s worked on for the last two sprints is Coverage. Unlike Hotspot monitoring
tools focused on maximizing mining rewards, Coverage is built for users of the network who want to
have more visibility about which Hotspots are transferring device packets as well as displaying the
status of those Hotspots all from within Console.

### Features and fixes

- Coverage: identify which Hotspots are transferring packets, view Hotspot status, and display
  packet transfer data all from within Console. For more details go
  [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/coverage/).
- Added label back to metadata transferred with payloads.
- Added `hold_time` to debug mode. `Hold_time` provides useful information for Console users to
  identify if a Hotspot was holding on to a packet (in milliseconds).
- Provide capability to dedupe packets in the Packet Purchaser.
- Removed the default devaddr as it was no longer relevant.

### Open source users

- New users should use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to quickly update Console/Router to the newest version which
  includes the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth operations.
