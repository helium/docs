The core developers have tagged a new `2021.09.14.0` Hotspot firmware release which contains several
updates including support for PoCv11 (not yet activated), updates to snapshot loading, several
libp2p and rewards performance changes.

<!--truncate-->

This is a required release for all hotspot manufacturers as it contains a few chain variable
dependent code changes that will be released after a two week period of testing for regressions.

### Proof of Coverage v11 Support

This release includes support for the update to Proof of Coverage system. This upgrade will be
further described in a blog post later this week but this release allows developers to begin testing
chain variables using the auxiliary ledger. No action is required by Hotspot owners at this time.

### PoC Address Hash Update

The core developers have removed a stray change that caused address hashes to be calculated on the
/24 octet of a Challenger's IP address. This may have an impact on PoC Rate that the community
should continue to monitor. Thanks [@ci-work](https://github.com/ci-work)!

### PoC Random Witness Selection

This release also includes a randomization function for witness collection. After this release, a
_random subset_ of witnesses will be reported back to the chain, rather than the _fastest_ witness.
This should provide more diversity of witness information and allow developers to reduce the number
of total witnesses to `10` from the current value of `25`. This reduction (a chain variable that
will be released later today) should help improve performance of PoC and the blockchain as a whole.

### AU915 Channel Plan Update

This release removes a 500KHz channel from the AU915 channel plan. This was mistakenly added in a
prior release.

### Networking Improvements

This release also includes two networking improvements that should help Hotspots report the correct
IP address to other blockchain participants. It also introduces a new configuration setting for
makers:

```erl
{libp2p, {ip_confirmation_host, "https://ifconfig.co"}}
```

This configuration uses the ifconfig service to programmatically verify the Hotspot's IP address.
Makers may choose to update the endpoint to one that fits their customer's needs.

### Snapshot Updates

This release fixes some issues with snapshot loading, specifically with a Net Emissions related
variable that was causing snapshot loading to fail and download cleanup issue that was leaving large
partial downloads on disk.
