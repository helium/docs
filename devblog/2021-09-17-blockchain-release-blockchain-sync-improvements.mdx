The core developers have tagged a new `2021.09.16.1` Hotspot firmware release which primarily
includes performance improvements for Hotspots. You can read about them below. This release also
updates the blessed snapshot to `1012321`.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **required** release for all hotspot manufacturers and we recommend especially those with
Raspberry PI 3 or similar hardware to upgrade quickly. See the note below on Snapshot changes for
more details on why this is a required release.

### Improvements to Block Absorption / Chain Sync

The root cause for blockchain sync issues in the past few weeks have been due to the size of the
network and Hotspots with weaker hardware not being able to absorb blocks fast enough to keep up
with the chain. This release should help OG Helium Hotspots, Bobcats, Nebras, and other similar
hardware.

**Your Hotspot will need to be fully synced before PoC activity resumes and you are again able to
earn HNT for providing coverage.**

### Changes to Snapshots

An important note for manufacturers and "fast sync" features. Snapshots generated by Validators and
Hotspots after this release (`1.3.3` and `2021.09.16.1`, respectively) will not work on older
Hotspots. Please plan accordingly with snapshot generation.

In addition, miners (and other participants that are in "follow-mode") will no longer generate
snapshots. This should help reduce spikes in memory and CPU utilization when miners are generating
snapshots. This is no longer needed on Hotspots as Validators are responsible for generating
snapshots for the chain.

### Various Bugfixes

This release also includes some bugfixes around region lookups, a discovery mode bug (thanks
[@maco2035](https://github.com/maco2035) for finding and [@ke6jjj](https://github.com/ke6jjj)), and
prepares dependencies for a future Erlang/OTP 24 upgrade.
