The core developers have tagged a new `2021.09.26.0` Hotspot firmware release which primarily
includes networking, PoCv11 and transaction manager bug fixes. It also includes a new core developer
blessed snapshot at height `1024971` while we wait for the validator pool to update to version
`1.3.3`.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **required** release for all Hotspot manufacturers as it contains bug fixes for (currently
inactive) PoCv11 code.

### Networking Improvements

A crash bug in the logic for deciding when to use a relay address has been fixed. This may help
hotspots in certain configurations establish more stable networking.

### Transaction Protocol v2

This release introduces an update to the transaction protocol that takes into account what height
the consensus member rejected a transaction at. This is intended to help with cases of a transaction
that is marked as rejected and then clears, especially for wallet transactions.

### PoCv11 Bug Fixes

We've identified a few bugfixes to PoCv11 code. As this code is inactive, it shouldn't have any
impact on running Hotspots but are required for the impending release of PoCv11.
