The core developers have tagged a new `2021.09.27.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes some
performance fixes and a bug fix to block sync. It also includes a new core developer blessed
snapshot at height `1029491`. We've identified the cause of lack of agreements on on-chain snapshots
and have issued a fix for it as well but this will require a validator release.

This is a **optional** update for manufacturers.
