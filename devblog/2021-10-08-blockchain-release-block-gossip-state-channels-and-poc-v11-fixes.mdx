The core developers have tagged a new `2021.10.07.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes several
updates.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **mandatory** update for manufacturers as it contains updates to PoCv11 code that will be
required when we are ready to activate those chain variables and updates to how we will be doing
block gossip in the near future.

## Improvements to Hotspot bandwidth utilization and Block Gossip

We have found that as the network expands, bandwidth expectations of individual Hotspots have gone
up significantly and want to address this sooner than the Light Hotspot code is available. This
release includes preparatory work to enable lower bandwidth gossip. Details are available in the PR
listed below but at a high level, this change introduces a new protocol to gossip that dramatically
reduces bandwidth utilization.

## Critical Bug Fixes in PoCv11 and others

This release also fixes critical bugs that would prevent activation of PoCv11. Once this blockchain
release is on all Hotpots, Validators, ETLs, Routers and Node operators, we believe we can safely
activate PoCv11.

## Improvements to Witness Decay Rate Implementation

Although this implementation is not active, we found a few bugs and improvements to the
implementation of witness decay rate that could be activated through a HIP and community process to
address gaming via over-witnessing. This release updates the implementation to add a threshold and
fix some bugs found through review.

## Transfer Hotspot v2 Support

This release also adds support for the new `transfer_hotspot_v2` transaction. This transaction
removes the requirement of the recipient signature and removes the atomic transfer of HNT with the
transfer. The latter feature has been used by a small fraction of total Hotspot transfers. We have
also found that the implementation of requiring a recipient signature requires a centralized
coordination service which we believe should be removed in the network. This implementation is
behind a chain variable that will need to be activated once all blockchain participants have a
chance to upgrade to this release.

## Snapshot update, Other Bug Fixes and additional OTP-24 support

This release also addresses other miscellaneous bugs found in the past few weeks and updates the
snapshot height to `1042510`. It also adds additional support for Erlang/OTP 24 which should allow
all blockchain participants to upgrade.
