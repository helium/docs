The core developers have tagged a new `2021.10.18.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes some
bug fixes and a new blessed snapshot at height `1059841`. This release addresses a channel selection
bug causing unnecessary incorrect witnesses and fixes a potential race condition when initializing
`var-cache`. Furthermore, the updated `blockchain-core` has improved state channel support for
router.

This is an **optional** but recommended update for manufacturers to get the latest blessed on-chain
snapshots for faster hotspot syncing. This also addresses the "invalid channel" errors that some
hotspots were seeing.
