Included in this sprint, the team delivered Configuration Profiles provides users with a streamlined
way to configure, save, and apply device settings (ADR, CF List) and a new authentication system.

<!--truncate-->

Previous logins will be migrated to the new system and device settings (ADR, and CF List) will be
preserved.

**_Important Login Action Required_**

_The first time logging into Console after the upgrade every user will need to login twice, once to
migrate their account and then another time to login to Console as usual._
