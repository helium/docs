The core developers have tagged a new `2021.10.27.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes new
functionality for Hotspots to automatically ingest latest on-chain snapshots. **Makers, please see
the note below** as there are some updates you'll need to incorporate to use this feature. This
release also reverts the `var cache` which was causing unforeseen issues and upgrades
`blockchain-core` to include many State Channel related optimizations.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **mandatory** update for manufacturers to automatically ingest snapshots. We will no
longer be blessing snapshots manually after this update.

## Snapshot Source

This feature replaces the older snapshot loading mechanism and allows manufacturers to provide a
JSON file that is always used to load latest snapshots. Here is
[an example](https://snapshots.helium.wtf/mainnet/latest-snap.json) of a file the core team uses to
update our firmware controlled Hotspots.

This allows the hotspot to look for a file named `snap-1072801` .This will enable Hotspots to
automatically load the latest defined snapshot (without a firmware update). Blessed snapshots are
still used in case this URL is not available. These endpoints can be configured with the new config
variables listed [here](https://github.com/helium/miner/blob/master/config/sys.config#L45-L46),
specifically `snap_source_base_url` and `fetch_latest_from_snap_source`. If you, as maker, have a
custom `sys.config` or override file, you **must** update these configuration settings.
