The core developers have tagged a new `2021.10.29.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes bug
fixes for dropped packets reported by the community and verified by the router team.

<!--truncate-->

Devices attempting to join would continue in a join accept and request loop or devices trying to
downlink would be unsuccessful. This issue did not impact existing devices sending uplink packets.

This is a **mandatory** update for manufacturers as it includes other necessary fixes from
`2021.10.27.0`. If a manufacturer hasn't updated to `2021.10.27.0`, they should skip that build and
simply update to `2021.10.29.0`. The `2021.10.29.0` release will allow Hotspots to continue to route
LoRaWAN packets. The core developers apologize for creating urgent weekend work.
