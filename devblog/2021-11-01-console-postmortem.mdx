On 10/27 a fix based on a community-raised issue was deployed along with a number of other updates
in the `2021.10.27.0` Hotspot firmware release.

<!--truncate-->

The firmware update included related PR `miner#1136` which caused timing issues that resulted in
perpetual join accept and requests, and impacted downlinks.

- [PR](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/1136)

This issue only affected devices attempting joins or downlinks. Devices sending uplinks were not
affected.

An emergency update `2021.10.29.0` was pushed on 10/29 afternoon to miners/hotspots to fix the
issue. Read

## Next Steps

To increase the robustness of the network and prevent a similar issue from reoccurring the team
agreed upon the following next steps.

### More focused releases

- Focus on targeted releases which address related items vs just opportunistically adding unrelated
  items.

### More scrutiny for issues raised

Request clarity from community for relevant issues by asking members up front to include additional
context to answer the following:

    - What’s the problem that needs fixed or the opportunity for this feature?
    - Define the success criteria to test in the field to make sure it’s fixed or working.

### More canaries

- Broaden beta Hotspot test environment to include more canaries (hardware devices connected to beta
  Hotspot test groups).
- Add automated network side black-box testing to verify devices continue to operate as expected
  after beta Hotspots updated.
