The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.02.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes two
critical blockchain-core fixes, firstly, blockchain core can now handle v1 and v2 block gossip
seamlessly; secondly, the developers noticed that the `transaction_validity_version` chain variable
definition was set incorrectly in the header file, this has been fixed. An unfortunate effect of
this is that `transfer_hotspot_v2` support has been slightly delayed.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **mandatory** update for manufacturers in order to correctly handle future
`transfer_hotspot_v2` transactions once `transaction_validity_version` chain variable appears on
chain. Future notices will be sent in relevant channels.
