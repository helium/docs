The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.04.2` Hotspot firmware release which includes a few
minor usability improvements, specifically allowing Makers to access a Hotspot's region parameters
via JSON-RPC and miner's CLI.

This is an **optional** but recommended update for manufacturers. If you had not updated to the
previous release `2021.11.02.0`, please upgrade to this release ASAP.
