The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.10.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes
critical bug fixes, supplementary code for finalizing activation of POC V11 related chain variables,
packet transmission and blockchain-etl fixes.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **mandatory** release for manufacturers to support the packet transfer fixes that were
applied but also to ingest chain variables which will be applied once validators and other nodes are
upgraded to a matching release. We intend to re-release PoCv11 tomorrow afternoon PT pending
confirmation from sufficient manufacturers.

### Proof-of-Coverage v11 Activation

The core developers are planning to re-release Proof-of-Coverage v11 tomorrow. We will follow up on
Discord with an exact time but we're looking at the following changes:

- `poc_version` to `11`. This activates PoCv11
- `fspl_loss` set `1.0`. This sets the loss factor due to air permeability and permittivity. At this
  value, It is assumed that there is no loss that is to be expected. Values greater than `1.0`
  assume some loss is expected. This value can be adjusted at a later date through a governance
  change.

These variables have also been implemented but will **remain unset** until a future governance
change proposes modification.

- `poc_distance_limit`. We believe this should be set to something reasonable as the FSPL curve
  starts to be less useful at great distances but given the feedback from the community, we'll keep
  this turned off.
- `witness_reward_decay_rate`: Can be used in the future to apply a soft cap on witness rewards for
  an individual Hotspot within an epoch.
- `witness_reward_decay_exclusion`: Associated with the other variable to provide a "grace" number
  of witnesses per epoch.
