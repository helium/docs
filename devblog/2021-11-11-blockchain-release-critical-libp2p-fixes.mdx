The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.11.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes
critical bug fixes for gossip and ARP in libp2p. We hope that this release will help Hotspots with
improvements on block gossip and keeping an up to date peerbook.

<!--truncate-->

This is a **mandatory** release for manufacturers to ensure that overall network gossip continues to
work as expected.
