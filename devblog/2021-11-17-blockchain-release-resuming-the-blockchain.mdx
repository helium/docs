#### Hotspot Release

The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.17.2` Hotspot firmware release which includes
CRITICAL fixes to ensure that Hotspots continue to follow the chain after the
[24 hr+ chain halt observed on November 15th](https://status.helium.com).

<!--truncate-->

This is a **mandatory** release for manufacturers to ensure that overall network gossip continues to
work as expected.

Note: A full post-mortem will be shared with the community early next week.

#### Blockchain Halt Fixes

- Consensus group members were saving transaction proposals to disk more often than was needed.
  Proposal construction state has been changed to write to disk piecewise.
- There were numerous places where blocks were unnecessarily read from the disk, leading to
  disastrous performance with the unexpectedly large block. Most of these have been eliminated by
  better block metadata caching.
- General performance sweep of the entire transaction validation and absorb pathways.
- Rewrite two low level repositories, `e2qc` and `vincenty`, in Rust to improve performance
- Added `block_size_limit` chain variable which is defaulted to 50MB on miner but can be updated in
  the future with a chain variable transaction.
