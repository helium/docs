# App Version 3.8.3

This release includes improvements to API loading, adds rewards caching, and updates how earnings
are calculated.

<!--truncate-->

## 24H Hotspot Rewards

The 24 hour Hotspot rewards and summary found on the home page of the app is now based on UTC
Calendar day and not a rolling 24 hour window. The impetus behind this change is to reduce the
number of queries to the API to calculate this value.

## App Cacheing

The app will now cache transaction data to reduce the number of calls it needs to make to the API on
app launch.

## Earnings Charts

The new default chart for Hotspots has changed from 14D to 24H. The chart also displays bucketed
earnings in a UTC calendar day and no longer a rolling 24 hour window.

The 14 and 30 day charts are also updated to UTC calendar days.

## Places Hotspot Checklist behind a feature flag

This feature flag will allow us to toggle this feature on and off without a new release.
