The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.21.2` Hotspot firmware release which includes
**highly recommended** fixes to improve network-wide block sync and snapshot ingestion on Hotspots
with less memory.

<!--truncate-->

Note that this blog post also covers the `2021.11.21.1` emergency release, which was released with
very little warning very, very early this morning. `2021.11.21.2` contains all of the fixes
mentioned in this post.

The primary fixes here are:

- Rescue blocks were not considered "plausible" by newer gossip code, and were not getting
  distributed except via fastforward.
- The snapshot loading code has been rewritten to take much less memory, allowing lower-memory
  Hotspots to load snapshots and follow the chain more easily.
