The core developers have tagged a new `2021.11.22.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes a
**mandatory fix** to unstick some Hotspot stuck syncing at 1,107,994 due to a nonce disagreement
from loading a snapshot.

The primary fix is to update all nonce values for Hotspots stuck at block 1,107,994.
