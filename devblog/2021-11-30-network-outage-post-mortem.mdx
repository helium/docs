# Overview

Last week the Helium Network experienced several disruptions. Throughout the disruptions, there was
no risk to HNT holders, and while some devices were unable to use the Network for data transfer, the
majority of devices were unaffected.

<!--truncate-->

The Helium Blockchain has been running without serious interruption for over the two years and over
1 million total blocks.

The goal of this postmortem is to provide a transparent and technical overview of the events that
took place, why they occurred, and what the Helium community and core developers did to not only
address the issues, but improve the network so it can continue to scale. The performance
improvements developed during the week and deployed by Hotspot owners and Validator operators will
benefit the network well beyond resolution of these disruptions as it continues its unprecedented
growth.

# Huge Thanks

We’d like to take this opportunity to give a HUGE THANKS to our community for your support and
patience, especially our Validator operators who quickly updated their nodes with the latest
releases to help resume normal block operations.

# Summary of Disruptions

On 2021-11-15 at approximately 2000 UTC the Helium Network was offline for approximately 30 hours
and returned to normal operations on 2021-11-17 0200 UTC. All blockchain activity was halted during
this time.

On 2021-11-20 at approximately 1805 UTC, the core developers were alerted of another outage. The
Helium network was offline for approximately 12 hours. During this time all blockchain activity was
halted.

On 2021-11-23 at approximately 0045 UTC, a chain variable was activated that caused some miners to
stop syncing at block 1,107,995. It was discovered that the root cause was a nonce disagreement when
miners consumed a snapshot including the rescue block from the second outage. Some Hotspots and
Validators were unable to sync the blockchain for approximately 4 hours. The blockchain continued
moving at this time. There was no impact to Proof-of-coverage and packet transfer for those Hotspots
that remained in sync.

Normal operations of the network were restored with the help of the Helium community who continue to
be a strength of the network, specifically Validator operators who worked closely with the core
developers to timely update their Validators with releases containing performance improvements to
proceed past the bottleneck caused by an abnormally large

# Timeline of Events

# Event Details

## 2021-11-15 Outage

The core developers with a community member identified an issue impacting the blockchain that
started with abnormally long block times then evolved into a full halt 2021-11-15 20:00 UTC. A bug
in Router code that triggered a community-hosted Router instance to propagate many state channels
dispute transactions was exacerbated by the loading of a recently released chain variable. This
combination resulted in an extremely large block (around 140 MB), which was orders of magnitude
larger than typical blocks.

Validators in the Consensus Group were unable to consume this large block causing a bottleneck that
ultimately resulted in a halt impacting all blockchain activity including PoCs, challenges, and
more.

On 2021-11-16 a few hours later (approximately 01:30 UTC) the core developers worked with the
community member to apply a fix to the community-hosted Router intended to prevent a recurrence and
this patch was released to other Router instances shortly after.

The team continued to work on addressing the large block that caused the bottleneck, including
fixing the boot looping caused by the large block, and pushing an update to increase the speed to
close state channels.

Since blockchain activity remained halted at approximately 03:00 UTC, the core developers made the
decision to put the API into maintenance mode. This meant all new submitted transactions would fail
including those from the wallet (for example, payment, add Hotspot, assert location, transfer
Hotspot, etc). This decision prevented the build up of a huge queue of commands that would have
overwhelmed the servers once the blockchain returned to normal operations.

The core developers worked on a number of performance fixes to allow Validators in the Consensus
Group to consume and move past the large block and allow validators to resume normal block
production.

At 07:34 UTC the core developers released a Validator update for Validators in the Consensus Group
to urgently update. Two-thirds + one of the members were required to update with the release to
continue to produce blocks and return the network to normal operations.

During this time, work also began on an emergency release for Hotspot firmware, once a snapshot had
been agreed upon by the Consensus Group.

By 09:24 UTC the team had tagged updated versions of blockchain-node, blockchain-etl, and router and
announced to the community to update to these latest versions to ensure smooth operations once block
production had resumed.

On 2021-11-16 at 20:58 UTC the core developers released Validator v1.5.5. This release includes a
number of performance improvements and is designed to allow Validators to consume and manage the
large block causing the bottleneck and resume normal block production.

However, to create a snapshot to update Hotspots a minimum number of blocks need to be added to the
chain so that the snapshot does not include the large blocks itself.

With block production returning to normal at approximately 0200 UTC on 2021-11-17, the core
developers needed to wait until a sufficient number of blocks were formed before they could create a
miner release that contained updated blockchain-core, blessed snapshot, and allowed Hotspots to
resume syncing, POC, and data transfer activity.

On 2021-11-17 at 08:11 UTC the core developers pushed the miner firmware release with an updated
blockchain-core, and snapshot to move beyond the large block, so older Hotspots could resume
syncing, participate in POC, and data transfer activity.

Core developers released Validator v1.5.7 on 2021-11-18 at 02:42 UTC which included fixes to the
transaction manager, which was struggling to detect it had synced with the chain, and provided
performance improvements including improved blockchain synchronization across the network and faster
transaction handling times. Hours later at 16:18 UTC the team released Validator v1.5.8 to fix a
discovered deadlock issue.

## 2021-11-20 Outage

On 2021-11-20 18:05 UTC, the core Helium developers received a notification that it was taking
longer than normal to form a new block (typically blocks are formed every minute).

Upon further investigation, it was identified that a state channel processing data transfer packets
for Discovery Mode was having issues closing due to a bug. When this happens, a large block can
start to form. Last week’s chain halt also happened when a large, 140mb sized block formed, which
Hotspots and Validators were unable to ingest. Fortunately, last week’s chain halt also allowed the
core devs to implement a variety of fail safe measures to prevent large blocks of that size from
happening again, as outlined in the [Engineering Blog](https://bit.ly/3CF1jdS). However, a second
large block still formed this weekend, which was determined to be 25mb in size.

Around 2021-11-20 18:30 UTC, the team identified a subset of Hotspots with 1GB of ram that would not
be able to ingest the block. At this point, the Discovery Mode router had several more open state
channels that could potentially become degraded and cause long blocks.

To avoid future degradation of the Network, the Helium App team decided to disable the Discovery
Mode feature until further notice. An app notification, status incident, and announcement on Discord
regarding the large block and disabling of Discovery Mode were sent. During the day, additional
progress updates were also posted on https://status.helium.com and Discord ​​as the team continued
to monitor block formation.

Once the team identified the issue (long blocks from state channels) and root cause (Discovery Mode
router), the team issued a status update and made a discord announcement.

The chain was still moving at this point.

At 2021-11-20 19:11 UTC, another state channel from the Discovery Mode router was attempting to
close, creating a long block. The team decided to create a new snapshot past the long block in an
effort to get the Network past it.

Unable to get a snapshot, and with more state channels closing with the same problem, the core
developers issued a formal blockchain outage at 20:50 UTC.

The core developers then began actively working with Validators to push out a release to get the
Consensus Group past the large blocks. At 2021-11-21 01:11 UTC, Validator build v.1.5.12 was
announced, with Validators recommended to update as soon as possible.

At 2021-11-21 06:52 UTC, an announcement went out from the Decentralized Wireless Alliance, in
conjunction with several core developers, on a proposed Rescue Block, which would reelect the
Consensus Group and close state channels used by Discovery Mode. The `Rescue Block` was issued
during the following hour, and block production resumed shortly after.

At 2021-11-21 13:22 UTC, a new required Hotspot firmware release was made available to all Hotspot
manufacturers that would enable their fleet of Hotspots to sync and begin to participate in Proof of
Coverage and data transfer once again. A second release was announced at 20:48 UTC, allowing
lower-memory Hotspots to follow the chain more easily. Read more about both releases on the
[Engineering Blog](https://bit.ly/3CDFtaM).

## 2021-11-23 Incident

The core team with DeWi decided to activate HIP 47 to increase DKG penalties for Validators. A DKG
penalty can occur if an election fails, and the Validator was part of the reason for the election to
fail. This can occur throughout the DKG process or during the signature phase. Failed elections are
significant to the network as they prevent new groups from being elected and rewards to be issued to
all network participants including Hotspots.

At 2021-11-23 00:45 UTC the proposed chain variable to adjust DKG penalties was activated per HIP47.

Shortly after, the activated chain variable immediately caused syncing issues at block 1,107,995. At
this point, blocks were still being produced by the blockchain and Consensus Group, Hotspots were
still syncing and participating in Proof-of-Coverage. Packet transfer was not interrupted at this
time. The team continued investigating the root cause.

At 2021-11-23 01:26 UTC the core developers identified that the issue is related to a snapshot that
included the rescue block issued at 1105523 and the recently deployed chain variable. Only Hotspots
and Validators that consumed the snapshot are affected.

At 2021-11-23 02:32 UTC the core team believes a snapshot will resolve this issue and begins finding
a suitable candidate. The team looked to identify a snapshot small enough for Hotspots to consume to
get them past the block.

Unable to find a suitable snapshot, the core team looks to issue a Hotspot firmware release to
realign nonce values between affected and unaffected miners. The proposed change was submitted and
reviewed. The team looks for Hotspots that are stuck syncing at 1,107,994 as beta testing
candidates. Several were identified.

At 2021-11-23 04:10 UTC the team has a firmware candidate `2021.11.22.0` and starts beta testing on
known stuck Hotspots. The testing successfully unstuck affected Hotspots and the team let the update
soak for an hour.

At 2021-11-23 05:25 UTC the core team releases `2021.11.22.0` for GA and advises all makers to
update to this release. All makers were alerted of this required update.

At 2021-11-23 06:28 UTC another build `2021.11.22.1` is made available for makers if their Hotspot
fleet experiences out-of-memory issues when loading a snapshot. This was not a required update.

The team announces an all clear. Hotspot syncing resumes for those stuck on block 1,107,994 and
Hotspots could participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

# Key Fixes

This is a shortlist of key fixes to prevent the recurrence of the events that caused the initial
outage.

A complete list and specific details to address these events can be found on the
[engineering blog](https://docs.helium.com/devblog).

- A few hours after the cause was identified the team quickly provided a fix to ensure the root
  cause prevented the issue caused by \* Router from recurring
- Significant performance enhancements were implemented (example, during testing saw Validators go
  from 600% CPU utilization to 6%) that will continue to benefit the network during normal
  operations
- A cap to limit the size of non-reward blocks to a maximum (initial default 50 MB). This limit will
  be associated with a chain variable to allow readjustment in the future. Blocks that exceed this
  threshold will be trimmed to fit.
- A cap of individual consensus member transaction proposals to 1mb was implemented as large
  proposals were identified as a significant performance bottleneck.
- Snapshot loading, a crucial tool in skipping low-resource hotspots over large blocks, has been
  improved to require dramatically less memory.

Although Helium has rapidly become the world’s largest contiguous wireless network, it is still
early days and issues will happen along the way. ​However, we believe that with the help of our
community, over time, the network will continue to grow and increase its resiliency.
