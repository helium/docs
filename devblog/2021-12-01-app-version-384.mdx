# Improvements

Updates Hotspot Earnings chart to show UTC days (7D, 14D, 30D).

<!--truncate-->

- 24h earnings chart removed because the API reports reward earnings for the last completed UTC day
  and thus will show 0 until the day is over. This can cause unnecessary concern as these 24h
  earnings chart will effectively flatline.

Updates 24h Earnings on Home screen to say last completed UTC day. Hotspot rewards below on that
Home screen also reflects last completed UTC day.

Updates Validators earnings to align on UTC days.

## Bug Fix

- Fixes QR scan on second attempt
- Fixes Android keyboard display
- Fixes Transfer Hotspot check so no transactions are stuck pending even when cleared
