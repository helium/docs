The core developers have tagged a new `2021.12.06.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes
**recommended** fixes to Seed nodes and DNS query improvements.

<!--truncate-->

Hotspot manufacturers should update to this release when possible in order to give their customers
access to these improvements. It specifically helps Hotspots in parts of Europe who have ISPs with
specific DNS settings (enforcing packet sizes for DNSSEC) and it also improves peer gossip (reducing
the amount of stale data that is shared amongst the 380K+ nodes in the network).
