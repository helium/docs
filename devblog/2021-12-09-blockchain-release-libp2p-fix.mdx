The core developers have tagged a new `2021.12.09.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes a
**recommended** bug fix in `erlang-libp2p`. This change potentially mitigates the zero-witness
beacon issue that has been afflicting, mostly, relayed Challenger Hotspots failing to receive
witness receipts. Special thanks to @groot#3396 and others in the #poc-discussion channel on Discord
for their efforts in tracking this issue down.
