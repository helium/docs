The Helium Hotspot firmware developers have identified an issue with how the LoRaWAN packet
forwarder is configured on sx1302-based Helium and RAK Hotspots after PoCv11 activation. We are
issuing an emergency release to these devices to address this issue.

<!--truncate-->

Hotspot owners would have noticed a lack of data transfer and PoC activity since PoCv11 activation
(when there was activity immediately before) on some of their devices. This firmware release should
fix this particular issue.

We have tagged `2021.12.14.1` and will be issuing an emergency fix after a short period of
testing/verification. Other Hotspot manufacturers do **not** need to take this update as it only
affects Helium and RAK Hotspots. We do recommend that all Hotspot manufacturers double check their
packet forwarder settings to use the on-chain region parameters now that PoCv11 has been activated.
See prior communications from the DeWi MOC on this matter.

### Plan

We have been beta testing `2021.12.14.1` since December 14, 2021 4:00 PM PT. Current ETA for GA is
5:30 PM PT, December 14, 2021 or sooner.
