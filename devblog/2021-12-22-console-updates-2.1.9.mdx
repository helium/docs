Sprint: 66.5

The latest version of Console (sprint 66.5) has been deployed to production.

<!--truncate-->

This release (final planned for 2021) includes the ability to configure the receive window delay
which the team believes will help with downlink issues. More information about this feature and how
to use profiles to configure the receive window delay for devices and groups can be found
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/profiles/#receive-window-delay).

Full list of this sprint’s features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/5?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/5?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not necessarily mean the team took action, for example the issue could
have been a duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

- Existing users are highly recommended to update Console/Router to the latest version was it may
  include the latest blockchain core updates to ensure smooth operations.
