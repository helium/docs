# New Features

See how your Hotspot stacks up to the Network! Weâ€™ve added the average expected network earnings per
Hotspot to see how yours perform against other Hotspots on the network. The average earnings is
based on how many Hotspots are online that day, for creating challenges, beaconing, witnessing, and
transferring data.
