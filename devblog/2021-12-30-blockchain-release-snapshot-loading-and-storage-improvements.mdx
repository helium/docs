The core developers have tagged a new `2021.12.29.2` Hotspot firmware release which includes
**recommended** improvements in `blockchain-core` specifically in how Snapshots are loaded and
blocks are stored locally on Hotspot disks.

### Snapshot Loading

As the chain continues to grow in size and more Hotspots come online, Snapshots are starting to
become larger than 300 megabytes which make it difficult for some Hotspots to load them entirely
into memory. This change to Snapshot loading allows these files to be streamed from disk in pieces
and reduce the overall memory requirements for bootstrapping a node. This is important as some
Hotspots will reset their local storage and restart syncing blocks from a Snapshot in order to clear
room for future blocks.

As a reminder, Snapshots are still generated on-chain by Validators when they come to agreement. The
last chain blessed snapshot was created at block height `1156321` or around
`2021-12-28 04:07:07 UTC`.

### Blockchain Garbage Collection

The longer a Hotspot remains online and follows the blockchain the more storage space it will
consume. Most of this storage space is dedicated to storing blocks from the blockchain, but since
blocks are less useful the older they are, a long-running Hotspot will eventually run out of space
storing blocks that it doesn't need. Previously, manufacturers have exclusively handled out-of-space
situations by completely removing the Hotspot's blockchain database and rebuilding it anew by
downloading a recent Snapshot and re-syncing. During the sync process, however, the Hotspot is
unavailable to participate in Proof-of-Coverage challenges or to route device data -- the very
things that make a Hotspot valuable to the network.

To help reduce the frequency and duration of these blockchain database rebuilds and re-syncs, there
are two configurable items in the `miner` process which will enable garbage collection of old blocks
at miner startup. These variables are:

- a `BLOCKCHAIN_ROCKSDB_GC_BYTES` environment variable (not set by default), and
- a `blocks_to_protect_from_gc` variable in the blockchain section of `sys.config` (current default:
  10_000)

At startup, the `miner` will check for the presence of `BLOCKCHAIN_ROCKSDB_GC_BYTES`. If it is
present, its value will be parsed as an integer and the `miner` will examine its blockchain database
and attempt to prune this many _bytes_ of unneeded blocks from the database. However, the garbage
collection process will always keep the most recent `blocks_to_protect_from_gc` blocks in storage,
even if the `BLOCKCHAIN_ROCKSDB_GC_BYTES` limit hasn't yet been reached, to ensure the Hotspot
retains enough recent blocks to function properly.

This should reduce the number of times a Hotspot will need to do a full reset from a Snapshot,
reducing the time a Hotspot will be unable to perform Data Transfer or Proof of Coverage.

### Additional Updates

- The core developers have also modified `transfer_hotspot_v2` transaction support to ensure that
  the owner of the hotspot is the fee payer for the transaction and guarded this change behind
  `transaction_validity_version` chain variable. Future updates will be posted to outline the time
  for activation.

- This release also contains POC-V11 related performance improvements to prepare for updating the
  LoraWAN parameters in the near future.

- Finally, the core developers have also fixed a few long standing sync stall bugs that potentially
  prevented nodes syncing from the genesis block with full validation.
