The core developers have tagged a new `2022.01.04.0` Hotspot firmware release which includes
**recommended** improvements in `miner` specifically related to ensure that Hotspots with unasserted
location are still able to sync to the head of the blockchain. Secondly this release also includes
ability to use additional packet metadata provided by certain packet forwarders.

<!--truncate-->

#### Allow usage of RSSIS when available

As reported by some community members, certain packet forwarders (SX1302 for example) include
additional packet metadata **RSSIS (RSSI of signal)**. This additional metadata more accurately
reflects the power level at which a packet gets received. With the release of `2022.01.04.0`
`miner_lora` would begin using `RSSIS` whenever it's available.
