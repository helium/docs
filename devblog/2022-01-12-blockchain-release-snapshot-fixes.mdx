The core developers have tagged a new `2022.01.12.1` Hotspot firmware release which includes
**recommended** improvements to snapshot loading and reduces their memory footprint. Furthermore,
this release also contains bug fixes for state channel handling specifically for the client side
which should now clean the internally stored channels appropriately when they observe a
`state_channel_close` transaction.

### Removal of the Hotspot Filter

As discussed on
[Discord](https://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/730418759298318346/930675333345206352) and
on other channels, the Helium team has been maintaining a network protection mechanism to prevent
malicious actors and other forms of institutional gaming on the Helium network. As we promised to
the network, we have removed this from this release but we urge the community to independently
verify this information.

We await the community's decision on what to do going forward here. Cast your vote on these and
other matters pertaining to network governance on [heliumvote.com](https://heliumvote.com)
