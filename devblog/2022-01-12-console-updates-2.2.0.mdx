Sprint: 67

Based on almost 5000 responses to our Console UI survey, 70% respondents reported accessing Console
at least multiple times a week, and almost 50% daily.

<!--truncate-->

A smartphone (97% and about equally split between ios and android) was reported as used to access
Console.

This release includes a new mobile experience that can be access via your mobile device browser
(iOS, Android), and extends the receive window delay which the team believes will help with latency
that can cause downlink issues.

More information about how to use profiles to configure the receive window delay for devices and
groups [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/profiles/#receive-window-delay).

Full list of this sprint’s features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/4?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/4?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not necessarily mean the team took action, for example the issue could
have been a duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

- New users should use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to update Console/Router to the latest version as it may
  include the latest blockchain core updates to ensure smooth operations.
