# New Features

## Updated Witnessed List

Witnessed Lists in both the App and Explorer reflects the list of Hotspots that your Hotspot has
seen beacon. This is an improved change from displaying a list of Hotspots that has witnessed your
Hotspot as the new list directly correlates with mining rewards.

<!--truncate-->

Typically, the more Hotspots in your witnessed list, the more likely you'll have higher mining
rewards. This is heavily influenced by the transmit scale of the Hotspots you witness.

In the App, for any Hotspot, tap on Hotspots Witnessed and you'll find the average transmit scale of
all Hotspots in that list. The higher the transmit scale, the higher the rewards. This is why it's
important to optimize your antenna placement so it can witness Hotspots in lesser populated areas
and higher transmit scales.
