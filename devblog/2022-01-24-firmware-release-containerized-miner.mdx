This release decouples miner releases from Hotspot firmware updates by running miner in a
self-updating container.

<!--truncate-->

Running miner in a self-updating container allows for lighter-weight, miner-only updates without the
need to fully replace Hotspot firmware. Additionally, downtime is kept to a minimum because updating
the miner container is quick and doesn't require a reboot.

While the miner self-updating container is Docker-compatible, it does not _require_ a full instance
of Docker Engine on the miner host hardware to run and in fact this firmware change utilizes a
[lightweight, daemon-less container runtime](https://podman.io/) to orchestrate the miner container
in order to reduce the unnecessary consumption of the host hardware's resources. See the Open
Container Initiative [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/) for more details about the
container specification and non-Docker container runtimes.

This is not a release for Makers and only for Helium Hotspots and RAK Hotspots. There are no miner
changes.

**Plan**

We have been beta testing `2022.01.24.0` since January 21, 2022 6:00 PM PST. Current ETA for GA is
9:00 AM PT, January 24, 2022.
