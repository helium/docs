The core developers have tagged a new `2022.01.27.0` `miner` release. This release is recommended,
but not mandatory, for all Hotspot manufacturers.

<!--truncate-->

This release includes denylist support, adds snapshot polling, and better storage reclamation. The
addition of denylist support allows asynchronous updates to this list independent of miner releases.
Additionally, `2022.01.27.0` improves block sync and fixes some rare crashes.

Reminder: `miner` Docker image releases are no longer coupled to firmware releases. This release
**does not** have a corresponding firmware release / updated SD card image (for those running RAKs
and OG hotspots).

### Denylist Support

This release includes support for a denylist of Hotspot addresses that limits witnessing and
challenging by the Challenger. More details on how it works are available in the
[denylist](https://github.com/helium/denylist) repository and in the PRs listed below. The
management of the denylist is through a coordinated multisig of the Helium, Inc team and members of
the community. This list can be updated on a separate release cycle from `miner` and Hotspot
firmware.

### Snapshot and Storage Improvements

Several updates have been made to Snapshot management and Hotspot storage of blocks. Notably, a
Consensus Group or manually blessed snapshot will now be downloaded if the Hotspot is behind on
block sync periodically rather than on startup. This should help reduce the time that a Hotspot is
not participating in the network.

Separately, a change to how blocks are stored and garbage collected has been made to reduce the
overall storage on disk. This should reduce the number of times a Hotspot needs to be cleared before
it can start syncing again. Again, this reduces the amount of time a Hotspot is not transferring
data or performing Proof-of-Coverage actions.

We've also made a change to improve block sync speed specifically related to storing PoC records in
the ledger.

### Other Fixes

We've also fixed a rare crash in miner PoC state management and implemented some JSON-RPC fixes
requested by makers.
