The core developers have tagged a new `2022.01.29.0` `miner` release. This release is recommended
for all makers, but is only mandatory for Hotspots that are no longer able to load the latest
snapshot. As the network gets larger and the snapshot size increases, Hotspots with less RAM will
have trouble loading them. We will continue to support these Hotspots until all manufacturers have
an upgrade path to Light Hotspot firmware.

Prior to this release, the blocks from snapshot were all loaded into memory before being imported;
this release switches to importing the snapshot blocks from disk, _one at a time_, and avoiding
using more memory than is strictly necessary.
