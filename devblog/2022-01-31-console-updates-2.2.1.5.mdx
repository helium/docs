Sprint: out of band

This is an out of band release that addresses the latest issue related to receive window delay,
specifically this [issue](https://github.com/helium/router/issues/571).

<!--truncate-->

The receive window delay feature has been deployed in phases, and the team believes this update will
resolve issues related to downlinks and ADR.

More information about how to use profiles to configure the receive window delay for devices and
groups [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/profiles/#receive-window-delay).

In addition, the team addressed this [issue](https://github.com/helium/router/issues/590) by
restoring the previous template functionality.

### Open source users

- New users should use the latest master version.

- Existing users are highly recommended to update Console/Router to the latest version as it may
  include the latest blockchain core updates needed to ensure smooth operations.
