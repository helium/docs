_Note: This release is only relevant to RAK/MNTD and Original Helium Hotspots._

<!--truncate-->

The `2022.02.04.1` release continues the work that the Helium team is doing to enable RAK/MNTD and
Original Helium Hotspots to use `miner` containers rather than custom firmware builds. At a high
level, this release includes several fixes to how the `miner` container operates on the firmware.
This release also fixes an issue with Diagnostic Reports, where users were unable to retrieve some
details. Finally, this release contains a fix where `miner` containers were unable to start for
Hotspots that have not been powered on for over a year.

Although this isn't directly Hotspot owner facing, it allows easier iteration of new `miner`
releases and reduces restarts and downtime of Hotspots. Separately, the work also enables the RAK
team to take over managing the firmware for RAK/MNTD Hotspots. Original Helium Hotspots will
continue to be managed by the Helium team.

This release does not update the `miner` container (which will be a separate release that will go
into testing as well). A separate announcement will follow regarding this release.

For those Hotspot owners flashing new SD Cards for RAK/MNTD and original Helium Hotspots, please use
this base image going forward. No action is required otherwise and all RAK/MNTD and original
Hotspots will receive this update automatically over the air as long as your Hotspot is plugged in
and connected to the internet.

**Plan**

We have been beta testing `2022.02.04.1` since February 4, 2022 12:00 PM PST. Current ETA for GA is
14:30 PM PT, February 4, 2022.
