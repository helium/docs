# New Features

## Transfer Hotspot v2

A new way to transfer Hotspots is now available on the app. Now transferring Hotspots is as easy as
sending a payment transaction. Hotspot **sellers** can initiate the transfer from Hotspot Settings,
the same as before, but instead of waiting for the **buyer** to accept the transaction, the transfer
is immediately submitted to the blockchain. Once cleared, the **buyer** will see the new Hotspot in
their app. When the transfer is successful, both buyers and sellers will receive a notification.

<!--truncate-->

Please note that Sellers now pay the transaction fee of ~55,000 DC.

Hotspots must have had Proof-of-Coverage activity (creating a challenge, beaconing, or witnessing)
in the last 1200 blocks (approximately 20 hours) in order to be transferred.

## Earnings Map Filter

Now available on the app, the earnings map filter introduced in Explorer in January can be found by
tapping the Map Layers icon on a Hotspot details view. Other map filters include Transmit Scale,
Witnessed Hotspots, and Coverage.

## Hotspot Year to Date earnings

See how much your Hotspot has earned this year by going to a Hotspot and tapping **YTD**.

# Bug Fixes

- Weâ€™ve fixed an issue when the Maker app uses deeplinking to add a Hotspot to the network did not
  elicit the correct error message. Now we know to check if the Hotspot was already onboarded and
  surfaces a clearer error message to contact the Maker for next steps.

# Maker Updates

- Adds Dragino Hotspot

# Chores

## Removes HNTenna from available list of Antennas

Users should use the Custom Antenna dropdown to enter the dbi of custom antennas that did not come
from approved HIP-19 Hotspots. All approved Maker antennas are still selectable from the dropdown
based on name.
