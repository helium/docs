The Helium team has tagged a new `2022.02.08.0` `firmware` release for Original Helium and RAK/MNTD
Hotspots. This minor release changes the interval between automated update checks for a Hotspot's
`miner` container. It has been updated to every 2 hours, from the current 5 minute interval. This
update also changes how a Hotspot prunes old miner images, removing the possibility of
re-downloading the latest image multiple times. These changes should reduce the amount of bandwidth
an Original or RAK/MNTD Hotspot consumes.
