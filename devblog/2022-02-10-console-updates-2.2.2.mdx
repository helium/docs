Sprint: 69

The team has pushed the latest v2.2.2 release to production. Highlights include updates to Receive
Window Delay feature, added message queue (for Production Console only) to scale frontend database,
and ux tweaks. In addition, for open source users the front end team added prebuilt Console images
hosted on Quay.io so open source users do not have to build their own Console images on docker.

The team believes certain downlink issues can be addressed by specifying a higher number to increase
the receive delay window.

For more information about this feature and how to apply to devices and labels with Configuration
profiles, check

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/7?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/7?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not necessarily mean the team took action, for example the issue could
have been a duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the updated [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use the
prebuilt Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted console image.
