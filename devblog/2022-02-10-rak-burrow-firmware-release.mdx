The Helium team has tagged a new `2022.02.10.0` `firmware` release for Original Helium and RAK/MNTD
Hotspots. All Original Helium/RAK MNTD Hotspots have a designated `hardware_type` to identify its
hardware version at the manufacturing stage. By targeting Hotspots by its `hardware_type`, this
release will enable RAK/MNTD Support teams to investigate and diagnose Hotspot-related issues in a
secure manner without interaction from the Helium Support team.

<!--truncate-->

Original Helium and RAK/MNTD Hotspot owners that install `2022.02.10.0` on an SD Card will not need
to specify their `hardware_type` in order to receive this update. The firmware will automatically
detect the Hotspot manufacturer and enable the relevant support tools.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.02.10.0` since Feb 4, 2022 12:00 PM PST. Current ETA for GA is Feb 10,
2022 3:00 PM PST.
