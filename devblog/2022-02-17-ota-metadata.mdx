The Helium team has tagged a new `2022.02.17.0` firmware release for Original Helium and RAK/MNTD
Hotspots.

<!--truncate-->

This release adds a file that enables the OTA server to target updates specific to a subset of
Hotspots for testing purposes. It also enables the final update to RAK/MNTD Hotspots so that they
can receive software updates from RAK/MNTD directly.

For those Hotspot owners flashing new SD Cards for RAK/MNTD and original Helium Hotspots, please use
this base image going forward. No action is required otherwise and all RAK/MNTD and original
Hotspots will receive this update automatically over the air as long as your Hotspot is plugged in
and connected to the internet.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.02.17.0` since Feb 16, 2022 12:00 PM PST. Current ETA for GA is Feb 17,
2022 3:00 PM PST.
