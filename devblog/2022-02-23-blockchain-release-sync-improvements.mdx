The core developers have tagged a new `2022.02.22.0` `miner` and `blockchain-core` release. This
release is **mandatory** for all Hotspot Makers (please update your fleet by March 3, 2021 00:00
UTC) and will be mandatory in the near future for Validators, ETLs, Routers and Nodes. It contains a
network improvement that is gated behind some currently inactive chain variables. Hotspots without
this update _will not_ be able to sync or mine once the chain variable is activated later.

<!--truncate-->

In addition to these improvements, this release will be the first to ship (but not use) some of the
infrastructure required for the transition to Light Hotspots: `gateway-rs`. The use of `gateway-rs`
will be
[controlled by the value of a new `sys.config` variable `gateway_and_mux_enable`](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/1370),
which is set to `false` by default.

If this variable is set to `true`, however, the image will run an internal copy of `gateway-rs` in a
support role to the miner process. In this phase of the transition, the `gateway-rs` will perform
two functions for the miner: process all traffic to and from the packet forwarder and interface with
the security chip (ECC) for all device transactions.

This will allow manufacturers to begin testing the behavior of `gateway-rs`, including its ability
to transfer device packets without fully syncing with the blockchain. The miner process will
continue to manage PoC traffic for the hotspot during this phase as usual.

Lastly, the core team has made several performance improvements that allow Hotspots to sync and stay
in sync with the blockchain over libp2p.
