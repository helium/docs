Sprint: 70

The latest v2.2.3 release has been releaseed to production by the team. Based on a number of
conversations with users, a large number of Console API’s were added to this release and existing
ones updated.

<!--truncate-->

Updated Console API docs [here](https://docs.helium.com/api/console).

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/8?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/8?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not necessarily mean the team took action, for example the issue could
have been a duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the updated [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use the
prebuilt Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted console image.
