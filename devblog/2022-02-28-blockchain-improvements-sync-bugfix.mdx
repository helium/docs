The core developers have tagged a new `2022.02.28.0` `miner` and `blockchain-core` release. This
release is **recommended** for all Hotspot Makers.

<!--truncate-->

The primary goal of this release is to address issues affecting a Hotspot's ability to stay in sync,
especially 25% of RAK Hotspots and 15% of Original Helium Hotspots. Also included is a new,
backwards compatible way for Hotspots to load compressed snapshots. This should reduce the amount of
bandwidth required for Hotspots to download snapshots.
