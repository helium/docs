The core developers have tagged a new `2022.03.07.0` `miner` and `blockchain-core` release. This
release is **recommended** for all Hotspot Makers.

<!--truncate-->

The primary change in this release is a fix for an issue that causes the miner hang forever while
downloading Snapshots. This becomes more likely for Hotspots in low bandwidth environments as the
chain grows and Snapshots get larger. As mentioned in other venues, the real solution for this is
not needing Snapshots at all when all Hotspots become Light and stop following the chain.
