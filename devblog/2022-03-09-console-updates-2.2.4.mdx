Sprint: 71

The team has released `v2.2.4` release to production. A number of usability updates were completed
including minimizing user input for Azure IoT Hub, making it simpler to add a label to new devices,
and adding abiliity to use mobile UI to scan QR codes for devices that have implemented the LoRaWAN
Device Identification QR Codes specification.

In addition, additional APIs were added to create custom integrations including HTTP, MQTT, Azure
IoT Hub, and AWS IoT Core.

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/9?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/9?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not necessarily mean the team took action, for example the issue could
have been a duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.
