The Helium team has tagged a new `2022.03.15.0` firmware release for Original Helium and RAK/MNTD
Hotspots.

<!--truncate-->

This release changes the way Hotspots manage disk usage for storing local blockchain data.
Specifically we are reducing the threshold that Hotspots clear up their disk and resync from a
Snapshot. The threshold has been reduced from 90% to 70% full.

As disk utilization increases, we have noticed that Hotspots have a harder time syncing blocks so
more frequent clearing allows Hotspots to recover from a non mining state sooner.

For those Hotspot owners flashing new SD Cards for RAK/MNTD and original Helium Hotspots, please use
this base image going forward. No action is required otherwise, and all RAK/MNTD and original
Hotspots will receive this update automatically over the air as long as your Hotspot is plugged in
and connected to the internet.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.03.15.0` since Mar 11, 2022 11:30 AM PST. Current ETA for GA is Mar 15,
2022 1:30 PM PST.
