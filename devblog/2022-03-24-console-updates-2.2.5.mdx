Sprint: 72

Console `v2.2.5` has been released to production. During this sprint the team also launched Helium
Roaming Services. LoRaWAN network providers can learn more about how to leverage Helium coverage
[here](https://blog.helium.com/helium-roaming-services-brings-new-opportunities-for-partners-4d940ee7a030).

The ability to export and import complete Organizations was added as well as a number of backend
community reported issues. Users can migrate their Organization from a Console instance hosted by
one provider to another or to their own hosted version of Console. Note Data Credits are not
transferable and will not be migrated. For more information check
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/users/#organizations).

**Important**: The Multiple Packet feature has been updated to accurately reflect the amount
specified by user configuration regardless if they're uplinks or initial joins.

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/10?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/10?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

**Important**: the seed nodes in the `.env-router` template need to be updated. Check the
`.env-router` template file, and copy the value of the `ROUTER_SEED_NODES env var` to your local
`.env-router` file.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.
