The core developers have tagged a new `2022.03.23.1` `miner` release. This release is **mandatory**
for all Hotspot Makers. We request that Hotspot Manufacturers upgrade their fleets by 12:00 UTC on
2022-03-29. This will allow the approved
[HIP 54](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0054-h3dex-targeting.md) chain variable to be
activated and ensure Hotspots can continue creating Challenges using the new H3Dex-based PoC
targeting.

<!--truncate-->

The primary changes for this release are related to simplifying configuration or improving stability
of the embedded light hotspot `helium_gateway` that, once enabled, will have device packet routing
and crypto signing delegated to it from the primary miner process. With this change, the rpc
connection between the miner and light gateway processes becomes more robust, and all UDP listening
ports are automatically configured from the primary `miner, radio_device` setting in the
`sys.config` which defaults to 1680. This release includes an updated version of the gwmp-mux
embedded application routing UDP packets between the light hotspot and miner services. This release
_does not_ enable the embedded light gateway and mux services by default.
