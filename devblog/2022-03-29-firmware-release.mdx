The Helium team has tagged a new `2022.03.29.1` firmware release for Original Helium and RAK/MNTD
Hotspots.

<!--truncate-->

This release fixes a regression in ECC key slot handling. Earlier firmware releases specified ECC
key slots 0 and 15 for public and onboarding keys, respectively. However, recent releases specified
slot 0 for both. This release reverts `sys.config` to the old spec. Note that slot 15 was only used
for _some_ very early first generation Hotspots thus very few not-yet-onboarded Hotspots were
affected by the reversion. No action is required by Hotspot owners.

Additionally, this release uses the embedded rust gateway and gwmp-mux processes to forward packets
instead of the erlang miner, as a step toward the transition to Light Hotspots.

For those Hotspot owners flashing new SD Cards for RAK/MNTD and original Helium Hotspots, please use
this base image going forward. No action is required otherwise, and all RAK/MNTD and original
Hotspots will receive this update automatically over the air as long as your Hotspot is plugged in
and connected to the internet.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.03.29.1` since Mar 24, 2022 09:30 AM PST. Current ETA for GA is Mar 29,
2022 3:00 PM PST.
