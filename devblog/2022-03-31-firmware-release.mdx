The Nova devs have tagged a new `2022.03.31.0` firmware release for Original Helium and RAK/MNTD
Hotspots.

<!--truncate-->

This release disables the embedded Rust gateway and gwmp-mux processes. The Erlang miner will begin
forwarding packets again. We have identified an issue that was preventing Data Transfer on these
specific Hotspots that we will resolve in a subsequent release.

For those Hotspot owners flashing new SD Cards for RAK/MNTD and original Helium Hotspots, please use
this base image going forward. No action is required otherwise, and all RAK/MNTD and original
Hotspots will receive this update automatically over the air as long as your Hotspot is plugged in
and connected to the internet.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.03.31.0` since Mar 31, 2022 07:30 AM PST. Current ETA for GA is Mar 31,
2022 8:45 PM PST.
