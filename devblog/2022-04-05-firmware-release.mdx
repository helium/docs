The Nova developers have tagged a new `2022.04.05.0` firmware release for Original Helium and
RAK/MNTD Hotspots.

<!--truncate-->

This is release instructs RAK/MNTD Hotspots to check RAK's OTA server for new images. Original
Helium Hotspots will continue to download their firmware updates from Nova's OTA server.

Once a RAK/MNTD Hotspot downloads and runs this firmware image, it will be managed and supported by
RAK. No action is required by Hotspot owners.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.04.05.0` since Apr 1, 2022 1:30 PM PST. Current ETA for GA is Apr 6, 2022
11:00 AM PST.
