Sprint: 73

The core team has released Console `v2.2.6` to production. A number of updates in this sprint
including increasing number of packets for multi-buy, clearer messaging for unsuccessful
integrations, and a pre-built Integration with Microsoft Azure IoT Central, instructions here:
https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/integrations/azure/

<!--truncate-->

**Important**: The Multiple Packet feature has been updated to accurately reflect the amount
specified by user configuration regardless if they're uplinks or initial joins.

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/11?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/11?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Note for existing users: With the 04/07 update to increase number of packets for Multiple Packets,
the All option for users was updated to 10.

If current users had previously chosen All, you can:

- ask users to update on UI instructions
  [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/multi-packets/), or
- run `UPDATE multi_buys SET value = 21 WHERE value = 10 AND updated_at < @YOUR_RELEASE_DATE;` where
  `YOUR_RELEASE_DATE` is the date you deployed latest changes.

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.
