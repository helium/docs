The core developers have tagged a new `2022.04.19.0` `miner` release. This release is **mandatory**
for all Hotspot Makers. We request that Hotspot Manufacturers upgrade their fleets by 00:00 UTC on
2022-05-03. This update contains Light Hotspot software, and when activated via chain variable on
May 3 2022, will change how Hotspots receive challenges, remove block sync from Hotspots, and
stabilize Hotspot performance. This will allow the approved
[HIP 55](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0055-validator-challenges.md) chain variable to be
activated and prepare for the activation of Light Hotspots.
