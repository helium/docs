Sprint: 74

The team has released the latest version of Console `2.2.7` to production. Changes include MQTT
connection overflow fixes, as well as usability and open source updates, for example payment
processor Stripe is available to open source users, and new environment variables have been added to
the `.env` template file.

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/12?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/12?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

_Important for existing users_: This version includes a mandatory update needed to support Light
Hotspot activation planned for 05/03. Users are highly recommended to update Console/Router to the
newest version without delay so they have the latest blockchain core update to ensure smooth
operations.

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.
