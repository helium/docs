The core developers have tagged a new `2022.04.27.0` `miner` release. This release is **mandatory**
for all Hotspot Makers.

<!--truncate-->

We request that Hotspot Manufacturers **upgrade their fleets by 00:00 UTC on 2022-05-11**.

This update contains Light Hotspot software, and when activated via chain variable will change how
Hotspots receive challenges, remove block sync from Hotspots, and stabilize Hotspot performance.

This will allow the approved
[HIP 55](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0055-validator-challenges.md) chain variable to be
activated and prepare for the activation of Light Hotspots.
