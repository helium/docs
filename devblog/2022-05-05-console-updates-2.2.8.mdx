Sprint: 75

The core team has released the latest version of Console 2.2.8 to production. Changes include
merging the code for XOR filter fee reduction, however it has not been activated as the vote is
still ongoing. For more information check the
[HIP](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0059-reduce-xor-filter-fees.md).

In addition, the ability for the backend to detect “bad actors” (Hotspots that don’t send packets)
was included and the team improved usability for the Console Export feature, and added a memo field
for Data Credit receipts.

Full list of this sprint’s implemented features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/13?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/13?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.
