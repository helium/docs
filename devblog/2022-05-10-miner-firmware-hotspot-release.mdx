The core developers have tagged a new `2022.05.10.0` `miner` release. This release is **highly
recommended** for all Hotspot Makers.

<!--truncate-->

We request that Hotspot Manufacturers **upgrade their fleets ASAP**.

This update contains performance fixes to Hotspots as Light Hotspots are activated, specifically
adding additional seed Validators to reduce load on the Validator fleet. This also ensures that
Challenges with zero receipts are excluded from reward calculations.
