The core developers have tagged a new `2022.05.12.0` `miner` release. This release is **highly
recommended** for all Hotspot Makers.

<!--truncate-->

This update adds a retry delay when sending PoC Witness Receipts (from a Hotspot to a Validator) so
that it has a better chance of succeeding if the Validator falls behind a few blocks from the tip of
the chain.

2022 5:50 PM PT.
