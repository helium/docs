The core developers have tagged a new `2022.05.13.0` `miner` release. This release is **highly
recommended** for all Hotspot Makers.

<!--truncate-->

This update allows Hotspots to disconnect from a poorly performing Validator and search for a new
one if the connected validator is not keeping up with the chain for 15 blocks (approximately 15
minutes).

2022 3:15 PM PT.
