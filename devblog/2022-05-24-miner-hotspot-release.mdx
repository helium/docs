The core developers have tagged a new `2022.05.24.0` `miner` release. This release is **mandatory**
for all Hotspot Makers. Contained in this release are chain variables to support Validator
Performance (to be activated some time after May 25 9:00AM PT). Failure to update your fleet before
the chain variables are activated will cause the Hotspot to stop functioning as Hotspots still
follow the blockchain.

This release also adds a timeout on gen_tcp connect on the HTTP2 client and monitors the connection
to restart on unexpected disconnects.
