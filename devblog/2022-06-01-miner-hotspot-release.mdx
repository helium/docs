The core developers have tagged a new `2022.06.01.0` `miner` release. This release is **mandatory**
for all Hotspot Makers. Contained in this release are further improvements to the flatline issue
(fixes HTTP2) and enables mux. Enabling mux allows all data packet traffic to be routed through
gateway-rs and away from the erlang miner. This is a key step towards removing Erlang from Hotspots
altogether.

This release also fixes PoC timing and lets a Hotspot retry PoC if a Validator falls behind and
catches back up quickly. This release also decreases the amount of time before a Hotspot selects a
different durable Validator if the first Validator is behind on blocks (from 15 blocks to 10
blocks).
