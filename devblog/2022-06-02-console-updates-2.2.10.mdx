Sprint: 77

The team has released the latest version of Console `2.2.10` to production.

<!--truncate-->

Key updates: additional support for following regional frequencies: KR920, EU433, and IN865.

Full list of this sprint’s features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/15?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/15?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open-source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file
  an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.
