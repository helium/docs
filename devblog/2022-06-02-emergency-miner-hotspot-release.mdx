The core developers have tagged a new `2022.06.02.1` `miner` release. This is an emergency release
to address issues found in `2022.06.01.0`. A new dependency was introduced related to telemetry work
that wasn't properly configured for the release process.

<!--truncate-->

As the Hotspot boots up, it tries to look for a dependency that doesn't exist, causing crashes on a
subset of Hotspots where "fast sync"-like features are used and causes crashes on brand new Hotspots
just added to the blockchain.

This release also disables the mux as the team has identified an issue with routing packets. Mux
will be re-enabled in the next release with the bug fix.

#### Related PRs

[#1712](https://github.com/helium/miner/pull/1712) disable the mux to bypass an issue that requires
testing [#1375](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core/pull/1375) include telemetry in app src

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.06.02.1` on Mainnet and Testnet since June 2 8:20am PT. Current ETA for
GA is June 2, 2022 9:00am PT.
