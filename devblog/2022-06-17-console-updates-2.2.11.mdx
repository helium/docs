Sprint: 78

The team has released the latest version of Console `2.2.11` to production.

<!--truncate-->

Key updates: include more clarity for users upon sign up on the Helium Foundation Console, and
customization options for Console Providers. This release also includes updates for regional
frequencies AU915.

In addition, the team has implemented mechanisms to detect and minimize abusive signup traffic.

Full list of this sprint’s features and fixes:

- Backend [(Router)](https://github.com/helium/console/milestone/16?closed=1)
- Frontend [(Console)](https://github.com/helium/router/milestone/16?closed=1)

(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open-source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml`, and
  file an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.

Docs for customization options
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/#customize-console-environment).
IMPORTANT: If you choose to customize your version of Console you need to build from source, or your
customizations will be overwritten by the docker image.
