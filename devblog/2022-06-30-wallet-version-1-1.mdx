## iOS Widget Support

iOS users can now add the Wallet app widget to their home screen! From the Home Screen, touch and
hold a widget or an empty area until the apps jiggle. Tap the Add button. In the upper-left corner,
select a widget (search Helium), choose from three widget sizes, then tap Add Widget.

Android support coming soon.

# Bug Fixes

## Crowdspot Fixes with Wallet Connect

Users attempting to link their Helium Wallet with Crowdspot may have encountered some issues. This
release should fix this.

## Helium Vote

Fixed the way the app looks up data from heliumvote.com so the most recent voting results and time
left to vote are accurate.
