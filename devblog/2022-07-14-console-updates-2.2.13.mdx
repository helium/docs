(Note: a closed issue does not mean the team took action, for example the issue could have been a
duplicate or no longer relevant).

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- **REQUIRED** upgrade for Router as it includes a necessary Blockchain Core update.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open-source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml`, and
  file an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.

Docs for customization options
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/#customize-console-environment).
IMPORTANT: If you choose to customize your version of Console you need to build from source, or your
customizations will be overwritten by the docker image.
