The core developers have tagged a new `2022.07.14.0` `miner` release. This release contains fixes to
packet delivery to make it more reliable when Hotspots fall offline for a brief period of time (it
will queue up to 10 device packets it saw) and fixes to let Hotspots send unknown packets if it's
not synced with the blockchain.

<!--truncate-->

This release also contains fixes that will allow Hotspots to transfer packets using the Light
Hotspot firmware code (or gateway-rs) and allows for individual Makers to turn off blockchain sync
for their Hotspot fleets. See directions below on how to enable mux and turn off chain sync.

Hotspots can expect to make 3 connections to a Validator when mux is enabled (one for PoC, one for
packets, and one for activity).

&nbsp;

# Enabling Mux

- Makers must enable mux explicitly in their docker overlay by adding
  `{gateway_and_mux_enable, true}` to your configuration file under the `miner` application block

# Turn off Blockchain Sync

- Makers must turn off chain sync explicitly in their docker overlay by adding
  `{gateways_run_chain, false}` to your configuration file under the `miner` application block

## Known Issues

Some Hotspot owners may have issues running diagnostic reports over Bluetooth. This is likely due to
services that the `miner` provides, and if chain sync is off, some of those services may not be
available to support Bluetooth services, like diagnostic reports.
