The Nova developers have tagged a new `2022.07.15.0` firmware release for Original Helium Hotspots.
This minor release enables mux and disables blockchain sync. Enabling mux allows the transferring of
packets to use the Light Hotspot part of the codebase and is a further step forward in the Light
Hotspot transition.
