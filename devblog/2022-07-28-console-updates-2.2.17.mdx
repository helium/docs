The team has released the latest version of Console `2.2.17` to production. This release includes a
rollup of out of band releases:

<!--truncate-->

#### Fix HTTP Integration Header

The core team has identified an issue with HTTP Integration headers that was introduced with the
latest release v2.2.13.

When Console sends the data over an HTTP Integration that includes headers and specific syntax
(period followed by number) it indexed the keys.

#### Update GRPC component

The core team identified an issue with the grpcbox component and released v2.2.15 to address it.
This issue is significant because with the latest miner release all Hotspot connections to Console
use GRPC after Hotspot manufacturers have enabled mux.

#### Update blockchain core

The latest release includes an updated blockchain core to fix a recent issue discovered on the
MOBILE Testnet and it improves packet transfer speed from Hotspots.

Prior to this update packet transfer required an additional communication layer from Hotspots to
Console before device packets were sent. These extra hops added delays and could impact reliability
depending on the state of the Hotspot.

Hotspots with the latest firmware simply send packets directly to Console improving transfer speed
and reliability.

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- **REQUIRED** upgrade for Router as it includes a necessary Blockchain Core update.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open-source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml`, and
  file an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.

Docs for customization options
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/#customize-console-environment).
IMPORTANT: If you choose to customize your version of Console you need to build from source, or your
customizations will be overwritten by the docker image.
