The core developers have tagged a new `2022.08.02.0` `miner` release. This release contains
improvements to packet delivery such that when a Hotspot sees a packet, it sends the payload right
away to the Router (and thus, recipient) immediately. Data transfer reliability is expected to
improve with this release.
