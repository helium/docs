The team has released the latest version of Console `2.2.20` to production. This release includes a
rollup of a number of updates:

<!--truncate-->

#### v2.2.20

This update fixes out of order uplinks that occur when Hotspots are very slow to deliver data. This
Hotspot delay could be caused by extreme latency or local power or network outages.

#### v2.2.19

Key updates include: connectivity updates with grpc, upgrading the LoRaWAN library, and addressing
an issue to allow dual plan support in Australia.

#### v2.2.18

Addresses a serious issue related to device joins and the upcoming Hotspot release planned for early
next week. Without this update devices may experience issues attempting to join.

### Open source users

Check the [readme](https://github.com/helium/console) for instructions on how to use prebuilt
Console images.

- **REQUIRED** upgrade for Router as it includes a necessary Blockchain Core update.

- New open source users should follow Option 1 listed in the readme and use
  `docker-compose-quay.yaml` as the template for their docker-compose file.

- Existing open-source users can update their existing docker-compose file and replace the lines for
  just the "console" section with the updated lines in the latest `docker-compose-quay.yaml` file.
  If something does not work, simply revert your changes back to the `docker-compose-quay.yaml`, and
  file an issue [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues).

Database migrations will still happen automatically when using the hosted Console image.

Docs for customization options
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/#customize-console-environment).
IMPORTANT: If you choose to customize your version of Console you need to build from source, or your
customizations will be overwritten by the docker image.
