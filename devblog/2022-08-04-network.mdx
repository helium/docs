The team is prioritizing its focus on issues to improve network reliability. Any new features or
enhancement requests, while appreciated, will be added to our backlog and prioritized accordingly.

<!--truncate-->

Rather than the usual sprint cadence of scheduled releases, updates that help stabilize the network
will be released immediately.

This accelerated release schedule will not impact users of hosted Console offerings by Helium
Foundation or Nova Labs, but open source users will need to upgrade on a more frequent cadence.

Just a reminder, Console is part of a system with multiple components, and certain issues will
require updates to both Hotspots (gateway-rs) and the backend (Router). Hotspot firmware updates
require the team to work with manufacturers to deploy.

The real-world application of this network is paramount and what differentiates this project from
99.9% of other decentralized projects. Confidence for users of the network is critical for its
success and is a top priority for the team.
