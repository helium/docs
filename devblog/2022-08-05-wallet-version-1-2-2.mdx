## Add unknown addresses to Address Book

Add an unknown wallet address to your Address Book with a long press.

## Tap to Copy

Whenever you see a transaction hash or an address, a quick press will automatically copy the hash or
address to your clipboard.

# Bug Fixes

## App Closing after Launch

Fixed a bug for iOS and Android where the app would close after opening. This is fixed in 1.2.2
only.
