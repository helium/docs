The core developers have tagged a new `2022.08.17.1` `miner` release. This release disables
peer-to-peer activity when the Hotspot is no longer syncing the chain. This improves overall
performance for the peer-to-peer network for other participants and stability of the network as a
whole. Other improvements include an update to HTTP2 process that the Hotspot uses to communicate to
Validators (over GRPC), and a Kerlink-specific improvement that fixes the RSSI computation if the
SNR is lower than zero to reduce the number of invalid Proof-of-Coverage challenges and receipts.
