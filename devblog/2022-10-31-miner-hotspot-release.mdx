The core developers have tagged a new `2022.10.28.0` `miner` release. This release adds exponential
back-off for Hotspots when requesting ledger information from Validators. This also ensures timely
back-off when block times are too high and avoids too many Hotspots attempting to connect to a
Validator. The pull request specifically addresses the blockchain outages over the past week from a
Hotspot's perspective.
