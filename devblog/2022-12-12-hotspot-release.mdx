The Nova developers have tagged a new `2022.12.13.0` Hotspot release for Original Helium Hotspots.
This release prepares Hotspots for off-chain proof-of-coverage by updating the automatic beacon rate
to every 6 hours, adds "jitter" to the beacon rate such that in the event all Hotspots come online
at the same time, the PoC system is not overwhelmed with PoC.

### Plan

We have been testing `2022.12.13.0` since December 13, 2022. Release for Original Helium Hotspots
will be December 13, 2022 at 2:15pm PST. GA for other Hotspot Manufacturers is December 19, 2022 at
9:30am PST.
