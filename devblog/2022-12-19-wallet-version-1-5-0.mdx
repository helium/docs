## Helium Wallet 1.5.0

Prepare for the Helium migration to the Solana blockchain! This app update makes it easier for "blue
app" users to successfully migrate to the Wallet app to manage their tokens. For those already on
the Wallet app, migration will be easy. Just make sure your app is updated to the latest versions
and your tokens will automatically be updated to use Solana.

# Helium Hotspot 4.3.0

The Helium blockchain migration to Solana is almost here! Prepare for the update by migrating your
wallet to the Helium Wallet App (aka black app)! Migration is easy. Make sure you have Helium Wallet
app v1.5.0 installed, then initiate the migration from the Helium Hotspot app.

You'll continue using the same 12 words in the Wallet app and continue managing your tokens. When
the migration happens, you'll be all set on the black app.

## Support for Wallet Migration

Adds 1-click support to export your 12 word seed phrase wallet to the Helium Wallet app (v1.5.0
required)
