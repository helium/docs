## Helium Wallet 1.6.0

This latest update adds more behind the scenes support for the Solana migration, including transactions, adding, updating, and viewing Hotspots on Solana L1, and swap support.

In addition, 1.6.0 fixes a bug where users could not sign into Crowdspot and fixes the display of HNT price on iOS widgets.
