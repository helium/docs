## Intro

At the end of September, the Helium Foundation changed our tile server from Mapbox to Protomaps. We
are currently on track to saving ~$2,000 dollars a month (from our most expensive month). Given how
important maps are to us and the community, we are thrilled to be able to save this much money and
want to share some insights we learned while executing this migration. Hopefully these insights can
help other developers who are thinking of making the leap. I’d recommend a developer use this as an
addendum to the existing protomaps setup documentation.

## What is protomaps?

[Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/) is an open source self-hosted way to serve vector tiles. The
tiles are built with the use of [OpenStreetMaps](https://openstreetmap.org/) and stored in the
[pmtile format](https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles). This is “a single-file archive format for
pyramids of tiled data”. PMTiles readers can then use HTTP range-requests to get the subset of data
it needs.

All you need to do in order to use protomaps:

- is to upload a single planet-scale (or regional) map to your CDN.
- use one of the multiple open-source front-end libraries to render the map itself.

## Uploading tips

You can upload your PMTiles to any S3 compatible cloud-storage platform that supports HTTP
range-requests. You can find a long
[list of possible cloud platforms](https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles/cloud-storage) from protomaps.
While those are all possible options, **Cloudflare is the recommended storage platform as it has no
bandwidth fees**. Ultimately, that is what we did.

While Protomaps strongly recommends Cloudflare as a storage platform, it is much looser in its
recommendations on how to upload the file. It lists out the web interface (for small files), the
pmtiles CLI, rclone and finally the AWS CLI. **I’d recommend skipping straight to the AWS CLI**.
While the PMTiles CLI and rclone work great for small files, it seems that multi-part uploads
currently do not work. Despite trying multiple different upload configurations (e.g. chunk size,
maximum concurrency) these uploads would invariably fail with a `SignatureDoesNotMatch` error.
Ultimately, for large files (the planet-size file is 110GB), the AWS CLI is the only option that
works.

To make the AWS CLI work all you need to do is:

1. configure an AWS profile with the Access Key Id and Secret Key that the
   [Cloudflare R2 API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/tokens/) provides you.
1. Upload your desired file to your R2 bucket

   ```
   aws s3 cp FILE.pmtiles s3://R2_BUCKET_NAME/ --endpoint-url https://CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com --profile cloudflare
   ```

## R2 Worker and CORS setup

After uploading your pmtiles files to Cloudlflare R2, you’ll need to create a Worker to expose said
file to the public. Protomaps provides instructions on how to do so with both the web console and
through Wrangler. At the time of writing this, the instructions for the web console no longer match
the UI on Cloudflare. For this reason and for further CORS setup, **I’d recommend setting up your
Worker with Wrangler
[per the instructions](https://protomaps.com/docs/cdn/cloudflare#alternative:-use-wrangler)**.

Your `wrangler.toml` already comes with an `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` var which you can set to enable CORS
for your front-end. As currently set up however, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` only works on exact string
matches. If you are like the Helium Foundation and would like to also enable CORS for your preview
deployments, then you can edit the `PMTiles/serverless/cloudflare/src/index.ts` file with the
following code snippet.

```
      if (typeof env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS !== "undefined") {
        const previewRegex = /YOUR_REGEX/g;
        const requestOrigin = request.headers.get("Origin") || "";

        for (const origin of env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(",")) {
          if (origin === requestOrigin || origin === "*") {
            allowed_origin = origin;
          }
        }

        if (!!requestOrigin.match(previewRegex)) {
          allowed_origin = requestOrigin;
        }
      }
```

## Maplibre-libre-js

Since we were already using Mapbox to render our front-end, we opted to use maplibre-gl-js which is
an open source fork of [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js). For the most
part, migrating from one to the other is as straightforward as installing the dependencies and
[adding the pmtiles protocol](https://protomaps.com/docs/frontends/maplibre#installation). There
were however two minor gotcha’s.

### Watch your urls

This one is more an indictment of myself versus the documentation itself, but be extra careful of
the URLs you use when adding the sources. If you’re like me and looking at the documentation which
includes the two following code samples:

```
{
  "sources": {
    "protomaps": {
        "type": "vector",
        "tiles": ["https://mycdn.com/tileset/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt"],
    }
  }
}
—--
{
  "sources": {
    "protomaps": {
        "type": "vector",
        "url": "pmtiles://https://example.com/example.pmtiles",
    }
  }
}
```

You might think that when serving the tileset locally, that the following is correct.

```
"tiles": [http://127.0.0.1:8080/world.pmtiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt]
```

It however, most definitely is not. Instead, if you are serving files locally the following two
formats work.

```
    sources: {
      protomaps: {
        type: "vector",
        tiles: [
          "pmtiles://http://127.0.0.1:8080/world.pmtiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt",
        ],
      },
    },
—--
    sources: {
      protomaps: {
        type: "vector",
        url: "pmtiles://http://127.0.0.1:8080/world.pmtiles",
      },
    },
```

### Update your styling

Mapbox and Protomaps use two different sets of vector basemap layers. As such, if you are trying to
migrate from Mapbox to Protomaps your existing Mapbox styles will not render anything. I’d recommend
you use or adapt one of the existing `protomaps-theme-base` layers as shown
[in the docs](https://protomaps.com/docs/frontends/maplibre#vector-basemaps). Alternatively, feel
free to use
[our modified layers](https://github.com/helium/network-explorer/blob/main/src/components/HotspotsMap/mapLayersDark.tsx)
(note that we have removed a number of layers that were not of interest to us).

## Conclusion

While we ran into a hiccup or two while completing the migration, we couldn’t be happier with the
end result of our migration from Mapbox to Protomaps. While Mapbox has the benefit of being a nice
out of the box solution, when you have the time (a few days at most following the above advice), I’d
recommend you migrate over to Protomaps. Since our migration we have experienced equal or better
performance for a fraction of the cost. In recognition of this our CEO Abhay (who happened to work
with Brandon, the man behind protomaps) has decided to become a sponsor of the project. It's that
great!
