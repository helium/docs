An incident involving oracle rewards implementation on Solana was identified on December 12, 2023,
revealing a discrepancy in MOBILE token rewards due to configuration errors in the delegator rewards
percentage. The issue led to an over-emission to delegators and an underfunded rewards escrow,
amounting to a total discrepancy of approximately 274 million MOBILE tokens. To address this, the
protocol will temporarily increase emissions, effectively replenishing the escrow and slightly
increasing the circulating supply of MOBILE by 274 million, a minor deviation that does not affect
the max supply of 230B.

## Technical Background

To understand the incident, it helps to understand the technical details of oracle rewards
implementation on Solana.

Rewards for all rewardable entities (Hotspots, mappers, etc) are collated via oracles that crunch
the numbers on PoC, data transfer, etc. The smart contracts on-chain do not keep track of rewards
for individual entities. Instead, the contracts emit all subnetwork tokens into an escrow account
reserved for these rewards. A separate contract then allows the oracle to set the rewards of a given
entity on-chain. When rewards on an entity are claimed, they come from this pool of rewards.

94% of all rewards for the subnetworks are handled by the oracle network. The other 6% go to veHNT
delegators. This 6% is handled by the smart contracts.

It is important to note that at any given time, all 94% of subnetwork rewards are not necessarily
enabled. For example, the 4% subnetwork rewards carved out for oracles are currently not enabled and
therefore not emitted.

To account for this, the smart contracts have a concept of both (a) an emissions schedule in terms
of total tokens emitted per epoch and (b) a percentage allocation of these total tokens that goes to
delegators.

As an example, if the total emissions are 66% of the theoretical max, the delegator rewards
percentage is actually `.06 / .66 * 100 = 9.090909%`.

This works because `9.09% * 66%` is `6%` of the total theoretical emissions.

## Discovery

On 12/12/23 as part of routine monitoring and system improvements, the protocol team implemented a
new metric to measure the integrity of the rewards escrow. This metric sought to compare the
theoretical number of unclaimed rewards vs the amount of tokens in the escrow account. The goal was
to improve alerting in the case of an exploit or slow drain of the escrow. This was implemented by
comparing the total lifetime rewards of all entities in the system vs the total claimed rewards of
all entities in the system.

It was then discovered that there was a discrepancy of ~274m MOBILE tokens. Both the Helium
Foundation and Nova Labs teams convened to track down the source of the discrepancy. This issue
could happen from

1. Over-emissions from the oracles.
2. Under-emissions from the smart contracts.
3. An exploit.

## Cause

After digging into the data, the team found that the smart contracts had been over-emitting to
delegators and under-emitting to the rewards escrow. It was also found that the smart contracts
emitted rewards for MOBILE mappers 2 days fewer than the oracles had been emitting mapper rewards.

The former bug was caused by the delegator rewards percentage chainvar (see above Background). This
chainvar was still set for emissions of 66%, while the actual emissions with the addition of mappers
is 86%. This meant the variable was set to `9.09%` instead of `6.98%`. This led to an extra
`1490312.96508` being emitted to delegators and not to the rewards escrow. This does not mean that
Hotspots/mappers were rewarded any less, but instead meant that the escrow was underfunded – it did
not have enough tokens to fund all claims.

The latter bug was related to the delegator rewards percentage. When mappers were enabled, there
were coordination issues between the oracles and smart contracts. These issues were discovered, and
the team attempted to rectify them by temporarily increasing emissions for an epoch. Unfortunately,
when the team updated the emissions, they accidentally reset the delegator rewards percentage to the
previous value.

## Impact

The smart contracts have been over-emitting by `1,490,312.96508 MOBILE` a day since August
1st, 2023. This amounts to `201,192,250.2858 MOBILE` missing from the escrow.

Additionally, `73,229,486.7032 MOBILE` were not emitted for the addition of mappers due to the
timing and coordination issues.

This leaves a discrepancy of `274,421,737.0063 MOBILE`

## Next Steps

To repair the issue, the protocol will temporarily increase emissions for the next epoch starting
2023–12-27. This will cause increased emissions to the escrow, which will fill the underfunding.
Theoretically, this will also increase the circulating supply of MOBILE by `274M`. In 
practice those 274M MOBILE had not yet been claimed and it is unlikely this emission will affect the
rate at which they will be claimed in the future. 

While this is substantially less than the unemitted rewards for oracles and service providers and
does not affect max supply of MOBILE, it is still a deviation from expected total emissions by at
most 0.12%.

## Prevention

Two major efforts will prevent this issue from happening again.

The first is that contract changes currently being audited will allow the on-chain emission schedule
to be 100% of theoretical emissions. This change will allow the oracles to specify the amount that
is not emitted, rather than using on-chain configuration to control portions that are not emitted.
Along with enabling HIP-87, this will also make coordination issues with the oracles less likely to
occur. Instead, the delegator 6% and the agreed-upon emissions schedules can be encoded and never
again changed. Instead of requiring changes every time a new rewardable entity has its emissions
enabled.

The second is the monitoring solution that led to this discovery. The team will now be able to
monitor and be alerted to any underfunding of the escrows. With this solution, issues like this will
be discovered before they can have a large impact.
