# 5G On Helium

Today all mobile networks are built top-down by service providers (e.g., AT&T and Verizon in the
United States). Future networks will likely be a hybrid of large-scaled operators and people-owned
5G Hotspots due to demands of consumer behavior (higher bandwidth and lower latency requirements)
and the physics of wireless radio. More data on the wireless network requires higher frequency
bands, which requires denser networks with more nodes, which further increases the cost of site
acquisition.

The Helium model decentralizes site acquisition costs and enables communities to participate in
building reliable, high bandwidth networks using technologies like CBRS and Wi-Fi. This doesnâ€™t
completely replace service providers altogether. Instead, we see service providers as a critical
component of this ecosystem.

## CBRS Radios

Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is a wide broadcast 3.5Ghz band in the United States that
does not require a tower operator to acquire spectrum licenses.

More information about CBRS can be found on the
[Federal Communications Commission Website](https://www.fcc.gov/35-ghz-band-overview)

5G Hotspots can participate in providing 5G cellular coverage when connected to Indoor or Outdoor
CBRS Small Cell Radios while also participating in providing LoRaWAN coverage.

## Network of Networks

With the passing of
[HIP 51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) a general
structure for onboarding new Decentralized Network Protocols (DNPs) to the broader Helium Network
was created. The Helium Mobile DAO with Helium 5G Hotspots are the first step in the evolution of
the Helium ecosystem.

## Helium 5G Rollout

The passing of [HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md)
allows for the creation of a MOBILE tokens that will reward 5G Hotspot operators on
the existing Helium blockchain. This will immediately allow any online 5G Hotspot with a Small Cell
Radio to mine MOBILE tokens.

50B MOBILE tokens are pre-mined as specified in the
[Economics Overview](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview)
and assigned to a wallet held by the Helium Foundation. A total of 250B MOBILE tokens are allocated
to the subDAO. Foundation.

:::note Mainnet Validator latest Beta build: v1.12.1

The core team has tagged a beta release v1.12.1. This build provides support for the MOBILE token
issuance as defined and approved by the community in
[HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md).

It enables transactions that can create the new MOBILE subnetwork and assign a pre-mined amount of
MOBILE tokens on the chain. When activated, this will enable MOBILE token mining by online 5G
radios.
