# 5G On Helium

Today all mobile networks are built top-down by service providers (e.g., AT&T and Verizon in the
United States). Future networks will likely be a hybrid of large-scaled operators and people-owned
5G Hotspots due to demands of consumer behavior (higher bandwidth and lower latency requirements)
and the physics of wireless radio. More data on the wireless network requires higher frequency
bands, which requires denser networks with more nodes, which further increases the cost of site
acquisition.

The Helium model decentralizes site acquisition costs and enables communities to participate in
building reliable, high bandwidth networks using technologies like
[CBRS](./5g-on-helium/cbrs-radios) and Wi-Fi. This does not completely replace service providers
altogether. Instead, we see service providers as a critical component of this ecosystem.

## Network of Networks

With the passing of
[HIP 51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) a general
structure for onboarding new Decentralized Network Protocols (DNPs) to the broader Helium Network
was created. The Helium Mobile DAO with 5G Hotspots is the first step in the evolution of the Helium
ecosystem.

## The Helium MOBILE Token

The passing of [HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md)
allows for the creation of MOBILE tokens that will reward 5G Hotspot operators on the existing
Helium Blockchain. This will immediately allow any online 5G Hotspot with a Small Cell Radio to mine
MOBILE tokens.

50B of 250B MOBILE is pre-mined as specified in the
[Economics Overview](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview) 
in the community-approved HIP 53 and deposited to the Helium Foundation. For more information on the 
pre-mine and how it is used, see [Pre-Mine](/5g-on-helium/mobile-pre-mine).
