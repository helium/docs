# 5G On Helium

Today all mobile networks are built top-down by service providers (e.g., AT&T and Verizon in the
United States). Future networks will likely be a hybrid of large-scaled operators and people-owned
5G Hotspots due to demands of consumer behavior (higher bandwidth and lower latency requirements)
and the physics of wireless radio. More data on the wireless network requires higher frequency
bands, which requires denser networks with more nodes, which further increases the cost of site
acquisition.

The Helium model decentralizes site acquisition costs and enables communities to participate in
building reliable, high bandwidth networks using technologies like
[CBRS](./5g-on-helium/cbrs-radios) and Wi-Fi. This does not completely replace service providers
altogether. Instead, we see service providers as a critical component of this ecosystem.

## Network of Networks

With the passing of
[HIP 51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) a general
structure for onboarding new Decentralized Network Protocols (DNPs) to the broader Helium Network
was created. The Helium Mobile DAO with 5G Hotspots is the first step in the evolution of the Helium
ecosystem.

## The Helium MOBILE Token

The passing of [HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md)
allows for the creation of MOBILE tokens that will reward 5G Hotspot operators on the existing
Helium Blockchain. This will immediately allow any online 5G Hotspot with a Small Cell Radio to mine
MOBILE tokens.

50B (billion) of 250B MOBILE is pre-mined as specified in the
[Economics Overview](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview)
in the community-approved HIP 53 and deposited to the Helium Foundation. For more information on the
pre-mine and how it is used, see [Pre-Mine](/5g-on-helium/mobile-pre-mine).

### Emissions Curve

There will be a max supply of 250B (billion) MOBILE with issuance halvenings of every 2 years
aligned with the HNT issuance halvenings. The first halving will occur on August 1, 2023, to align
with HNT halving and will continue on a 2-year cycle afterward. This creates a "stub period" as
defined by [HIP 53: Mobile subDAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md) which
will begin when normal emissions of MOBILE tokens begin (and MOBILE can be redeemed by HNT in the
subDAO's treasury). The date for this is currently TBD and dependent on core developers implementing
the HNT token treasury and redemption transactions on the Helium Blockchain. This is defined as
Phase 2 of [HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) for all
new subDAOs.

Before normal emissions of MOBILE begin,
[HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) defined an earlier
launch of MOBILE tokens assigning a premine amount of MOBILE to the Helium Foundation. The Helium
Foundation will work with the core developers to begin the Genesis period of MOBILE rewards. Genesis
rewards will be paid out of the Foundation's pre-mined MOBILE rewards pool. Read more about the
pre-mine distribution [here](/5g-on-helium/mobile-pre-mine).

Currently, the Helium Foundation intends to issue 100M (million) tokens per day in the Genesis
period, and it will be proportionally distributed to all active 5G Small Cell Radios as described
below.

## Manage Tokens with the Helium Wallet App

- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hnt-wallet/id1609525848)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet.app&gl=US)

A 5G Hotspot with an attached and properly registered Small Cell Radio will start earning MOBILE
automatically once the 5G rewards are activated on the Helium Blockchain.

MOBILE Rewards are earned as one "lump sum" by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot with at least one
connected, SAS registered CBRS Small Cell Radio.
