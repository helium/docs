# 5G Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof of Coverage” (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity, you can read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](./blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

:::info One Way Traffic

CBRS Small Cell Radios can only operate as transmitters, they are not able to receive incoming data
and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

## Current 5G PoC Reward Elegibility

MOBILE Rewards are earned by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot and at least one connected, SAS registered,
CBRS Small Cell Radio in one "lump sum" every roughly 24-hour interval. This system allows a high
tolerance for downtime in infrastructure that is beyond the 5G Hotspot Owner's control.

To qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

:::note What is a "Heartbeat"?

A "heartbeat" is an authorization that allows the Small Cell Radio to transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds, this
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

## Stage 1: Genesis Rewards

:::info Reward Targets

During Genesis, 100M Mobile tokens are allocated to be issued per day. Given the different Reward
Transactions triggers, daily rewards may not equate to an exact 100M MOBILE.

Check out this
[Example Reward Transaction](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/0n4TO_2W14rrsGt-nxBTotiHFCFukkO04QoXIxaOtAY)
for reference.

### Genesis Phase 1: Time Period Triggered Rewards

> - Reward Period is 1440 blocks and closely aligns with 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC.
> - Reward submission occurs approx 17 hours later, once a day, around 17:00 UTC.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

### Genesis Phase 2: Consensus Election Triggered Rewards

> - Reward Period is 48 Consensus Elections (1440 blocks, approximately 24 hours).
> - Reward submission occurs approx 30 minutes after the Reward Period ends.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

### Genesis Phase 3: Speed Test and Quality of Service

> - 5G Hotspots perform periodic speed tests which will be considered in reward calculations.
> - A minimum Download speed, Upload speed, and Latency will be required by each 5G Hotspot to
>   ensure it is providing quality coverage.

A 5G Hotspot will perform a speed test every 12 hours with the results being averaged over the
previous 6 tests.

To meet the speed test requirement a 5G Hotspot must have a rolling average Download speed of at
least 100Mbps **AND** a rolling average Upload speed of at least 10Mbps **AND** a rolling average
Latency of 50ms or less.

**A 5G Hotspot that does not meet all three of these requirements will be excluded from rewards
calculations in the given Reward Period.**

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.
- Maintain 100 Mbps or greater Download speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 10 Mbps or greater Upload speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 50ms or lesser Latency on a 6-interval moving average.

:::warning

**The Minimum Download speed and Upload speed requirements will increase over time.**

**This is to give Hotspot hosts time to improve their setup and internet connections and to ensure
that 5G Hotspots are providing high-quality coverage.**

:::

:::caution

In a review of existing speed test data, many Download speed test results are capped _just_ below
the 100Mbps requirement, and is possibly a result of the use of non-gigabit networking equipment.

Network switches that are advertised as "100/10" switches are often "90/9" in real-world use.

:::

### Genesis Phase 4: Reward Frequency Increase

> - Reward Periods shortened to 2 Epochs (60 blocks, or approximately 1 hour).
> - Rewards transactions are triggered with every other Consensus Election.

### Genesis Phase 5: Reward Period Decoupling

> - Decouple Reward Period From Reward Submission Time.
> - Increase tolerance for delay of heartbeat and speed test data by allowing rewards to be sent for
>   the receipts that came in late.
