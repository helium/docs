# 5G Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof of Coverage” (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity, you can read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](/blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

:::info One Way Traffic

CBRS Small Cell Radios can only operate as transmitters, they are not able to receive incoming data
and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

## Current 5G PoC Reward Elegibility

MOBILE Rewards are earned by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot and at least one connected, SAS registered,
CBRS Small Cell Radio in one "lump sum" every roughly 24-hour interval. This system allows a high
tolerance for downtime in infrastructure that is beyond the 5G Hotspot Owner's control.

To qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

:::note What is a "Heartbeat"?

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that the connected CBRS Small Cell Radio(s)
is authorized to transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds, this
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

## Stage 1: Genesis Rewards

:::info Reward Targets

During Genesis, 100M Mobile tokens are allocated to be issued per day. This 24-hour Reward Period is
expressed in blocks, and aligns as close to the Reward Period time range as possible, but may not
line up _exactly_ on 24-hour intervals.

Given this slight differentiation, daily rewards may not equate to an exact 100M MOBILE. Check out
this
[Example Reward Transaction](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/0n4TO_2W14rrsGt-nxBTotiHFCFukkO04QoXIxaOtAY)
for reference.

:::

### Genesis Phase 1: Time Period Triggered Rewards

> - Reward Period is approximately 1440 blocks and closely aligns with 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC.
> - Reward submission occurs approx 17 hours later, once a day, around 17:00 UTC.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

### Genesis Phase 2: Time Period Triggered Rewards with Minimum Delay

:::info

This is the Current Phase as of August 29, 2022

:::

> - Reward Period is approximately 1440 blocks and closely aligns with 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC.
> - Reward submission occurs approx 15 minutes after the Reward Period ends, around 00:00 UTC.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

### Genesis Phase 3: Speed Tests and Quality of Service

> - Reward Period is approximately 24 hours, with Reward submission occurring at approximately 01:30
>   UTC.
> - 5G Hotspots perform periodic Speed Tests which will be considered in reward calculations.
> - A minimum Download speed, Upload speed, and Latency will be required by each 5G Hotspot to
>   ensure it is providing quality coverage.

To meet the Speed Test requirements as outlined in
[HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#oracle-operations), a 5G Hotspot
must have a rolling average Download speed of at least 100Mbps **AND** a rolling average Upload
speed of at least 10Mbps **AND** a rolling average Latency of 50ms or less.

A 5G Hotspot will perform a Speed Test approximately every 12 hours with the results being averaged
by the MOBILE PoC Oracle over the previous `6` tests. This moving average is reset following a speed
test gap of `>12 hours` and a minimum of `2` Speed Test results are required to be eligible for
Genesis Rewards.

:::note Moving Average

The "Moving Average", also known as a "Rolling Average" is the average of the 6 most recent speed
test results for each download, upload, and latency.

:::

#### Example Calculation Tables

Here are a set of tables to help visualize all of these components that make up the Speed Test
result.

:::info

Note that it may take up to 12 hours for newly connected 5G Hotspots to perform a Speed Test and a
minimum of 2 Speed Tests are required for the MOBILE PoC Oracle to calculate a moving average.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.
- Maintain 100 Mbps or greater Download speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 10 Mbps or greater Upload speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 50ms or lesser Latency on a 6-interval moving average.

:::warning

**The Minimum Download speed and Upload speed requirements will increase over time.**

**This is to give Hotspot hosts time to improve their setup and internet connections and to ensure
that 5G Hotspots are providing high-quality coverage.**

:::

:::caution

In a review of existing Speed Test data, many Download Speed Test results are capped _just_ below
the 100Mbps requirement, and is possibly a result of the use of non-gigabit networking equipment.

Network switches that are advertised as "100/10" switches are often "90/9" in real-world use.

### Genesis Phase 4: Heartbeats and Reliability of Service

> - Reward Period is approximately 24 hours, with Reward submission occurring at approximately 01:30
>   UTC.
> - 5G Hotspots perform periodic Speed Tests which will be considered in reward calculations.
> - Small Cell Radios must generate at least 1 "heartbeat" per 1 hour for any 12 hours in the
>   24-hour Reward Period.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.
- Maintain 100 Mbps or greater Download speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 10 Mbps or greater Upload speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 50ms or lesser Latency on a 6-interval moving average.
- Generate at least 1 "heartbeat" in at least 12 unique hours of the Reward Period.

## Stage 2: 5G Mapper Proof of Coverage

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices designed specifically to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios to
assist in verifying the quality of coverage and their location in a particular hex.

In accordance with [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md) Mobile
Mappers will earn 10% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network.

The transition from “heartbeat” rewards, as in
[Genesis](/5g-on-helium/5g-poc#stage-1-genesis-rewards), to Mapping rewards will not happen
immediately. A transitional period will allow 5G Hotspot Owners with active CBRS Small Cell Radios
to receive both “heartbeat” rewards and rewards for being mapped.

The details on how exactly data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations is
currently in development.

## Stage 3: Additional Methods of Proof of Coverage

Additional methods of 5G Proof of Coverage will emerge. Stay tuned!
