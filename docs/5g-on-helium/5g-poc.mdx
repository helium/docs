# 5G Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof of Coverage” (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and recievers ("Witness") of PoC activity, you can read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](./blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Helium Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

CBRS Small Cell Radios can only operate as transmitters, they are not able to receive incoming data
and "hear" one another directly.

## 5G PoC Roadmap

MOBILE Rewards are given to the Wallet that owns the 5G Hotspot(s) not to the individual 5G
Hotspot(s) themselves, check your Wallet for the MOBILE transaction and your MOBILE Balance.

To qualify for the Genesis rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio must:

- be properly installed
- be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only)
- broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" to the SAS per Reward Period

### Reward Submission Triggered By Time Period

MOBILE Rewards are earned by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot and at least one connected, SAS registered,
CBRS Small Cell Radio in one "lump sum" every roughly 24-hour interval. This system allows a high
tolerance for downtime in infrastructure that is beyond the 5G Hotspot Owner's control.

- 5G Hotspot must heartbeat 1 per Reward Period
- Reward Period is 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC
- reward submission occurs approx 17 hours later, once a day, around 10 am PST

### Rewards Submission Triggered By Consensus Election

MOBILE Rewards are earned by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot and at least one connected, SAS registered,
CBRS Small Cell Radio in one "lump sum" every 1440 block interval.

- 5G Hotspot must heartbeat 1 per Reward Period
- Reward Period is 48 Consensus Elections (1440 blocks)
- reward submission occurs approx 30 minutes later, much closer to the period in which they are
  earned.

### Addition Of Speed Test Data Into Reward Calculation

:::info Future Requirements

Soon, 5G Hotspots will perform periodic speed tests which will be considered in reward calculations.

:::

A minimum Download and Upload speed will be required by each 5g Hotspot to ensure the 5G Hotspot is
providing quality coverage.

- 5G Hotspot must heartbeat 1 per Reward Period.
- 5G Hotspot must meet or exceed minimum Download and Upload speeds when averaged over the Reward
  Period.
- Upload and Download speed tests are averaged over the Reward Period, 5G Hotspots that do not meet
  the minimum requirements are excluded from reward calculations.
- Reward Period is 48 Consensus Elections (1440 blocks)
- reward submission occurs approx 30 minutes later, much closer to the period in which they are
  earned.

### Increase The Frequency Of Rewarding

5G Hotspots will be rewarded for providing consistent coverage with Reward Periods shortened to 2
Epochs (60 blocks). Rewards transactions are triggered with every Consensus Election.

### Decouple Reward Period From Reward Submission Time

This will increase tolerance for delay of heartbeat and speed test data because it will allow
sending rewards for the receipts that came in late.
