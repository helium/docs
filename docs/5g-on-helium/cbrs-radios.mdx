# CBRS Small Cell Radios

Instead of an antenna, Helium 5G Hotspots use Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) Radios to
provide cellular coverage. CBRS is a wide broadcast 3.5Ghz band in the United States that does not
require a tower operator to acquire spectrum licenses.

More information about CBRS can be found on the
[Federal Communications Commission Website](https://www.fcc.gov/35-ghz-band-overview)

5G Hotspots can participate in providing 5G cellular coverage when connected to Indoor or Outdoor
CBRS Small Cell Radios while also participating in providing LoRaWAN coverage.

:::warning

Only certified CBRS Radios provisioned with the FreedomFi firmware will operate when connected to a
5G Hotspot.

CBRS Radios that are not certified and do not use the FreedomFi firmware will not provide 5G
coverage and will not mine MOBILE.

The [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) is the best place to get real-time support from the
community. The [#5g-cbrs](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/836735476659912754)
channel is most relevant for using 5G on the Network.

## Outdoor Small Cell Radios

Outdoor Small Cell Radios are more powerful than Indoor Small Cell Radios and are weatherized to
endure the elements. Outdoor Small Cell Radios create a larger area of 5G coverage while requiring a
bit more planning when installing and maintaining.

Outdoor Small Cell Radios require installation above ground level and require registration with the
Spectrum Access System (SAS) to operate. Please be sure to evaluate your locations and ability to
install these Small Cell Radios, and consider hiring a professional to ensure your installation is
secure and meets all regulatory requirements.

SAS registration is expected to be completed within 5 days of submission, Hotspot Owners will be
contacted via email with a confirmation of successful registration, or with a rejection reply and an
explanation of what needs to be corrected.

## Indoor Small Cell Radios

Indoor Small Cell Radios are less powerful and are ideal for installations such as coffee shops,
bars, grocery stores, etc. Indoor Small Cell Radios are generally easier to install and create a
smaller, localized area of 5G coverage.

Indoor Small Cell Radios are physically smaller radios and can be installed at any height.
Installing an Indoor Small Cell Radio outdoors is not recommended as they are not weather resistant.

## CBRS Radio Troubleshooting

### The 5G Statistics Tab on Explorer

5G Hotspots with attached new tab with status, active or inactive,

Small Cell Status -> A 5G Hotspot is active if it has a heartbeat in the last 10 minutes.

- `Inactive`: could be for several reasons
- `Active`: all is well Small Cell Location -> `Indoor` or `Outdoor`

inactive means no heartbeat in the previous 10 minutes

1. what does inactive mean?
2. where's my other small cell radio attached to the same hotspot?

### Using Multiple Small Cell Radios with a 5G Hotspot

A single 5G Hotspot can support multiple Small Cell Radios but requires an additional network
switch. A soft limit to consider is 7 Small Cell Radios to one 5G Hotspot, however, this limit is
only theoretical as the true limiting factor is bandwidth saturation. All 5G Hotspots are built with
a 1 Gbps Network Interface Card (NIC), the throughput of all the radios combined is limited to 1
Gbps or your internet speed, whichever is lower.

### Spectrum Access `None` Status

A Dynamic Protection Area (DPA) is a geographic region where incumbents (Tier 1 users) get
protection from PAL and GAA interference. Most DPAs are dynamically activated and deactivated based
on incumbent activity. The SAS may need to suspend some or all nearby grants from transmitting so
that interference does not exceed interference margins for each incumbent.

During a DPA event, all Small Cell Radios in the given DPA Neighborhood are disabled by the SAS.
There is nothing that you need or can do in these scenarios.

A message similar to the following may also be present:

```bash
Spectrum Access status went back to “Connected” after it had been working. Wait and don’t reboot.
Suspension can last from hours to days for DPA Events. Contact support if you have been suspended for
more than 48hrs. This is more prevalent if your location is within 150km of the DPA Regions.
```

### Small Cell Radios Need GPS

All compatible CBRS Small Cell Radios use GPS for network timing data and to assert the Small Cell
Radio's location when requesting approval to transmit from the FCC-regulated Spectrum Access System
(SAS).

Small Cell Radios will need to be placed somewhere that allows the GPS antenna to be in a location
with good GPS reception (i.e. near a window). Indoor Small Cell Radios are shipped with an external
GPS antenna that can be positioned indipendently while Outdoor Small Cell Radios have the GPS antena
integrated into the body directly.
