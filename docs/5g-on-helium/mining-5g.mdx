# 5G Mining and MOBILE Rewards

Several factors contribute to how much `MOBILE` a 5G Hotspot will earn over a given period, there
are some higher level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help better
explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these, as well as some mining and token
reward basics.

## How To Mine MOBILE

Mining MOBILE and providing 5G coverage requires a Helium Hotspot and a compatible CBRS Small Cell
Radio. These components can be purchased as a bundle or separately. All 5G Hotspots must be online
and registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System) maintained by the FCC to earn rewards. Specific
instructions can be found during onboarding from individual 5G Hotspot Makers.

:::warning

Misrepresentation of a CBRS radio’s installation information, including GPS location, height,
antenna orientation or other characteristics, in a SAS is a violation of FCC regulations and may
result in fines and/or criminal penalties.

:::

Once the Hotspot is onboarded and Small Cell is physically installed and connected to the Hotspot,
it should automatically appear in the Radio Dashboard on the local IP address.

5G Hotspots will appear on explorer.helium.com between 2-4 days, depending on how quickly it is
registered in the SAS.

### Install Helium Wallet app to manage HNT/MOBILE token.

- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hnt-wallet/id1609525848)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet.app&gl=US)

Once the 5G rewards are activated, and given correct installation, the 5G Hotspot will start earning
MOBILE automatically.

:::tip

Be sure to update the Helium Wallet app to the latest version. More information can be found on the

## Emissions Curve

There will be a max supply of 250B MOBILE with issuance halvenings of every 2 years aligned with the
HNT issuance halvenings. The first halving will occur on August 1, 2023 to align with HNT halving
and will continue on a 2 year cycle afterward.

This allocation is distributed throughout the shortened 1 year period to online 5G Hotspots on an
epochal basis, weighted by Small Cell model.

For clarity, the emission schedule is as follows:

|  Phase  | Weekly Emission |
| :-----: | --------------: |
| Genesis |     640,000,000 |
| 5G PoC  |   1,280,000,000 |

The Helium Foundation will work with the core developers to begin the Genesis period of MOBILE
rewards. This will be paid out of the Foundation's pre-mined MOBILE rewards pool. The rate of
rewards, as defined above, is half that defined in HIP 53 and will be proportionally distributed to
all active 5G radios as described below.

## How Do Hotspots Earn Helium MOBILE Tokens?

The Helium blockchain rewards 5G Hotspots for providing 5G wireless coverage and verifying the
Helium Network. 5G Hotspots are rewarded in the Helium MOBILE Token.

During the Genesis Period, 5G Hotspots will earn MOBILE by reporting their status via a “heartbeat”,
an automatic process of reporting to the Blockchain that the Small Cell Radio is online and
registered with the SAS.

Once your 5G Hotspot is completely deployed and fully synced with the Helium blockchain, you as the
owner are not required to do anything else in order to earn MOBILE. Your 5G Hotspot will perform all
of its activities on its own and will be rewarded for maintaining a valid connection to the SAS.

### Small Cell Radio Model Reward Scaling

All properly installed and registered 5G Hotspots will earn rewards for participating on the
Network. A rewards unit multiple is applied to the various Small Cell Models based on whether they
are indoor or outdoor, as well as their power output, as follows:

| Model           | Reward Scaler |  Small Cell Type   |
| --------------- | :-----------: | :----------------: |
| Nova 436H       |      2x       | High Power Outdoor |
| Nova 430i       |     1.5x      |      Outdoor       |
| Sercomm Outdoor |     1.5x      |      Outdoor       |
| Sercomm Indoor  |      1x       |       Indoor       |
| Neutrino 430    |      1x       |       Indoor       |

Inidividual rewards per period are calculated as a proporation of the total weighted rewards units.

### Indoor Small Cells

These less powerful Small Cell Radios are ideal for indoor installations, such as coffee shops,
bars, grocery stores, etc. Indoor Small Cell Radios are generally easier to install and create a
shorter range, localized area of 5G coverage.

Indoor Small Cell Radios are physically smaller radios and can be installed at any height. It is
Installing an Indoor Small Cell outdoors is not recommended as they are not weather resistant.

### Outdoor Small Cells

These Small Cell Radios are more Powerful than Indoor Small Cell Radios and are typically
weatherized to endure the elements. Outdoor Small Cell Radios create a larger area of 5G coverage
while requiring a bit more planning when installing and maintaining.

Outdoor Small Cells require installation above ground level and require registration with the
Spectrum Access System (SAS) to operate. Please be sure to evaluate your locations and ability to
install these Small Cell Radios, and consider hiring a professional to ensure your installation is
secure and meets all regulatory requirements.

SAS registration is expected to be completed within 24 hours of submission, Hotspot Owners will be
contacted via email with a rejection reply and an explanation of what needs to be corrected.
