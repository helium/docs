# 5G Mining and MOBILE Rewards

Several factors contribute to how much `MOBILE` a 5G Hotspot will earn over a given period, there
are some higher level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help better
explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these, as well as some mining and token
reward basics.

## How To Mine MOBILE

Mining MOBILE and providing 5G coverage requires a 5G Helium Hotspot and a compatible CBRS Small
Cell Radio. These components can be purchased as a bundle or separately. All 5G Hotspots must be
online and registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System) maintained by the FCC to earn MOBILE
rewards.

Instructions on installing a CBRS Small Cell Radio and registration with the SAS is provided by the
individual 5G Hotspot Makers. As an example, see the FreedomFi installation guides as a reference
here:

- [FreedomFi Indoor Install Guide](https://freedomfi.com/freedomfi-indoor-cbrs-small-cell-setup-guide/)
- [FreedomFi Outdoor Install Guide](https://freedomfi.com/freedomfi-outdoor-cbrs-small-cell-setup-guide/)

:::warning

Misrepresentation of a CBRS Radio installation information, including GPS location, height, antenna
orientation or other characteristics, in a SAS is a violation of FCC regulations and may result in
fines and/or criminal penalties.

:::

Once the 5G Hotspot is onboarded and the Small Cell Radio is physically installed, the Small Cell
will automatically initialize and aquire a GPS lock. Once that is complete, the Small Cell Radio
dashboard appear under the "Radio Dashboard" tab on the local IP address.

5G Hotspots will appear on [explorer.helium.com](https://explorer.helium.com/) between 2-4 days,
depending on how quickly it is registered in the SAS.

### Install Helium Wallet app to manage HNT/MOBILE token.

- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hnt-wallet/id1609525848)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet.app&gl=US)

Once the 5G rewards are activated, and given correct installation, the 5G Hotspot will start earning
MOBILE automatically.

:::tip

Be sure to update the Helium Wallet app to the latest version. More information can be found on the

## How Do Hotspots Earn Helium MOBILE Tokens?

The Helium blockchain rewards 5G Hotspots for providing 5G wireless coverage and verifying the
Helium Network. 5G Hotspots are rewarded in the Helium MOBILE Token.

During the Genesis Period, 5G Hotspots will earn MOBILE by reporting their status via a “heartbeat”,
an automatic process of reporting to the Blockchain that the Small Cell Radio is online and
registered with the SAS.

Once your 5G Hotspot is completely deployed and fully synced with the Helium blockchain, you as the
owner are not required to do anything else in order to earn MOBILE. Your 5G Hotspot will perform all
of its activities on its own and will be rewarded for maintaining a valid connection to the SAS.

## Emissions Curve

There will be a max supply of 250B MOBILE with issuance halvenings of every 2 years aligned with the
HNT issuance halvenings. The first halving will occur on August 1, 2023 to align with HNT halving
and will continue on a 2 year cycle afterward. This creates a "stub period" as defined by
[HIP 53: Mobile subDAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md) which will begin
when normal emissions of MOBILE tokens begins (and MOBILE can be redeemed by HNT in the subDAO's
treasury). The date for this is currently TBD and dependent on core developers impelementing the HNT
token treasury and redemption transactions on chain. This is defined as Phase 2 of
[HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) for all new
subDAOs.

Before normal emissions of MOBILE begin,
[HIP 51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) defined an earlier
launch of MOBILE tokens assigning a premine amount of MOBILE to the Helium Foundation. The Helium
Foundation will work with the core developers to begin the Genesis period of MOBILE rewards. Genesis
rewards will be paid out of the Foundation's pre-mined MOBILE rewards pool.

Currently, the Helium Foundation intends to issue 100M tokens per day in the Genesis period and it
will be proportionally distributed to all active 5G Small Cell Radios as described below.

## Small Cell Type Reward Scaling

All properly installed and registered 5G Hotspots will earn rewards for participating on the
Network. A rewards unit multiple is applied to the various Small Cell Models based on whether they
are indoor or outdoor, as well as their power output, as follows:

| Model           | Reward Weight | Small Cell Type    |
| :-------------- | :-----------: | :----------------- |
| Nova 436H       |     2.0x      | High Power Outdoor |
| Nova 430i       |     1.5x      | Outdoor            |
| Sercomm Outdoor |     1.5x      | Outdoor            |
| Sercomm Indoor  |     1.0x      | Indoor             |
| Neutrino 430    |     1.0x      | Indoor             |

Individual rewards per period are calculated as a proportion of the total weighted reward units.

## Earnings Example

Earnings are calculated in 3 steps

1. Calculate the Total Emissions Weight and Emissions Weight Ratio for each Small Cell Type
2. Each Small Cell Type is allocated its ratio of the total rewards in the given epoch
3. Each 5G Hotspot is proportionally rewarded from its respective rewards pool by Small Cell Type

As an example, we can calculate the rewards for a 5G Hotspot in a single epoch assuming the
following (the below numbers are examples and may not reflect actual deployed Hotspots today):

- 100,000 MOBILE Rewarded per epoch
- 100 High Power Outdoor 5H Hotspots earn rewards
- 400 Outdoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 500 Indoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards

### Reward Ratios

Calculate the Total Emissions Weight and Emissions Weight Ratio for each Small Cell Type:

In this example, the Total Emissions Weight it 1,300 and the ratios are as follows (rounded for ease
of understanding)

```bash
  (High Power Outdoor Count * 2.0)    =>    200  =>  200 / 1,300  => 16%
+            (Outdoor Count * 1.5)    =>  + 600  =>  600 / 1,300  => 46%
+             (Indoor Count * 1.0)    =>  + 500  =>  500 / 1,300  => 38%
------------------------------------      ------
                                          1,300
```

### Small Cell Type Pool

Each Small Cell Type is allocated its ratio of the total rewards in the given epoch.

> Small Cell Type Reward Pool = Epoch Rewards \* Weighted Small Cell Type Ratio

```bash
High Power Outdoor  => 100,000 * 16% = 16,000 MOBILE
Outdoor             => 100,000 * 46% = 46,000 MOBILE
Indoor              => 100,000 * 38% = 38,000 MOBILE
```

### Rewards Per 5G Hotspot

Each 5G Hotspot is rewarded from its respective rewards pool by Small Cell Type.

> Reward Per Epoch = Small Cell Type Reward Pool / Number of Small Cell of that Type

```bash
High Power Outdoor  => 16,000 / 100 =  160 MOBILE per 5G Hotspot
Outdoor             => 46,000 / 400 =  115 MOBILE per 5G Hotspot
Indoor              => 38,000 / 500 =   76 MOBILE per 5G Hotspot
```
