# MOBILE Mappers

:::tip Coming Soon

The details on how data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations are currently in
development. Check out how MOBILE Mappers will be included in the the MOBILE PoC Roadmap
[here](https://blog.helium.com/mobile-proof-of-coverage-the-road-ahead-73a25601a13d).

:::

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices explicitly designed to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios to
verify coverage quality and location in a particular hex.

Following [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md), Mobile Mappers will
be eligible to earn 10% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network.
