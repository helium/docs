# MOBILE Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called "Proof of Coverage" (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity; read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](/blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN Network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

:::info **One Way Traffic**

CBRS Small Cell Radios can only operate as transmitters; they cannot receive incoming data and thus
can not "hear" one another directly.

## How To Mine MOBILE

Several factors contribute to the amount of MOBILE a 5G Hotspot will earn over a given period. This
page covers some higher-level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help
better explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these and some mining and token
reward basics.

The Helium Blockchain rewards 5G Hotspots with CBRS Radios for providing 5G wireless coverage and
verifying the Helium Network with the Helium MOBILE Token.

Mining MOBILE and providing 5G coverage requires a 5G Hotspot and one or more compatible CBRS Small
Cell Radios. These components can be purchased as a bundle or separately. All 5G Hotspots must be
online and registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System) maintained by the FCC to earn MOBILE
rewards. Once properly deployed, you, as the owner, are not required to do anything else with your
5G Hotspot to earn MOBILE.

More than one Small Cell Radio can be connected to a single 5G Hotspot to create a larger 5G
coverage area. 5G Hotspots can support as many Small Cell Radios as would saturate their bandwidth.

Connecting more than one Small Cell Radio will require an additional networking switch. Refer to the
5G Hotspot Maker installation guides for specific instructions.

:::info

During [Genesis](./mobile-poc#mobile-genesis), 5G Hotspots earn MOBILE by reporting their status via
a "heartbeat," an automatic reporting process to the Helium Blockchain that the Small Cell Radio is
online and registered with the SAS.

Genesis is the period during which Hotspot owners are rewarded for providing 5G coverage with
pre-mined MOBILE tokens. MOBILE tokens will be redeemable for HNT after the Genesis period ends.

:::

---

## MOBILE Genesis

During Genesis, 100M MOBILE tokens are allocated to be issued per day. This 24-hour Reward Period is
expressed in blocks and aligns as close to the Reward Period time range as possible but may not line
up exactly on 24-hour intervals.

Given this slight differentiation, daily rewards may not equal 100M MOBILE. Check out this
[Example Reward Transaction](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/0n4TO_2W14rrsGt-nxBTotiHFCFukkO04QoXIxaOtAY)
for reference.

To qualify for Genesis Rewards in a given Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be installed appropriately.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

:::note What is a "Heartbeat"?

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that the connected CBRS Small Cell Radio(s)
is authorized to transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds. This
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

## Small Cell Radio Reward Scaling

All 5G Hotspots with properly installed and registered CBRS Radios will earn rewards for
participating on the Network. A rewards unit multiple is applied to the various Small Cell Radio
models based on whether they are indoor or outdoor, as well as their power output, as follows:

| Small Cell Radio Type | Reward Weight |
| --------------------- | :-----------: |
| High Power Outdoor\*  |    `4.000`    |
| Outdoor               |    `2.500`    |
| Indoor                |    `1.000`    |

> \*Currently, the only High-Power Outdoor Radio is the `Baicells Nova436H.`

Individual rewards per period are calculated as a proportion of the total weighted reward units.

### Earnings Example

Earnings are calculated in 3 steps.

1. Calculate the Total Emissions Weight and Emissions Weight Ratio for each Small Cell Radio Type
2. Each Small Cell Radio Type is allocated its ratio of the total rewards in the given epoch
3. Each 5G Hotspot is proportionally rewarded from its respective rewards pool by Small Cell Radio
   Type

:::caution

As an example, we can calculate the rewards for a 5G Hotspot in a single epoch assuming the
following (the below numbers are examples and may not reflect actual deployed 5G Hotspots today):

- 100,000,000 MOBILE Rewarded per day
- 150 High-Power Outdoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 800 Outdoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 1,400 Indoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 1 Small Cell Radio per 5G Hotspot (in real-world usage, multiple Small Cell Radios can be
  connected to a 5G Hotspot)

:::

## Total Rewards Units for Epoch

Calculate the Total Reward Points for a given epoch using the Reward Weight for each Small Cell
Radio type.

In this example, the total rewards Points per epoch is 4,000, and the ratios are as follows:

```bash
  High-Power Outdoor Count (  150) * 4.0    =>      600   =>  0.15
+            Outdoor Count (  800) * 2.5    =>  + 2,000   =>  0.50
+             Indoor Count (1,400) * 1.0    =>  + 1,400   =>  0.35
-----------------------------------------       --------
                                                  4,000
```

### Earnings per Small Cell Radio

Each Small Cell Radio is allocated its rewards based on the reward weight of the model.

> Small Cell Reward = Daily Rewards \* Reward Weight / Count of Small Cell Type

```bash
High-Power Outdoor  => 100,000,000 * 0.15 /   150 = 100,000 MOBILE per day
           Outdoor  => 100,000,000 * 0.50 /   800 =  62,500 MOBILE per day
            Indoor  => 100,000,000 * 0.35 / 1,400 =  25,000 MOBILE per day
```

## Speed Tests and Quality of Service

:::caution Coming Soon

Speed Test metrics are not yet included in Rewards calculations.

:::

A 5G Hotspot will automatically perform a Speed Test approximately every 12 hours, with the results
averaged by the MOBILE PoC Oracle.

Soon, the MOBILE PoC Oracle will include these Speed Test metrics in the Rewards calculations for
each 5G Hotspot.

The "Moving Average," also known as a "Rolling Average," is the average of at least `2` but no more
than `6` most recent Speed Test results for each download, upload, and latency for a given 5G
Hotspot.

Additionally, the Moving Average resets following a Speed Test gap of `>12 hours,` and a new series
of Speed Test results must be collected before a Moving Average can be calculated.

### Tiered Speed Test

In response to community feedback and further exploration by Chris from DeWiPulse for his
[analysis of and commentary on public Internet data in the United States,](https://dewipulse.com/connectivity-where-it-matters/)
Speed Test results are categorized into one of four Tiers.

| Speed Test Tier | Reward Multiplier | Requirement (speeds in Mbps, latency in ms)                  |
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acceptable**  |      `1.00x`      | `100+` Download, **AND** `10+` Upload, **AND** `<50` Latency |
|  **Degraded**   |      `0.50x`      | `50+` Download, **AND** `5+` Upload, **AND** `<75` Latency   |
|    **Poor**     |      `0.25x`      | `30+` Download, **AND** `2+` Upload, **AND** `<100` Latency  |
|    **Fail**     |      `0.00x`      | `<30` Download, **OR** `<2` Upload, **OR** `>100` Latency    |

:::note Why are Hotspots with slower speeds being rewarded at all?

Many locations where CBRS connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always
have the high-speed Internet connectivity needed to meet the acceptable Internet requirements for
Genesis rewards consistently.

Often these areas don't have good cellular coverage either. That's why we believe it is essential to
incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

:::

:::warning **backhaul requirements will evolve**

As the needs and realities of the 5G Hotspot network change, Internet backhaul requirements will
evolve to better suit the Network and its users.

:::

### Speed Test Tier Reward Scaling

Tiered Speed Test values introduce a new multiplier to the Rewards calculations.

- Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minimum value of each Download, Upload, and
  Latency (logical `AND`).
- Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload, or Latency
  are considered to have `Failed` and are not eligible for Rewards until the Speed Test Average is
  improved (logical `OR`).

When combined with existing
[Small Cell Type Reward Scale Mulitpliers](/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc#small-cell-radio-reward-scaling)
the Rewards Scaling Table is as follows:

| Small Cell Radio Type | Acceptable | Degraded |  Poor   |  Fail   |
| --------------------- | :--------: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| High Power Outdoor    |  `4.000`   | `2.000`  | `1.000` | `0.000` |
| Outdoor               |  `2.500`   | `1.250`  | `0.625` | `0.000` |
| Indoor                |  `1.000`   | `0.500`  | `0.250` | `0.000` |

**Example 1: All Acceptable**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload       40 ->  `Acceptable`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Acceptable`  -> 1.0x Multiplier
```

**Example 2: Degraded Upload**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload        6 ->  `Degraded`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Degraded`    -> 0.5x Multiplier
```

**Example 3: Poor Download, Degraded Upload**

```bash
Download     40 ->  `Poor`
Upload        6 ->  `Degraded`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Poor`        -> 0.25x Multiplier
```

**Example 4: Failed Latency**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload       40 ->  `Acceptable`
Latency     150 ->  `Fail`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Fail`        -> 0.0x Multiplier
```

## Future Roadmap

### Heartbeats and Reliability of Service

To encourage reliable signal availability, 5G Hotspots and connected CBRS Small Cell Radios must:

- Be installed appropriately.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- **Generate at least 1 "heartbeat" per 1 hour for any 12 hours in the 24-hour Reward Period.**
- Meet minimum backhaul Speed Test requirements.

### MOBILE Mappers

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices explicitly designed to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios to
verify coverage quality and location in a particular hex.

Following [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md), Mobile Mappers will
earn 10% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network.

The transition from "heartbeat" rewards, as in [Genesis](/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc#mobile-genesis),
to Mapping rewards will not happen immediately. Instead, a transitional period will allow 5G Hotspot
Owners with active CBRS Small Cell Radios to receive both "heartbeat" rewards and rewards for being
mapped.

The details on how data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations are currently in
development.
