# MOBILE Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof of Coverage” (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity, read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](/blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

**One Way Traffic**

CBRS Small Cell Radios can only operate as transmitters, they are not able to receive incoming data
and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

## Current MOBILE PoC Reward Elegibility

MOBILE Rewards are earned by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot and at least one connected, SAS registered,
CBRS Small Cell Radio in one "lump sum" every roughly 24-hour interval. This system allows a high
tolerance for downtime in infrastructure that is beyond the 5G Hotspot Owner's control.

To qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

:::note What is a "Heartbeat"?

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that the connected CBRS Small Cell Radio(s)
is authorized to transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds, this
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

## Stage 1: Genesis Rewards

** Reward Targets:**

During Genesis, 100M Mobile tokens are allocated to be issued per day. This 24-hour Reward Period is
expressed in blocks, and aligns as close to the Reward Period time range as possible, but may not
line up _exactly_ on 24-hour intervals.

Given this slight differentiation, daily rewards may not equate to an exact 100M MOBILE. Check out
this
[Example Reward Transaction](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/0n4TO_2W14rrsGt-nxBTotiHFCFukkO04QoXIxaOtAY)
for reference.

### Genesis Phase 1: Time Period Triggered Rewards

> - Reward Period is approximately 1440 blocks and closely aligns with 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC.
> - Reward submission occurs approx 17 hours later, once a day, around 17:00 UTC.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

### Genesis Phase 2: Time Period Triggered Rewards with Minimum Delay

:::info

This is the Current Phase as of August 29, 2022

:::

> - Reward Period is approximately 1440 blocks and closely aligns with 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC.
> - Reward submission occurs approx 15 minutes after the Reward Period ends, around 00:00 UTC.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

### Genesis Phase 3: Speed Tests and Quality of Service

> - Reward Period is approximately 24 hours, with Reward submission occurring at approximately 01:30
>   UTC.
> - 5G Hotspots perform periodic Speed Tests which will be considered in reward calculations.
> - A minimum Download speed, Upload speed, and Latency will be required by each 5G Hotspot to
>   ensure it is providing quality coverage.

A 5G Hotspot is determined to be providing `Acceptable` coverage as outlined in
[HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#oracle-operations), when it
maintains a rolling average Download speed of at least 100Mbps **AND** a rolling average Upload
speed of at least 10Mbps **AND** a rolling average Latency of 50ms or less.

**Tiered Speed Test:**

In response to community feedback and further exploration by Chris from DeWiPulse for his
[analysis of and commentary on public Internet data in the United States](https://dewipulse.com/connectivity-where-it-matters/)
Speed Test results are categorized into four Tiers.

| Speed Test Tier | Reward Multiplier |                  Requirement (speeds in Mbps)                  |
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  `Acceptable`   |       1.00x       | `100+` Download, **AND** `10+` Upload, **AND** `<50ms` Latency |
|   `Degraded`    |       0.50x       |  `50+` Download, **AND** `5+` Upload, **AND** `<75ms` Latency  |
|     `Poor`      |       0.25x       | `30+` Download, **AND** `2+` Upload, **AND** `<100ms` Latency  |
|     `Fail`      |       0.00x       |  `<30` Download, **OR** `<2` Upload, **OR** `>100ms` Latency   |

:::info Why are Hotspots with slower speeds being rewarded at all?

Many locations where CBRS connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always
have the Internet high-speed connectivity needed to always meet the acceptable Internet requirements
for Genesis rewards.

Often these areas don't have good cellular coverage either. That's why we believe it is important to
incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

:::

**Tiered Speed Test values introduce a new multiplier to the Genesis Rewards calculations:**

A 5G Hotspot will automatically perform a Speed Test approximately every 12 hours with the results
being averaged by the MOBILE PoC Oracle over the previous `6` tests, depending on the availability
of the data. This moving average is reset following a speed test gap of `>12 hours` and a minimum of
`2` Speed Test results are required to be eligible for Genesis Rewards.

- Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minumum Tier of each Download, Upload and
  Latency. (logical `AND`)
- Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload or Latency
  are considered to have `Failed` and are not eligible for Genesis Rewards until the Speed Test
  Average is improved. (logical `OR`)

**Example 1: All Acceptable**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload       40 ->  `Acceptable`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Acceptable`  -> 1.0x Multiplier
```

**Example 2: Degraded Upload**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload        6 ->  `Degraded`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Degraded`    -> 0.5x Multiplier
```

**Example 3: Failed Latency**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload       40 ->  `Acceptable`
Latency     150 ->  `Fail`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Fail`        -> 0.0x Multiplier
```

When combined with existing
[Small Cell Type Reward Scale Mulitpliers](./mining-mobile#small-cell-radio-reward-scaling) the
Rewards Scaling Table is as follows:

| Speed Test         | Acceptable | Degraded |  Poor   |  Fail   |
| ------------------ | :--------: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| High Power Outdoor |  `4.000`   | `2.000`  | `1.000` | `0.000` |
| Outdoor            |  `2.500`   | `1.250`  | `0.625` | `0.000` |
| Indoor             |  `1.000`   | `0.500`  | `0.250` | `0.000` |

:::note Moving Average

The "Moving Average", also known as a "Rolling Average", is the average of at least 2 but no more
than 6 most recent speed test results for each download, upload, and latency.

This means that when more than 6 Speed Test results are available, results that came before 6th most
recent test won't be considered in the calculation.

:::

#### Example Calculation Tables

Here are a set of tables to help visualize all of these components that make up the Speed Test
result.

:::info

Note that it may take up to 12 hours for newly connected 5G Hotspots to perform a Speed Test and a
minimum of 2 Speed Tests are required for the MOBILE PoC Oracle to calculate a moving average.

### Genesis Phase 4: Heartbeats and Reliability of Service

> - Reward Period is approximately 24 hours, with Reward submission occurring at approximately 01:30
>   UTC.
> - 5G Hotspots perform periodic Speed Tests which will be considered in reward calculations.
> - Small Cell Radios must generate at least 1 "heartbeat" per 1 hour for any 12 hours in the
>   24-hour Reward Period.

At this Milestone, to qualify for the Genesis Rewards in a Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio
must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.
- Maintain 100 Mbps or greater Download speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 10 Mbps or greater Upload speeds on a 6-interval moving average.
- Maintain 50ms or lesser Latency on a 6-interval moving average.
- Generate at least 1 "heartbeat" in at least 12 unique hours of the Reward Period.

## Stage 2: 5G Mapper Proof of Coverage

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices designed specifically to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios to
assist in verifying the quality of coverage and their location in a particular hex.

In accordance with [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md) Mobile
Mappers will earn 10% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network.

The transition from “heartbeat” rewards, as in
[Genesis](/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc#stage-1-genesis-rewards), to Mapping rewards will not happen
immediately. A transitional period will allow 5G Hotspot Owners with active CBRS Small Cell Radios
to receive both “heartbeat” rewards and rewards for being mapped.

The details on how exactly data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations is
currently in development.

## Stage 3: Additional Methods of Proof of Coverage

Additional methods of 5G Proof of Coverage will emerge. Stay tuned!
