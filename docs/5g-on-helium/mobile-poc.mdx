# MOBILE Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof of Coverage” (PoC) to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity, read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](/blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

:::info **One Way Traffic**

CBRS Small Cell Radios can only operate as transmitters, they are not able to receive incoming data
and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

:::

MOBILE Rewards are earned as one "lump sum" by a Wallet with a 5G Hotspot with at least one
connected, SAS registered, CBRS Small Cell Radio every roughly 24-hour interval. This allows a high
tolerance for downtime in infrastructure that is beyond the 5G Hotspot Owner's control.

---

## MOBILE Genesis

During Genesis, 100M MOBILE tokens are allocated to be issued per day. This 24-hour Reward Period is
expressed in blocks, and aligns as close to the Reward Period time range as possible, but may not
line up exactly on 24-hour intervals.

Given this slight differentiation, daily rewards may not equate to an exact 100M MOBILE. Check out
this
[Example Reward Transaction](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/0n4TO_2W14rrsGt-nxBTotiHFCFukkO04QoXIxaOtAY)
for reference.

To qualify for Genesis Rewards in a given Reward Period, a CBRS Small Cell Radio must:

- Be connected to a 5G Hotspot.
- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- Broadcast at least 1 "heartbeat" per Reward Period.

:::note What is a "Heartbeat"?

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that the connected CBRS Small Cell Radio(s)
is authorized to transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds, this
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

## Speed Tests and Quality of Service

:::caution Coming Soon

Speed Test metrics are not yet included in Rewards calculations.

:::

A 5G Hotspot will automatically perform a Speed Test approximately every 12 hours with the results
being averaged by the MOBILE PoC Oracle.

Soon, the MOBILE PoC Oracle will include these Speed Test metrics in the Rewards calculations for
each 5G Hotspot.

The "Moving Average", also known as a "Rolling Average", is the average of at least `2` but no more
than `6` most recent Speed Test results for each download, upload, and latency for a given 5G
Hotspot.

Additionally, the Moving Average is reset following a Speed Test gap of `>12 hours` and a new series
of Speed Test results must be collected before a Moving Average can be calculated.

### Tiered Speed Test

In response to community feedback and further exploration by Chris from DeWiPulse for his
[analysis of and commentary on public Internet data in the United States](https://dewipulse.com/connectivity-where-it-matters/)
Speed Test results are categorized into one of four Tiers.

| Speed Test Tier | Reward Multiplier | Requirement (speeds in Mbps, latency in ms)                  |
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acceptable**  |      `1.00x`      | `100+` Download, **AND** `10+` Upload, **AND** `<50` Latency |
|  **Degraded**   |      `0.50x`      | `50+` Download, **AND** `5+` Upload, **AND** `<75` Latency   |
|    **Poor**     |      `0.25x`      | `30+` Download, **AND** `2+` Upload, **AND** `<100` Latency  |
|    **Fail**     |      `0.00x`      | `<30` Download, **OR** `<2` Upload, **OR** `>100` Latency    |

:::note Why are Hotspots with slower speeds being rewarded at all?

Many locations where CBRS connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always
have the Internet high-speed connectivity needed to always meet the acceptable Internet requirements
for Genesis rewards.

Often these areas don't have good cellular coverage either. That's why we believe it is important to
incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

:::

:::warning **backhaul requirements will evolve**

As the needs and realities of the 5G Hotspot network change, Internet backhaul requirements will
evolve to better suit the network and its users.

:::

### Speed Test Tier Reward Scaling

Tiered Speed Test values introduce a new multiplier to the Rewards calculations.

- Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minimum value of each Download, Upload and
  Latency (logical `AND`).
- Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload, or Latency
  are considered to have `Failed` and are not eligible for Rewards until the Speed Test Average is
  improved (logical `OR`).

When combined with existing
[Small Cell Type Reward Scale Mulitpliers](./mining-mobile#small-cell-radio-reward-scaling) the
Rewards Scaling Table is as follows:

| Speed Test         | Acceptable | Degraded |  Poor   |  Fail   |
| ------------------ | :--------: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| High Power Outdoor |  `4.000`   | `2.000`  | `1.000` | `0.000` |
| Outdoor            |  `2.500`   | `1.250`  | `0.625` | `0.000` |
| Indoor             |  `1.000`   | `0.500`  | `0.250` | `0.000` |

**Example 1: All Acceptable**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload       40 ->  `Acceptable`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Acceptable`  -> 1.0x Multiplier
```

**Example 2: Degraded Upload**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload        6 ->  `Degraded`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Degraded`    -> 0.5x Multiplier
```

**Example 3: Poor Download, Degraded Upload**

```bash
Download     40 ->  `Poor`
Upload        6 ->  `Degraded`
Latency      15 ->  `Acceptable`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Poor`        -> 0.25x Multiplier
```

**Example 4: Failed Latency**

```bash
Download    200 ->  `Acceptable`
Upload       40 ->  `Acceptable`
Latency     150 ->  `Fail`
---------------------------------
Speed Test Tier ->  `Fail`        -> 0.0x Multiplier
```

### Example Calculation Tables

Here are a set of tables to help visualize all of these components that make up the Speed Test
result.

:::info

Note that it may take up to 12 hours for newly connected 5G Hotspots to perform a Speed Test and a
minimum of 2 Speed Tests are required for the MOBILE PoC Oracle to calculate a moving average.

:::

**Successful Speed Test:**

This 5G Hotspot is passing all Speed Test metrics and is providing a high-quality connection.

results of Tests 7 and later are the most recent.

---

**Missing Multiple Speed Tests:**

This 5G Hotspot has not reported Speed Test data during Test 5, 6, or 7. This is often a result of a
5G Hotspot being disconnected from the Internet for a long time.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-many-miss.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 is the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 4**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 4 are the most recent.

**Test 5 through 8**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Tests 5 through 8 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

results of Tests 2 and later are the most recent.

---

**Multiple Sub-Optimal Speed Tests:**

This 5G Hotspot has less than `Acceptable` Speed Tests in Tests 3, 4, 5, and 6. This has caused the
Moving Average to fall for Tests 6, 7, and 8.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-many-fail.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results

**Test 2 through 5**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 5 are the most recent.

**Test 6 through 8**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **half** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 6 through 8 are the most recent as at least one Speed Test metric Moving Average
has not met or exceeded the required values.

**Test 9 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 9 and later are the most recent.

## Future Roadmap

Additional methods of MOBILE Proof of Coverage will emerge. Stay tuned!

### Heartbeats and Reliability of Service

To encourage reliable signal availability, 5G Hotspots and connected CBRS Small Cell Radios must:

- Be properly installed.
  - Be registered with the SAS (Outdoor Radios Only).
- **Gnerate at least 1 "heartbeat" per 1 hour for any 12 hours in the 24-hour Reward Period.**
- Meet minimum backhaul Speed Test requirements.

### MOBILE Mappers

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices designed specifically to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios to
assist in verifying the quality of coverage and their location in a particular hex.

In accordance with [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md) Mobile
Mappers will earn 10% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network.

The transition from “heartbeat” rewards, as in [Genesis](/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc#mobile-genesis),
to Mapping rewards will not happen immediately. A transitional period will allow 5G Hotspot Owners
with active CBRS Small Cell Radios to receive both “heartbeat” rewards and rewards for being mapped.

The details on how data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations are currently in
development.
