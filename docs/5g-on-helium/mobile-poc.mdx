# MOBILE Proof of Coverage

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called "Proof of Coverage" ("PoC") to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity; read more here:
[Proof of Coverage](/blockchain/proof-of-coverage)

While all current 5G Hotspot models _also_ participate in the LoRaWAN Network and PoC, the CBRS
Small Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

A CBRS Small Cell Radio ("Radio") can only operate as a transmitter; they cannot receive incoming
data and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

## Proof of Coverage Milestones

Determining useful coverage and the impact on MOBILE PoC rewards will be based on a number of
factors:

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc-milestones.png')} />

These factors will be rolled out in stages over the next twelve months and explained in detail to
ensure Network Builders can take concrete steps to plan or improve their setups. Check out the
MOBILE PoC Roadmap
[here](https://blog.helium.com/mobile-proof-of-coverage-the-road-ahead-73a25601a13d).

## Modeled Coverage

With the [passing](https://heliumvote.com/14jH67zhctwb3B5NmwiAjaXQuyF7jZMZCAnfyBYhSpRS3L22sQE) of
[HIP-74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md) the
Core Devs will implement a new Modeled Coverage Oracle on the Helium Network to replace the current
algorithm for MOBILE Rewards initially introduced based on the Radio Type multipliers.

This new algorithm uses the location of the Radio to calculate MOBILE Rewards based on the number of
res12 hexes receiving coverage from a given Radio by considering the directionality of Radios and
environmental obstructions that prevent the propagation of the signals they generate. Modeled
Coverage, combined with other parameters like uptime ("heartbeats") and backhaul ("speed tests"),
aims to allow for more appropriate Rewards and incentivizes the deployment of Radios at optimal
locations.

## Uptime Heartbeats

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that a connected Radio is authorized to
transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds. This
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

To encourage reliable signal availability, 5G Hotspots and connected CBRS Small Cell Radios must
generate at least one heartbeat per hour in 12 unique hours of the 24-hour Reward Period.

### Heartbeat Reward Scaling

:::info Heartbeat impact on Radio rewards

Each Radio is given a `heartbeat multiplier` of either `0` or `1`.

:::

Each Radio is awarded 1 point for a successful heartbeat in each hour, with a maximum of 24 points
in the Reward Period. All Radios with at least 12 points in the 24-hour Reward Period are given a
`heartbeat multiplier` of `1` and will be eligible to earn MOBILE Rewards.

## Backhaul Speed Tests

A 5G Hotspot automatically performs Speed Tests, with the results averaged by the MOBILE PoC Oracle.
The MOBILE PoC Oracle includes these Speed Test metrics in the Rewards calculations for each 5G
Hotspot.

The 5G Hotspot will randomly measure download, upload, and latency to the MOBILE verifier twice in a
given 24-hour period. If a test can not complete successfully, the 5G Hotspot automatically retries
every 30 minutes until a Speed Test is successful. The first Speed Test for a newly installed 5G
Hotspot is performed within the first 12 hours after powering it on.

A minimum of two and maximum of six Speed Tests are required in the previous 48 hours to calculate a
Moving average results for each download, upload, and latency, after which a new series of Speed
Test results must be collected before a Moving Average can be calculated.

### Speed Test Tiers

Many locations where CBRS connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always
have the high-speed Internet connectivity needed to meet the acceptable Internet requirements for
Genesis rewards consistently.

Often these areas do not have good cellular coverage either. That's why we believe it is essential
to incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

### Speed Test Reward Scaling

:::info Speed test impact on Radio rewards

Each 5G Hotspot is given a `speedtest multiplier` of either `0.0`, `0.25`, `0.5` or `1.0`.

This multiplier is applied to all connected Radios in rewards calculations.

:::

In response to community feedback and further exploration by Chris from DeWiPulse for his
[analysis of and commentary on public Internet data in the United States,](https://dewipulse.com/connectivity-where-it-matters/)
Speed Test results are categorized into one of four Tiers.

| Speed Test Tier | Speedtest Multiplier | Requirement (speeds in Mbps, latency in ms)                  |
| :-------------: | :------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acceptable**  |       `1.00x`        | `100+` Download, **AND** `10+` Upload, **AND** `<50` Latency |
|  **Degraded**   |       `0.50x`        | `50+` Download, **AND** `5+` Upload, **AND** `<75` Latency   |
|    **Poor**     |       `0.25x`        | `30+` Download, **AND** `2+` Upload, **AND** `<100` Latency  |
|    **Fail**     |       `0.00x`        | `<30` Download, **OR** `<2` Upload, **OR** `>100` Latency    |

Tiered Speed Test values are used as a multiplier in Rewards calculations as follows:

- Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minimum value of each Download, Upload, and
  Latency (logical `AND`).
- Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload, or Latency
  are considered to have `Failed` and are not eligible for Rewards until the Speed Test Average is
  improved (logical `OR`).

### Requirements Will Evolve

As the needs and realities of the Network change, backhaul requirements will evolve to better suit
the Network and its users.

---

## Radio Earnings Calculation

Earnings are calculated in 3 steps.

1. Calculate the Total Emissions Weight and Emissions Weight Ratio for each Small Cell Radio Type
2. Each Small Cell Radio Type is allocated its ratio of the total rewards in the given epoch
3. Each 5G Hotspot is proportionally rewarded from its respective rewards pool by Small Cell Radio
   Type

:::caution

As an example, we can calculate the rewards for a 5G Hotspot in a single epoch assuming the
following (the below numbers are examples and may not reflect actual deployed 5G Hotspots today):

- 100,000,000 MOBILE Rewarded per day
- 310 High-Power Outdoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 2,000 Outdoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 3,360 Indoor 5G Hotspots earn rewards
- 1 Small Cell Radio per 5G Hotspot (in real-world usage, multiple Small Cell Radios can be
  connected to a 5G Hotspot)

:::

## Total Rewards Units for Epoch

Calculate the Total Reward Points for a given epoch using the Reward Weight for each Small Cell
Radio type.

In this example, the total rewards Points per epoch is 7,000, and the ratios are as follows:

```bash
  High-Power Outdoor Count Acceptable ( 250) * 4.0 * 1.00   =>     1000   =>  0.143
+ High-Power Outdoor Count Degraded   (  50) * 4.0 * 0.50   =>  +   100   =>  0.014
+ High-Power Outdoor Count Poor       (  10) * 4.0 * 0.25   =>  +    10   =>  0.001
+            Outdoor Count Acceptable (1100) * 2.5 * 1.00   =>  +  2750   =>  0.393
+            Outdoor Count Degraded   ( 500) * 2.5 * 0.50   =>  +   625   =>  0.089
+            Outdoor Count Poor       ( 400) * 2.5 * 0.25   =>  +   250   =>  0.036
+             Indoor Count Acceptable (1500) * 1.0 * 1.00   =>  +  1500   =>  0.214
+             Indoor Count Degraded   (1200) * 1.0 * 0.50   =>  +   600   =>  0.086
+             Indoor Count Poor       ( 660) * 1.0 * 0.25   =>  +   165   =>  0.024
---------------------------------------------------------       --------
                                                                  7,000
```

### Earnings per Small Cell Radio

Each Small Cell Radio is allocated its rewards based on the reward weight of the model.

> Small Cell Reward = Daily Rewards \* Reward Weight / Count of Small Cell Type

```bash
High-Power Outdoor Acceptable => 100,000,000 * 0.143 /  250 = 57,142.86 MOBILE per day
High-Power Outdoor Degraded   => 100,000,000 * 0.014 /   50 = 28,571.43 MOBILE per day
High-Power Outdoor Poor       => 100,000,000 * 0.001 /   10 = 14,285.71 MOBILE per day
           Outdoor Acceptable => 100,000,000 * 0.393 / 1100 = 35,714.29 MOBILE per day
           Outdoor Degraded   => 100,000,000 * 0.089 /  500 = 17,857.14 MOBILE per day
           Outdoor Poor       => 100,000,000 * 0.036 /  400 =  8,928.57 MOBILE per day
            Indoor Acceptable => 100,000,000 * 0.214 / 1500 = 14,285.71 MOBILE per day
            Indoor Degraded   => 100,000,000 * 0.086 / 1200 =  7,142.86 MOBILE per day
            Indoor Poor       => 100,000,000 * 0.024 /  660 =  3,571.43 MOBILE per day
```

### Example Calculation Tables

Here are a set of tables to help visualize the components that make up the Speed Test result.

:::info

It may take up to 12 hours for newly connected 5G Hotspots to perform a Speed Test, and a minimum of
2 Speed Tests are required for the MOBILE PoC Oracle to calculate a moving average.

:::

**Successful Speed Test:**

This 5G Hotspot is passing all Speed Test metrics and is providing a high-quality connection.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-success.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of these are the most recent.

---

**Missing A Single Speed Test:**

This 5G Hotspot has not reported Speed Test data at Test 5.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-one-miss.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 4**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 4 are the most recent.

**Test 5 through 6**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Tests 5 through 6 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 7 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 7 and later are the most recent.

---

**Missing Multiple Speed Tests:**

This 5G Hotspot has not reported Speed Test data during Test 5, 6, or 7. This is often a result of a
5G Hotspot being disconnected from the Internet for a long time.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-many-miss.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 4**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 4 are the most recent.

**Test 5 through 8**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Tests 5 through 8 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 9 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 9 and later are the most recent.

---

**Failing A Speed Test:**

This 5G Hotspot has failed its Speed Test on all metrics in Test 6, but the Moving Average stays
within the passing range.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-one-fail.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 and later are the most recent.

---

**Multiple Sub-Optimal Speed Tests:**

This 5G Hotspot has less than `Acceptable` Speed Tests in Tests 3, 4, 5, and 6. This has caused the
Moving Average to fall for Tests 6, 7, and 8.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-many-fail.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 5**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 5 are the most recent.

**Test 6 through 8**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **half** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 6 through 8 are the most recent as at least one Speed Test metric Moving Average
has not met or exceeded the required values.

**Test 9 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 9 and later are the most recent.

### MOBILE Mappers

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices explicitly designed to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios to
verify coverage quality and location in a particular hex.

Following [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md), Mobile Mappers will
be eligible to earn 10% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network.

The transition from "heartbeat" rewards, as in [Genesis](/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc#mobile-genesis),
to Mapping rewards will not happen immediately. Instead, a transitional period will allow 5G Hotspot
Owners with active CBRS Small Cell Radios to receive both "heartbeat" rewards and rewards for being
mapped.

The details on how data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations are currently in
development.
