# Blockchain API

## Endpoints

The Helium [blockchain API](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http) serves up
the blockchain from a database that is filled by a
[blockchain node](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) that populates the
database as blocks come in.

While anyone can run a node and a corresponding API, the Helium hosted version
offers up the API through two endpoints.

- **https://api.helium.wtf** — Beta, scalable endpoint for new features and
  tests. Currently connected to mainnet. This endpoint is used for feature
  development. Submitted transactions may get dropped.
- **https://api.helium.io** — Stable, scalable production service. Connected to
  mainnet.

## Routes

The API routes are grouped together in sub-pages of this page. Refer to the
subpages for details.

## Cursors

In order to return data quickly and reduce the load on the API, a `cursor` may
be returned from an API request. The documentation for each route will indicate
whether the result is paged with a cursor.

In order to request the next page of results, add a cursor URL parameter to the URL that
was used to make the first request.

For example:

```text
export API_URL=https://api.helium.io
http get $(API_URL)/v1/blocks
```

will return a `data` array with _zero or more_ block results and a `cursor`
field. To request the next page:

```text
http get $(API_URL)/v1/blocks?cursor=eyJiZWZvcmUiOjQzOTIwMX0
```

Which will return the next page of results and a next `cursor` for the following
page.

:::info
In order to improve caching the API may return an empty data array and a
cursor. Use the cursor to request more data.
