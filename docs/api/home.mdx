# Helium APIs

The Helium Network currently exposes the following APIs:

- [Blockchain API](/api/blockchain/introduction) - Access real-time and historical data from the
  helium blockchain.
- [Console API](/api/console) - Provides programatic access to your organization's sensor data on
  Helium console instances.

  Note: the free to use Foundation Console [console.helium.com](https://console.helium.com) does not
  support the Console API.

  Console providors that do support the Console API are found at
  [Console Hosting Providers](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/hosting-providers)
