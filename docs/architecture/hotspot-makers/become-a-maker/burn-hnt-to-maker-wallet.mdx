# Burning HNT to Your Maker Wallet

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

Any [approved Hotspot Maker](/network-iot/hotspots-iot/full-hotspots) is responsible for supplying
Data Credits (DCs) to the onboarding server for Hotspots they sell. They do this by burning HNT to
their specific maker address.

A full list of approved maker wallet addresses
[can be seen via this API](https://onboarding.dewi.org/api/v2/makers).

## Maker Wallet Address Integration

As an approved Maker, you will supply the Helium Foundation with the onboarding details for all the
Hotspots you manufacture and distribute. In turn, the Helium Foundation adds them to the onboarding
server. When a Hotspot is onboarded by your end customer, the onboarding server knows to associate
it with your Maker ID, and associated Maker Wallet address. If, when a Hotspot is onboarded, it's
present in the onboarding server and you have ample Data Credits to pay the onboarding fees, the
blockchain will add the Hotspot. And if you've integrated your Hotspot in the Hotspot App
[onboarding flow](/hotspot-makers/become-a-maker/hotspot-integration-testing), the Wallet knows to
use your approved Maker Wallet address. At this point, the Data Credits will be used for the
transactions with your wallet address as the payer.

## Hotspot Data Credit Fees

In order for any Hotspot to join the Helium Blockchain, its maker address must have sufficient Data
Credits. A full list of
[Helium blockchain data credit fees can be found here](/iot/transaction-fees). Hotspot Makers need
to account for at least `5,135,000` total Data Credits per Hotspot. Specifically, for each Hotspot,
a Maker must supply:

- `4,000,000` Data Credits for the **Add Hotspot** transaction. This is a one-time fee.
- `65,000` Data Credits for the transaction fee to execute the **Add Hotspot** transaction.
- `1,000,000` Data Credits for the **Assert Location** transaction. Each Hotspot Maker is required
  to supply at least one \*_Assert Location_ for their Hotspots.
- `70,000` Data Credits for the transaction fee to execute the **Assert Location** transaction.

As a Maker, if you only supply the one-time **Add Hotspot** fee and one **Assert Location** fee,
you'll supply `5,135,000` total Data Credits per Hotspot. Add `1,070,000` Data Credits for each
additional **Assert Location** fee you wish to supply.

:::warning

If your wallet address does not have enough DCs to pay the required Hotspot transaction fees, these
transactions will fail.

## Maker Integration Test Wallet Address

During your testing, you can use the Maker Integration Test wallet address created by the Helium
Foundation. This wallet does not contain any Data Credits so onboarding transactions will fail but
it allows you to smoke test the onboarding steps.

## Burning HNT to Supply Data Credits

:::warning Double-check any wallet address before executing any HNT burn.

Once you burn HNT to a specified wallet address, they are burned forever. The resulting DC are
non-transferable.

:::

The actual mechanism for burning HNT to DCs is via an on-chain burn transaction using the
[Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). Follow the instructions to download and install the
Helium Wallet on your device. Once installed, you'll
[use the "Swap" interface](/hotspot-makers/become-a-maker/funding-a-maker-account) to supply data
credits to your specified Maker wallet, which should be specified as the Recipient wallet.

:::warning

Do not send HNT into your Maker accounts. Doing so may result in lost funds. All Makers are required
to pay for the onboarding fees for their customers.
