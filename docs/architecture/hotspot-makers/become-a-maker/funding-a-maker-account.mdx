Hotspot Makers must fund Maker wallets with enough Data Credits ("DC") and SOL to cover the
onboarding fees for all Hotspots they supply to customers.

---

## Funding a Maker Account

Funding a Maker wallet with Data Credits from HNT tokens is now performed in the Helium Wallet App.
The transaction costs for onboarding and location assertion are paid in SOL to the Solana
blockchain.

A current public view on the funding status of Maker wallets is available at:

See "Data Credits By Hotspot ManufacturerH. Helium Maker DC Balances"

### SOL Fees

These tokens are paid to the Solana blockchain.

|                                                        | IOT Hotspot Transaction Fee | MOBILE Hotspot Transaction Fee |

| MOBILE Hotspot onboarding <sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup> |                             | 0.00168736 SOL                 |
| **Total**                                              | **0.00365312 SOL**          | **0.00534048 SOL**             |

[^1]:
    Onboarding a MOBILE Hotspot is an additional SOL fee as all current MOBILE Hotspots are also IOT
    Hotspots. A MOBILE-only Hotspot would not be required to pay the IOT transaction fee. The Maker
    App can be configured to do both, either or just one of these network onboards.

### Data Credit Fees

These tokens are "burned".

[^2]: Currently 500,000 due to [HIP-69][hip-69] and [HIP-81][hip-81].

## Funding Maker Wallets with SOL

Funding a Maker wallet with SOL is performed the same way as sending tokens to any crypto wallet.
Send from an exchange, another wallet, or swap from another cryptocurrency within the [Helium
Wallet][helium-wallet] using the inbuilt browser and a swap aggregator such as [Jupiter][jupiter].

---

## Funding Maker Wallets with Data Credits

Funding a wallet with Data Credits requires HNT, as Data Credits can only be obtained using HNT. The
exchange rate for DC is $1 worth of HNT = 100,000 DC.

- If HNT is $2 then 0.5 HNT = 100,000 DC
- If HNT is $10 then 0.1 HNT = 100,000 DC

The USD/HNT exchange rate within the Helium Wallet App is used for the conversion and appears in the
Helium Wallet app before committing the transaction.

:::warning HNT to DC swaps are irreversible

Data Credits cannot be refunded, exchanged for other tokens, or transferred between wallets.

Always double-check the addresses before performing essential operations.

:::

### Swap HNT to DC within a Maker Wallet:

1. Select the Maker Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned for DC within the same Wallet.

The new DC balance amount can be verified in the app tokens list on the `$` tab within the Helium
Wallet app.

---

## Swap to Fund a Different Wallet

The Helium Wallet app can be used to swap HNT from one wallet to DC in a Maker wallet.

This method requires that the sending Wallet is already funded with HNT to swap and SOL for
transaction fees.

Firstly add the Maker Wallet address to the Address Book as a contact. This is the destination
wallet that you will send the DC to:

1. Tap the `Address Book` icon in the top right corner of the Helium Wallet app.
1. Add new contact with the Maker's Solana wallet address.

### Swap HNT to DC to send to a Maker Wallet:

1. Select any Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. **Tap the grey `Add Recipient +` text to enter the receiving Solana wallet address. This is the
   wallet address to send the DC to.**
1. Tap the `...` to the right of Solana Address and select the contact for the Maker Wallet.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned from the current wallet to DC in the recipient Maker Wallet.

The new DC balance amount in the recipient Maker Wallet can be verified by looking at the Helium
Data Credit token balance of the maker wallet on https://explorer.solana.com/
