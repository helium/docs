The Helium Hotspot provides a WiFi configuration interface via the
device's[ BLE services](/hotspot-makers/become-a-maker/hotspot-ble-services). The following are
instructions for how to configure a Hotspot's WiFi.

### Connecting to the Hotspot over Bluetooth Low Energy

1. Press the black button on the side of the Hotspot once, and wait a few seconds for the BLE
   advertising to begin. You will see the LED on top of the Hotspot turn blue when it is available.
2. Scan for connectable devices.
3. Connect to the Hotspot of interest with the following name format and UUID in its advertising
   payload.

   `Name: Helium Hotspot ####`

   `UUID: 0fda92b2-44a2-4af2-84f5-fa682baa2b8d`

4. Discover Services.

### Check if Hotspot is already Connected to WiFi

1. Read Value from:

   Service

   `UUID: 0fda92b2-44a2-4af2-84f5-fa682baa2b8d`

   Characteristic - WiFiSSID

   `UUID: 7731de63-bc6a-4100-8ab1-89b2356b038b`

2. If string value is empty, then no WiFi connection exist, if it is not empty, then it is currently
   connected to that WiFi SSID.
3. If it is not connected or you would like to change networks then proceed.

### Enable Notifications for WiFiSSID Characteristic Value Update\*\*

1. Enable Notifications for:

   Service

   `UUID: 0fda92b2-44a2-4af2-84f5-fa682baa2b8d`

   Characteristic - WiFiSSID

   `UUID: 7731de63-bc6a-4100-8ab1-89b2356b038b`

### Scan For WiFi Networks

1. Read Value from:

   Service

   `UUID: 0fda92b2-44a2-4af2-84f5-fa682baa2b8d`

   Characteristic -WiFiServices

   `UUID: d7515033-7e7b-45be-803f-c8737b171a29`

2. De-serialize the binary value into the WiFi Services
   [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) message found in
   [BLE Services Docs](/hotspot-makers/become-a-maker/hotspot-ble-services#wifiservices---characteristic).
   This will give you a list of available WiFi SSID string names.

### Set Credentials For WiFi Network

1. Using the SSID string from the scan, and password string provided by you, do the following to set
   the credentials.

   1. Serialize your WiFi Connect [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
      message, the definition of which is found in the
      [BLE Services Sheet](/hotspot-makers/become-a-maker/hotspot-ble-services#wificonnect---characteristic).
   2. Write serialized Value to

      Service

      `UUID: 0fda92b2-44a2-4af2-84f5-fa682baa2b8d`

      Characteristic - WiFiConnect

      `UUID: 398168aa-0111-4ec0-b1fa-171671270608`

### Wait For WiFiSSID Notification to Trigger

When the notification triggers, this indicates WiFi connection success. You can repeat step two in
order to verify the correct WiFi SSID name.
