On Solana, the issuance of Hotspots requires that an approved maker be created on-chain. This
happens in 3 steps:

- Creation of a maker in the onboarding server.
- Approval of the `MakerV0` on-chain.
- Creation of the `MakerV0` on-chain.

First, you will need a working Solana wallet with the Solana CLI. Follow this guide
https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/wallets/file-system.

You will need to fund this wallet with Sol to create the maker.

## Getting a Maker in the Onboarding Server

Contact the Helium Foundation to have an API key and maker public key created on the onboarding
server. For the rest of this guide, the maker public key will be referred to as the Issuing
Authority. This is the Solana public key that has the authority to create Hotspots for this maker.

## Installing the Helium Admin CLI

The `helium-admin-cli` is a very minimal command line interface for performing administrative
operations on the Solana blockchain. Its target is mainly developers and contains minimal help or
documentation. For this guide, you will only need to run one specific command which will be
documented here.

If you do not already have nodejs installed on your system, you will need to install it.

Then,

```
npm install -g @helium/helium-admin-cli
```

You will be using the `create-maker` command with the following args:

```
  -k, --wallet            Anchor wallet keypair
                           [default: "/Users/noahprince/.config/solana/id.json"]
  -u, --url               The solana url      [default: "http://127.0.0.1:8899"]
  -n, --name              The name of the maker              [string] [required]
      --issuingAuthority  Key that can issue hotspots on behalf of this maker
                                                             [string] [required]
      --updateAuthority   Key that can update the maker's issuing authority
                                                             [string] [required]
      --metadataUrl       URL to metadata for this maker. Should be JSON with at
                          least { name, image, description } [string] [required]
  -c, --makerCount        Estimated number of hotspots this maker will have
                                                             [number] [required]
```

Onboarding yourself as a maker will require paying for a merkle tree to store the Hotspot NFTs
created under your maker account. You should use the flag `-c` to estimate the count of Hotspots you
plan to eventually onboard. If this limit is reached, your maker wallet will be charged an equal
amount of sol to create another tree.

The `--metadataUrl` flag should be used to set the collection metadata for your maker. Every Hotspot
issued is an NFT, and it will belong to an NFT collection defined by the JSON at this URL. Ideally,
it should have the following fields:

- `name` - The name of the maker
- `description` - A short description of the maker
- `image` - A recognizable image for the maker, likely a logo.

To create the maker:

```
helium-admin create-maker -u <your-rpc-url> \
                          -k path/to/your/solana/wallet.json \
                          -n <your maker name> \
                          --issuingAuthority <your issuing authority> \
                          --updateAuthority <the pubkey you will use as an admin for this maker> \
                          -c <your estimated hotspot count> \
                          --metadataUrl <your-metadata-url>
```

You should see some output like:

```

### MOBILE Maker

Mobile makers are required to stake 50m MOBILE. To do this, transfer 50m MOBILE tokens to the maker
address listed above when creating the maker (the text after `Creating maker with address:`).

## Maker Approval

Once your maker has been created on-chain, and all other maker requirements have been fulfilled, the
Helium Foundation multisig will need to approve the maker. Please contact the Helium Foundation and
provide the exact name you used with the `-n` flag.
