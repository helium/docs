## Introduction

Helium hotspots (miners) operate in the EU868, also known as the EU863-870 MHz unlicensed band, as
modified LoRaWAN compatible gateways. Currently the Helium system operates on 200 kHz channel
frequencies from 868.1 to 868.8 MHz in the EU868 band.

The CE Radio Equipment Directive, also known as CE RED, covers regulatory certification for all EU
member states. Other regulatory country bodies, such as Australia, some Middle Eastern, and African
countries also accept CE RED certification testing. CE RED is the most commonly accepted testing in
many countries around the world.

Using CE pre-certified LoRaWAN gateway concentrator modules based on Semtech Corcell card designs
from marketplace suppliers can assist in the development of a new gateway product but these may or
may not include all the required certifications for Helium system support. As discussed in several
sections of this application note, not all EU member states are harmonised with their technical
specifications. It is the ultimate responsibility of manufacturers providing Helium compatible
network products that proper regulatory testing and certification or recertification is obtained for
countries of intended operation.

In this application note the term gateway and hotspot are used interchangeably.

## CE RED Certification Requirements

Helium gateways currently operate on 9 frequencies in the 867 to 869 MHz range and are regulated by
ETSI standards. An additional channel at 869.525 MHz is supported by the gateway as a downlink
receive slot 2 (RX2) frequency. The Helium gateways meet current LoRaWAN specifications TS001-1.0.4
and RP002-1.0.3, the document links are given in the references section above. To meet ETSI
requirements transmissions are duty cycle limited and do not use listen-before-talk protocol which
require different testing.

The Helium frequency chart for EU868 operation is shown below. Note that uplink (transmissions to
the gateway) and downlink (transmissions from the gateway) frequencies are the same with no offsets.
These are the minimum frequencies required for operation on the Helium network. Developers may want
to test and certify for a wider EU868 frequency range of 863 through 870 MHz, 35 channels with
separations of 200 kHz, for possible future frequency expansions or the use of alternate frequencies
in some regions. It is important to note that additional frequency ranges, such as band K (863 – 865
MHz), have lower transmit duty cycle requirements.

## ETSI Testing Requirements

ETSI standards define acceptable test procedures and limits. There are two applicable ETSI
specifications, EN 300-220-1 V3.1.1 (Part 1) and EN 300-200-2 V3.1.1 (Part 2). Note that the ETSI
specification EN 300-220-1 was split into these two parts with the latest versions V3.1.1 in 2017.
The Part 2 specification provides a “Harmonised Standard” for short range devices in the 25 to 1000
MHz frequency range while the Part 1 specification gives details for “Technical characteristics and
methods of measurement”. Overall, Part 2 lists frequency bands and RF regulations for these bands
and points the reader to the applicable sections in Part 1 for specifics of measurement methods. The
EU868 (863 – 870 MHz) frequency range is broken up into many sub-bands with different power and duty
cycle requirements which are defined in the Part 2 specification.

Since these specifications are linked, the required test explanations below for LoRaWAN / Helium
gateway certification will have the applicable sections of EN 300-220-2 and EN 300-220-1 listed.

ETSI EN 300-220-1 4.3.3 defines normal test conditions and the following section 4.3.4 defines
extreme test conditions. Extreme conditions require additional testing over temperature and source
voltage variations depending on the operational profile defined by the manufacturer. Some standards
only require testing at normal conditions while others also require testing at extreme testing
conditions.

### EN 300-220-2 4.2.1 / EN 300-220-1 5.1.1 Operating Frequency

The manufacturer will declare the operating band or bands, frequencies, and operating channel widths
in the certification filing. See EN 300-220-2, Annex B and C, for tables of allowable frequencies
and bands of operation. Annex B lists the frequencies for EU wide national harmonised radio and
Annex C for radio interfaces not EU wide harmonised. The Annex C (not harmonised) is for operational
frequencies that may be allowed in some EU countries, but not all. It is up to the manufacturer to
determine which EU countries that the gateway may operate in and the requirements of that country.
Additional insight on this subject is given in the Semtech TN1300.01 technical note with a link in
the References.

### EN 300-220-2 4.2.2 / EN 300-220-1 5.9 Spurious Emissions

Unintended spurious emissions are measured in both transmit and receive / standby modes with
different limits for each operational mode. EN 300-220-1 5.9.1 defines a spectral mask when
transmitting with varying spurious limits depending on the frequency spacing from the intended
channel. Spurious emissions are measured in both conducted and radiated modes with the exception of
devices without antenna connectors (permanent antenna) are permitted to have radiated only
measurements. The ETSI specification covers a wide range of frequencies depending on the test mode
from 9 kHz to 6 GHz. The equipment under test must be measured at the lowest and highest operating
frequencies at maximum power. Normal test conditions are only required for spurious emissions
measurements.

### EN 300-220-2 4.3.1 / EN 300-220-1 5.2 Effective Radiated Power

Effective radiated power is measured by direct connection to the EUT when an external antenna port
is available. The power may be measured by radiated means when there is no external antenna
connector available. The maximum gain of the antenna, referenced to an ideal dipole, to be used with
the equipment is included in the test report. For conducted results of effective radiated power the
gain of the antenna must be added to the measured conducted power. This test is measured in transmit
mode at the lowest and highest frequencies of operation and also under normal and extreme test
conditions.

### EN 300-220-2 4.3.2 / EN 300-220-1 5.3 Maximum e.r.p. Spectral Density

Effective radiated power spectral density is defined as the maximum power radiated when transmitting
in units of power per hertz over the power envelop. Antenna gain referenced to a dipole, as in the
effective radiated power test, must be included in the calculation. It is important to note that the
e.r.p. spectral density test may be the limiting factor for the power setting of the gateway.

Since gateways operate operate on several ETSI defined band “L” frequencies, specific limits may
apply depending on the EU country where it is intended for operation. In EN 300-220-2 Annex C,
certain “not EU harmonised” countries may not require the EUT to meet this regulation for spectral
density and allow 25 mW effective radiated power. For LoRaWAN / Helium operation in regions that
require this test the power will be limited to approximately 5 mW. The applicant should contact the
regulatory agencies of each EU country for the current rules and work with a testing service
facility to determine the proper limits.

This test is measured in transmit mode at the lowest and highest frequencies of operation under
normal test conditions only.

### EN 300-220-2 4.3.3 / EN 300-220-1 5.4 Transmit Duty Cycle

The intent of the maximum transmitter duty cycle test is to not exceed the duty cycle limits given
in ETSI 300-220-2 Annex B and C. The EUT should be in “normal use” mode and the duty cycle
observational period is 1 hour of normal operation.

### EN 300-220-2 4.3.4 / EN 300-220-1 5.6 Transmit Occupied Bandwidth

Transmit occupied bandwidth is defined as the frequency range in which 99% of the total power of an
emission falls. This parameter is tested at the lowest and highest frequencies of operation and
under normal and extreme test conditions.

### EN 300-220-2 4.3.5 / EN 300-220-1 5.8 Transmit Out of Band Emissions

Two out of band emissions requirements are defined in ETSI specifications: The operating channel and
operational frequency band. The operating channel mask defines the emissions near the channel of
operation while the frequency band emissions include everything out to the operating band limits.
These spectrum masks may overlap. ETSI 300-220-1 5.8.1 defines the masks for both specifications.
Out of band emissions are tested at the lowest and highest frequencies of operation and also under
normal and extreme test conditions.

### EN 300-220-2 4.3.6 / EN 300-220-1 5.10 Transmit Transient Power

Transmit transient power is defined as the transmit power falling outside the current operating
channel when the transmitter is switched on and off. Transient power is measured at the lowest and
highest frequencies of operation at normal operating conditions only.

### EN 300-220-2 4.4.2 / EN 300-220-1 5.18 Receiver Blocking

Receiver blocking is defined as the capability of the receiver to receive a wanted modulated signal
without exceeding a given degradation due to the presence of a stronger unwanted input signal other
than a spurious response or an adjacent channel. The test is performed with 2 signal generators, one
on-channel with the wanted modulated signal and an offset generator with an unmodulated carrier. EN
300-220-2 specifies the minimum performance standard is a category 2, and EN300-220-2 5.18.3 defines
the levels for category 2. Blocking is measured at normal test conditions only but ETSI requires at
least 1 measurement per band that the EUT operates in.

### Conducted and Radiated Tests, Antenna Requirements

The effective radiated output power, EN 300-220-1 5.2, as discussed above takes into account antenna
gain. The maximum antenna gain, with respect to a dipole reference, must be added to output power to
determine the effective radiated output power. Gateways with antennas that have gain over a standard
dipole will need to reduce their maximum conducted power settings to meet this specification.

ETSI certification testing is mostly written around conducted methods where a cable is attached to
the antenna port or a test port. The specifications do allow for radiated testing of most parameters
which may be the case for EUTs that do not have readily available test connections. See EN 300-220-1
sections 4.3.7, 4.3.8, and 4.3.9 for requirements. Spurious emissions is a notable exception to
conducted only test procedures where a radiated measurement must be taken.

While radiated testing for most parameters is allowed, it is usually not practical to attempt
extreme test conditions with this test method especially over temperature extremes. Most gateway
designs are stationary devices and are assumed to have access to an antenna connector or an internal
test connector.

## Helium Foundation Expected Minimum Performance

While all Helium gateways for operation in the EU must meet CD RED standards as presented in the
sections above, additional performance parameters not regulated by ETSI standards are expected to
ensure the intended operation of the Helium network. Maximum output power for the operational modes
is regulated by ETSI regulations, however, ETSI does not specify minimum power output. Likewise, the
EU does not regulate receiver minimum sensitivity levels for duty cycle limited devices.

For the proper operation of the Helium network, minimum power outputs and receiver sensitivity are
expected for Helium’s hotspot approval process (see HIP19). The minimum performance levels are based
on Semtech Corecell reference design using the SX1302 baseband processor and SX1250 RF transceiver.
The Semtech performance report (link in the references) shows typical power outputs in section 4 and
receiver performance for various spreading factors in section 8. Helium expects power output to be
within 1 dB of the Corcell reference design and receiver sensitivities to be no worse than 2 dB
above the reference design levels.
