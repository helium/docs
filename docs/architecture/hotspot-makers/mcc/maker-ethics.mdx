The community may raise ethics violation issues and send evidence to the Helium Foundation

# Summary

This ethics document is written by the Manufacturing Compliance Committee (MCC) to clearly document
what the ethics expectations of manufacturers are. If a manufacturer fails to uphold the ethics and
expectations outlined in this document, the Helium community reserves the right to take action
against the manufacturer. The consequence will be decided on by the Helium community and may
include: requests for more information, selling restrictions, temporary probation, or in extreme
cases, revoking of a maker's key or a ban from the community.

In order to achieve the collective goal of a global decentralized Helium network, large volumes of
Hotspots are manufactured by a wide range of manufacturers. The existing HIP-19 application process
and guidelines provide new and existing Helium Hotspot manufacturers specific guidance on the
hardware design, configuration, security, and manufacturing requirements needed to become an
approved Helium compatible Hotspot manufacturer.

Only HIP-19 approved manufacturers are granted the trusted privilege to add new Hotspots to the
Helium network. With this privilege, manufacturers are also entrusted with the responsibility to act
ethically and with the proper internal processes to protect the integrity of the Helium network.

## Ethics Tenents

### 1. Reporting Gaming

Manufacturers bear the responsibility to proactively report any potential “gamed” deployment by
their customers, partners, insiders, or employees.

- Gaming is defined as any product, process, or service that mines or earns HNT token rewards from
  the Helium blockchain without providing unimpeded Helium network coverage and/or data packet
  routing and throughput. For example, methods to spoof RSSI levels or attenuate RF signal
  propagation with the objective of faking network coverage are considered gaming.
  - Manufacturers will be held accountable for gaming infractions associated with the company’s
    employees, partners, or insiders.
  - Manufacturers shall not modify device firmware in any way to enable or facilitate “gaming”.
  - Manufacturers shall not provide services or access to proprietary technical reference material
    that facilitates gaming by their customers, partners, insiders, or employees.

### 2. Maintain Internal Controls of Swarm Keys

Manufacturers must have and maintain internal controls and processes to ensure the integrity of the
generation and registration of the miner swarm keys consistent with their HIP-19 approved
applications for the full life cycle of their products.

- These internal controls and processes may be subject to additional auditing if manufacturer
  activity warrants it.

### 3. Publish Order Fulfillment Process

Manufacturers must clearly publish **on their website** their order fulfillment process, including
the priority in which orders will be fulfilled, for both direct orders and by their authorized
distributor channels.

- Manufacturers must disclose **on their website** the monthly number of units being allocated to
  employees, company insiders, and/or partners for their first 12 months of initial production.

### 4. Publish Monthly Shipping Updates

Manufacturers must publish **on their website** monthly shipment updates for all back-ordered
products.

- The full terms and conditions of product sales, including the manufacturer's refund policy, must
  be clearly published on the company and/or authorized distributor websites.
  - Refund policy must explicitly state:
    - A customer's right to receive a refund.
    - How any presales funds are being used. (Only permitted after MOC approval)
    - How a customer will receive their refund.
    - Length of time it will take to receive.

### 5. Communicate Product Support Plan

Manufacturers must clearly communicate their complete product support plan **on their website**
including:

- Mobile application(s) required for Hotspot on-boarding
- How they plan to support their Onboarding server
- The expected lifetime of free OTA updates for products
  - Disclose any “premium” or fee-based features, including extending the product lifetime of OTA
    updates.

### 6. Keep Product Information Up To Data

Manufacturers must keep their Helium-compatible product information up to date on their website\*\*
including:

- Product information including:
  - Model name
  - Countries serviced
- User installation guides
- Links to Helium Network reference sites
  - [https://status.helium.com/](https://status.helium.com/)
  - [https://engineering.helium.com/](https://engineering.helium.com/)
  - [https://discord.com/invite/helium](https://discord.com/invite/helium)

### 7. Communicate and Perform Firmware and Network Updates

The Helium blockchain and Helium Network are rapidly evolving and require frequent firmware and
network updates.

- Manufacturers must proactively communicate **on their website** the status of their products
  relative to the Helium blockchain and network including:
  - OTA status
  - The current firmware revision number

### 8. Maintain Firmware

Firmware updates must be promptly maintained by manufacturers.

- We expect that manufacturers have an automated process by which their firmware is updated.

### 9. Communicate HNT Acquisition Plan for Onboarding

Manufacturers must clearly communicate **to the MCC on their HIP-19 proposal** how they intend to
obtain the HNT needed to fund onboarding. Approved Hotspot Makers are responsible for supplying Data
Credits (DCs) to the onboarding server for Hotspots they sell.

### 10. Maintain Integrity of the Helium Network

Manufacturers are responsible for the integrity of the network and should take care to sell only to
genuine resellers and partners. Manufacturers will be held accountable for the integrity of their
distributor/ reseller network.

### 11. The MCC considers Dual-Mining to be a gateway/Hotspot that mines both Helium tokens and another application.

1. Dual-mining is only permitted so long as it does not conflict with a DeWi Network.
   1. A DeWi network is any decentralized wireless network running on a blockchain and issuing
      tokens. Examples include LoRaWAN, CBRS, WiFi, etc.
2. Dual-Mining on a Hotspot, on another DeWi network in a way that is competitive with the growth of
   Helium Networks is not allowed.
