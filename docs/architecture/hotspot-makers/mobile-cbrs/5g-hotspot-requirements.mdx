:::info

This document is the Hardware Audit procedure for 5G/CBRS Hotspots which have a FreedomFi
whitelabel.

:::

## Certification Process

Certification will require two steps, both performed by the
[Manufacturing Compliance Committee](/hotspot-makers/compliance-committee) ("MCC").

1. Functional Certification.
2. System Certification.

### Audit Process

- Indoor and Outdoor Hotspots arriving together will be audited together.
- Indoor and Outdoor Hotspots arriving more than 2 weeks apart will be audited separately.
- Re-audit (such as change in model) required only if any of the following:
  - CPU changes.
  - RAM decreases.
  - Storage decreases.
  - Change in radio.
  - Change in security element.
  - Change in any parameter that requires regulatory recertification.

---

## Functional Certification

### Section 1: Hardware Unboxing and Review

- Provide directions for how to change Orc8r to FreedomFi's Orc8r or give Foundation ssh access.
- Record date of audit.
- Record Model name and serial number.
- Link to vendor provided documentation.
- Link to HIP-19 proposal on Github.
- Link to Vendor website.
- List expected certifications (for CBRS, only FCC is relevant).
- Check antenna connector, must be reverse SMA.
- Unbox hardware and list what has been received (number received, Indoor/Outdoor).
- Record block diagram of system including the secure boot hardware:
  - The diagrams should include all the hardware involved in the boot process and the security
    boundaries of each component.
  - Hardware items to illustrate include (but are not limited to):
    - Cryptographic hardware accelerator
    - Secure storage for private/secret and public keys
    - Secure RAM
    - Boot ROM
    - Untrusted external RAM
    - Untrusted external non-volatile storage (eMMC, SATA, etc)
    - Communication busses
  - The diagram must also show the security boundaries of your design. Group each component and bus
    by the boundary it resides in.
  - Image of PCB with secure security element clearly outlined

### Section 2: Hardware Specifications

- Does the hardware meet the specifications.
- Is the hardware the same in the HIP-19 application and on the manufacturer's website as what was
  sent for the audit?
- Auditor may run one or more of the following to check hardware:
  - Inspect CPU: `cat /proc/cpuinfo`
  - Check memory: `free --mega`
  - Check storage: `lsblk`

### Section 3: Verify Secure Element Configuration

Purpose of this section is to verify that the key is secure

- Check firmware version is up to date: `sudo docker exec helium_miner_1 miner versions`
  - _NOTE: In FreedomFi’s firmware, it is necessary to keep the miner image running when attempting
    to run`gateway_mfr`. This is because the miner image has a helper daemon that `gateway_mfr`
    needs to contact in order to “talk” to the TPM._
- Query the Miner for its working keys/ verify that private and public are the same:
  `sudo docker exec helium_miner_1 miner print_keys`
- Download the Miner from Helium's repo
- Query the TPM for its keys:
  `docker exec helium_miner_1 /gateway_mfr --device "tpm://tpm/HS/SRK/MinerKey" test` to verify keys
  match.

### Section 4: RF Verification

- Verify Manufacturue has RF Verification.
- Check US915 configuration file.

---

## System Certification

### Section 5: UE Connection To Network

:::info Telecom Acronym

User Equipment ("UE") refers to any device capable of connecting to the Internet, such as a phone,
tablet or computer.

:::

- Connect a UE Device to the CBRS network and perform activity such as downloading photos, sending
  emails, and chat using Discord while using the 5G network.
  - **Does the UE connect to the network and able to use it?**
- Verify that the UE is connected to the correct network by matching the IMSI and IP address:
  `mobility_cli.py get_subscriber_table`
  - **Is the UE connected to the expected network?**
- Verify that the UE is connected to the correct radio by matching the EARFCN and
  CI:`sudo cat /var/opt/magma/configs/gateway.mconfig`
  - Check the "enodebd" section for "cellId" and "earfcndl" numbers and compare them to the numbers
    in Carrier Lab Dashboard (app for iOS) and/or About Phone in Android.
  - **Is the UE connected to the expected radio and do the EARFCN and CI match?**
- Verify attach-detach with service request for single UE, can a single UE attach and detach from
  the network?
  - Using wireshark:
    `ssh support@IP_ADDDRESS sudo tcpdump -i enodebr0 -U -s0 -w - 'not tcp port 22' | /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/Wireshark -k -i -`
    filter on sctp and put the UE in airplane mode, toggle and look for detach request
  - **Is the UE able to leave and rejoin the network**

### Section 6: Federation Gateway (FeG) and Magma connection

- Verify that traffic is flowing through Magma rather than locally by sniffing traffic between radio
  and AGW where GTP traffic is encapsulated.
  - **Are source and destination IP showing 2-way traffic?** **Is there GTP traffic present?**
- Verify that traffic is flowing through the Foundation hosted Federation Gateway by looking at
  messages that show that the UE's SIM card is getting checked by the Foundation's HSS.
  - **Is the public IP of the Foundation hosted FeG present?** **Is the UE SIM card pointing at the
    Foundation HSS?**

### Section 7: UDP/ TCP traffic

- Verify attach to network with uplink `UDP` data and then detach from network to show traffic
  flowing inside of the GTP tunnel.
  - Traffic flows from the UE to Google's DNS using `UDP`.
  - Use **Wireshark** while browsing internet and filter on `udp.dstport == 53`.
  - **Is traffic present in the GTP tunnel in 8.8.8.8.?**
- Verify attach to network with uplink `TCP` data and then detach from network to show traffic
  flowing inside of the GTP tunnel.
  - Traffic flows from the UE to Google's DNS using `TCP`.
  - Use **Wireshark** while browsing internet and filter on `TCP`.
  - **Is traffic present in the GTP tunnel?**

### Section 8: UE Failure

- Verify attach/ detach for two UEs
  - Put 2 UEs into airplane mode and reconnect to internet in and out of airplane mode.
  - Use **Wireshark** and filter on `sctp`.
  - **Is attach/ detach messaging present?**
- Verify radio link failure for single or many UEs.
  - Toggle airplane mode on UE, then leave it attached to the network (not in airplane mode) and
    place it in a Faraday cage.
  - This may be verified by using **Wireshark** and look for GUTI cleared/ IMEI cleared.
  - This may also be verified by looking at the subscriber data with the timestamp before and after
    `mobility_cli.py get_subscriber_table;date`
  - **Does UE detach from network in simulated failure mode?**
