## Network of Networks

A general structure for onboarding new Decentralized Network Protocols (DNPs) to the broader Helium
Network was created with the passing of
[HIP-51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md). The Helium Mobile
DAO with 5G Hotspots is the first step in the evolution of the Helium ecosystem.

The passing of [HIP-51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md)
additionally allows for the creation of MOBILE tokens that will reward 5G Hotspots with Small Cell
Radio(s) on the existing Helium Blockchain.
