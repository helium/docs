The migration of the Helium L1 to the Solana L1 brings several changes to the setup of the Network
and its associated subnetworks infrastructure. Chief among these changes is moving a lot of data
that has previously been "on-chain" (namely PoC data) "off-chain".

As such, this migration introduces several Oracles which serve as bridges between the external world
and the blockchain. These infrastructure changes allow the Helium Network to effectively introduce
new Networks as Decentralized Network Protocol (DNP) subnetworks, and more easily scale existing DNP
subnetworks (e.g., IOT) by removing existing bottlenecks.

With the deprecation of the Helium L1, changes to the API and
[ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) include:

1. Existing ETL codebase will no longer sync blocks.
2. Existing API codebase will no longer serve new data, the API codebase will remain accessible on
   GitHub at [https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http)
3. api.helium.io (built on top of legacy ETL and API) is no longer available.
4. The legacy Explorer hosted at explorer-old.helium.com is no longer available, the Explorer
   codebase will remain accessible on GitHub at
   [https://github.com/helium/explorer](https://github.com/helium/explorer).

<summary>Accessing Historical Blockchain Data</summary>

The Legacy Blockchain API was retired on July 28, 2023.

For details on alternate sources of the legacy Helium L1 data, please see the
[Blockchain API Solana Migration Guide](/solana/migration/blockchain-api).

**New API access options include:**

1. New datasets are available and will continue to be available on
   [AWS S3, via compressed Protobuf files](/oracles/oracle-data).
2. Sample API code has been published in the
   [Oracles S3 Observer Sample App](https://github.com/dewi-alliance/oracle-observer-sample). It
   uses AWS Lambda to ingest the S3 files to a PostgreSQL database and serve them as JSON via an
   API.
3. Third parties are working on new APIs and services to replace existing tools (e.g.,
   [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/api/),
   [HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com/b/helium-offchain-api.html),
   [Relay](https://www.relaydevice.com), etc.).
