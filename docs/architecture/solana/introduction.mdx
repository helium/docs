## Major Milestones

- Available on Solana devnet for testing [Complete]
- sec3 Smart Contract Audit
  [[Complete](https://github.com/sec3-service/reports/blob/master/reports/sec3_helium_program_library_report.pdf)]
- Mainnet Launch [Complete]

### Migration Process Steps

The migration to Solana took place on April 18, 2023, beginning at 9am PST. The team held a 48-hour
window to complete the migration. Hotspots and LoRaWAN devices continued to operate throughout the
migration window.

1. The Helium blockchain officially halted.
2. A snapshot was taken of Helium chain state.
3. Existing $HNT and $MOBILE were mapped to Solana. Hotspots were minted as NFTs.
4. During the Migration, PoC and Data Transfer continued to function through the off-chain Oracle,
   rewards were claimable after the transition phase (estimated 24-48 hours) was complete.
5. Users and Exchanges can access their assets using the same private key on Solana (Solana and
   Helium blockchain use the same [ed25519 encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA)
   algorithm.)
6. Programmatic Treasury was activated in 2023 Q2, users will be able to convert $MOBILE and $IOT
   into $HNT on chain at that time.

## Migration Guides

As part of the Helium blockchain migration to Solana, there are some changes to existing Helium
Wallets and Applications for users to be aware of.

Complete [migration guides](/solana/migration/) have been written for different users of Helium.

:::info Hotspot NFTs and Token Management

The Helium Network move to the Solana blockchain will result in all Hotspots automatically becoming
[Solana NFTs](https://solana.com/developers/nfts) which, along with the Helium Network Tokens (HNT,
IOT, and MOBILE), can be viewed in the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

## Helium Programs on Solana

The code for all of these Programs is open source, and available in the
[helium-program-library](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library) repository on Github.

:::info Program Audits

The Helium Programs have been audited by [sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/). The audit report was
published March 20, 2023. The audit report is available from sec3 on their
[GitHub reports repo](https://github.com/sec3-service/reports/blob/master/reports/sec3_helium_program_library_report.pdf).

:::

#### circuit_breaker

- Program ID: `circAbx64bbsscPbQzZAUvuXpHqrCe6fLMzc2uKXz9g`
- Generic program wrapping sensitive mint authorities and token accounts in the Helium system to
  prevent large movements in the case of an exploit or bug.

#### data_credits

- Program ID: `credMBJhYFzfn7NxBMdU4aUqFggAjgztaCcv2Fo6fPT`
- Manages the purchase, delegation, and burning of data credits.

#### helium_entity_manager

- Program ID: `hemjuPXBpNvggtaUnN1MwT3wrdhttKEfosTcc2P9Pg8`
- Handles the issuance of NFTs representing entities that are rewardable on the Helium network, such
  as Hotspots and mappers.

#### helium_sub_daos

- Program ID: `hdaoVTCqhfHHo75XdAMxBKdUqvq1i5bF23sisBqVgGR`
- Manages the DAO/subnetwork structure proposed in HIP-51, including the minting of tokens to
  subnetworks, HST holders, and the `lazy_distributor` for PoC earnings.

#### lazy_distributor

- Program ID: `1azyuavdMyvsivtNxPoz6SucD18eDHeXzFCUPq5XU7w`
- Allows off-chain Oracles to distribute PoC rewards to rewardable assets (such as Hotspots) that
  are represented as NFTs.

#### lazy_transactions

- Program ID: `1atrmQs3eq1N2FEYWu6tyTXbCjP4uQwExpjtnhXtS8h`
- Used in the initial migration to Solana, this program allows compressing many transactions into a
  merkle root to be executed lazily. This guarantees all transactions are executed exactly once.

#### treasury_management

- Program ID: `treaf4wWBBty3fHdyBpo35Mz84M8k3heKXmjmi9vFt5`
- Manages the treasury of each subnetwork as proposed in HIP-51, allowing DNT tokens to be swapped
  for HNT according to a formula.

#### voter_stake_registry

- Program ID: `hvsrNC3NKbcryqDs2DocYHZ9yPKEVzdSjQG6RVtK1s8`
- Handles voting power via veHNT in Helium Governance.
