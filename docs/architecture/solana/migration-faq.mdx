# FAQ - Solana Migration

## Why Does My Account Have A Small Amount Of SOL?

Every migrated Wallet was seeded with a small amount, approximately 0.00139 SOL for
transactions, enough for roughly 100 transactions. The amount of SOL needs to be topped up and it is
recommended topping up with 0.1 and keeping it above 0.02 SOL. If the balance is between 0.01 and 
0.001 SOL then transactions attempted on the blockchain may fail due to lack of funds.

## Where Can I See My Hotspot's Activity And Rewards?

Oracle Data is available to application developers such as [Helium Geek](https://heliumgeek.com/), 
[Moken](https://explorer.moken.io/), [Relay](https://app.relaywireless.com/explorer) and [Hotspotty](https://app.hotspotty.net/), who have built interfaces to monitor Hotspot
activity and rewards.

## What Is The IOT Token?

Instead of earning HNT, LoRaWAN Hotspots will earn IOT rewards for their PoC and data transfer. 
IOT can be swapped for HNT in the Helium Wallet app or on an exchange. Find more info about the [IOT](/tokens/iot-token) Token.

## How Do I Stake My HNT Tokens?

Staking HNT tokens uses the Helium Foundation created [Modular Governance](https://heliumvote.com/iot) and can be done directly in the Helium
Wallet app, by selecting the Governance Icon and selecting "Your Voting Power"

More instructions are available at [Staking on Helium Vote](/governance/staking-with-helium-vote).

## How Can I Exchange Or See The Exchange Rate For My Tokens?

Here are 2 ways to do this:

1. On the home screen in the Helium Wallet App, there is an orange button for swapping tokens that
   leverages the Jupiter DEX.
2. Directly using a Decentralized EXchange (DEX) like [Jupiter](https://jup.ag) or [Orca](https://orca.so)

:::warning

Please always check the swap or exchange rate before you confirm a transaction. You are responsible for 
the confirmation of the exchange rate that is shown.

## Why are there so few rewards transactions?

Rewards are distributed after each epoch, at approximately 1:30 AM UTC daily.

Hotspots receive rewards for all the activity within an epoch as one sum.

Rewards must be claimed from Hotspots to wallets. And can be done individually per Hotspot or by claiming
from all hoptspots at once.

## Is It Possible To Migrate A Wallet Without Having To Log Into The Helium Wallet App?

Yes, Wallets can be migrated directly within the Helium docs with
the online [migration widget](/solana/migration/exchange#mapping-helium-wallets-to-solana-wallets) or by
following manual instructions.

Enter an old Helium address into the entry box and click the "Seed Wallet" button, give it a few
seconds, and the Wallet will be migrated over to Solana.

## Why Am I Getting The `{"Instructionerror":[0, {"Custom":1}]}` Error When I Try To Stake?

This error occurs when a Wallet does not have enough SOL to proceed with a transaction. For example,
a Wallet will need approximately 0.02 SOL to stake.

Use the [HNT-SOL Swapping widget](/tokens/sol-token) in the Helium docs to swap HNT for SOL as
needed.

## When Do I Get My First Rewards For Delegations?

Rewards for delegations are distributed in the epoch following the delegation.

For example, a delegation in epoch 10 will receive a rewards distribution at the end of epoch 11 and
every following epoch in which the delegation is unchanged.

## What Is The Difference Between the Decaying And Constant Locks?

You can find the explanation for the two in the Helium Docs:

- [Decaying (Previously known as Cliff)](/governance/staking-with-helium-vote#decaying)
- [Constant](/governance/staking-with-helium-vote#constant)

## How Can I Get The New Address To My Wallet?

Here are 3 ways you can get your new Helium address:

1. In the Helium Wallet App, Settings > Copy Address > Solana.
2. In the Helium Wallet App, on the tokens screen, click the copy symbol to the right of the address 
above the wallet value.
3. Using another service Foundation is providing, you can go to this URL, and it will return your
   new address.

   ```
   https://migration.web.helium.io/helium/<HNT-Wallet-Address>
   ```

## How do I see my Hotspots in the Wallet App?

Click on the Collectables Icon and they are shown under the Hotspots filter.

## Why Does My Helium Wallet App Crash When I Open It?

The Helium Wallet App must be updated to version `2.7.2` or later.

If your device's App/Play Store is not showing an update button, check manually by clicking on the
app inside the store to see more info, and the button should show "Update" instead of "Open".

If neither works, save your [seed phrase](/wallets/wallet-seed-phrase), and reinstall the app.
