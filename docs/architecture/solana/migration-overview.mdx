Following the community-driven proposal,
[HIP70 - Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md),
the Helium Network was successfully migrated to the Solana blockchain on **April 18, 2023, 9am PST**
(16:00 UTC). This strategic move, voted in by the community, let the Helium Network capitalize on
Solana's scalability, low transaction costs, and high-performance capabilities, including fast
transaction throughput and energy-efficient consensus mechanism.

The migration to Solana brought many benefits for the Helium Network: it enabled the IoT and Mobile
networks to support even greater scale, support more sophisticated Proof-of-Coverage algorithms, and
enhanced the network's robustness, making it an even more attractive solution for high-demand
applications.
