The Legacy Blockchain API was retired on July 28, 2023.

To accommodate the need for historical data, a CSV export of the Helium L1 data will be available on
a requestor-pays basis on AWS in the `foundation-helium-l1-archive-requester-pays` bucket.

For ongoing access, several organizations are already building new API services based on the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) available after the migration. These organizations include but
not limited to:

- [HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com/b/helium-offchain-api.html)
- [Relay](https://www.relaydevice.com)

<!-- TODO: add when an API is available - [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/api/) -->
