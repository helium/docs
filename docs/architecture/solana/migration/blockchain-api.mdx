The existing [Helium API](/blockchain/api) will serve only information up to the chain halt at the
time of migration. Knowing that some users will continue to rely on historical data, The Helium
Foundation has formed an agreement with the API provider, BlockJoy, to continue hosting this API
following the migration.

For ongoing access, several organizations are already building new API services based on the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) available after the migration. These organizations include (but
not limited to), [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/api/),
[HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com/b/helium-offchain-api.html),
[Relay](https://www.relaydevice.com) and [Watchium](https://watchium.disk91.com).
