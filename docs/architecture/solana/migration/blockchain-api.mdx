The legacy blockchain API was retired on July 28, 2023.

To accommodate the need for historical data, a CSV export of the Helium L1 data is available on a
requestor-pays basis on AWS in the `foundation-helium-l1-archive-requester-pays` S3 bucket.

For ongoing access, the [Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) and Solana blockchain represent Helium 
state after the migration.
