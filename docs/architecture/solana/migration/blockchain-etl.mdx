Upon the migration to Solana, the [Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) halted
along with the Helium L1 blockchain.

The Helium Foundation public ETL instance of Helium L1 data has been shut down. A full snapshot of
the Helium L1 has been retained and uploaded for public availability; see
[Blockchain API](/solana/migration/blockchain-api) page for access to these files. The
`#data-analysis` channel in the Helium Discord server can be a helpful resource when working with
these files.

For ongoing insight into the operation of the Helium Network post-migration, please refer to the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) documentation.
