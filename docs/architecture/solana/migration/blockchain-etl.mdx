[Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) will halt along with the blockchain
during the migration. Hosted instances of this service may choose to continue offering historical
data from the Helium L1 via these synced ETLs. A full snapshot of the Helium L1 will be retained and
uploaded for public availability post-migration.

For ongoing insight into the operation of the Helium Network post-migration, please refer to the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) documentation.
