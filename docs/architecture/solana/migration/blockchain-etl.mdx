[Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) will halt along with the blockchain
during the migration. Hosted instances of this service may choose to continue offering historical
data from the Helium L1 via these synced ETLs.

A full snapshot of the Helium L1 has been retained and uploaded for public availability; see
[Blockchain API](/solana/migration/blockchain-api) page for a torrent link.

The Helium Foundation also hosts a publicly queryable instance of Helium L1 data at
[DeWi ETL](https://etl.dewi.org/). Note this server is in maintenance mode, and availability and
query performance are not guaranteed. Google Auth login is required. The
[Account Details](https://etl.dewi.org/dashboard/131-account-details?days=30) or
[Hotspot Details](https://etl.dewi.org/dashboard/7-hotspot-details?days=30) dashboards are good
jumping-off points. Please consult the `#data-analysis` channel in the Helium Discord server if you
have questions.

For ongoing insight into the operation of the Helium Network post-migration, please refer to the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) documentation.
