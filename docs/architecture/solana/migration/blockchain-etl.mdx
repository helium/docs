Upon the migration to Solana the [Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) halted 
along with the Helium L1 blockchain during the migration. 

The Helium Foundation publicly queryable ETL instance of Helium L1 data has been shutdown and is
no longer available.

A full snapshot of the Helium L1 has been retained and uploaded for public availability; see
[Blockchain API](/solana/migration/blockchain-api) page for a torrent link.

Please consult the `#data-analysis` channel in the Helium Discord server if you
have questions on obtaining old data.

For ongoing insight into the operation of the Helium Network post-migration, please refer to the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) documentation.
