[Helium Vote][helium-vote] transitioned to using Solana SPL Governance [Realms][realms] at the time of the
migration to Solana. But has since migrated to use [Helium Modular Governance](https://modular-governance.helium.com) for all governance 
activities.

The results of all current and previous Helium votes are now at the [Heliumvote.][helium-vote] website.

Using the Helium Wallet app, users use the Governance Tab or the embedded browser to visit
[https://helium.vote][helium-vote], connect a Wallet, and vote yes/no on proposals. Ledger users, or
users of any other Solana Wallet, can also navigate to [https://helium.vote][helium-vote], connect a
wallet, and vote.

## Governance Changes

The major change with Solana governance is that more of the Helium Network can be governed by the
Helium Network and its subnetworks. Everything from Program (smart contract) changes to approving
Makers can now be controlled by the Helium DAO and its subnetworks.
