As a Hotspot Owner, you will not need to do anything for the migration. You do not need to power
your Hotspot off, you can leave it on and we'll do the rest!

If you use the Helium Wallet App, you will see it enter a "transitioning" state during the 24-hour
downtime of the Migration. Once the migration is complete, you can open the app again, and after a
minute or so you should see all of your assets and Hotspots.

## Reward Distribution

If you own a LoRaWAN Hotspot, you will now receive IOT tokens as mining rewards instead of HNT.

On Solana, rewards accumulate to the Hotspot, not directly to a wallet, and must be claimed. You can
claim as often as you would like, keeping in mind that for every claim you pay a small transaction
fee in SOL, that as of writing this is a fraction of a cent.

## Hotspot owners with 50+ hotspots

If you own a large number of Hotspots, it may take up to 48 hours after the migration to see all
Hotspots in your app.

Because claiming is an explicit action now, you may want to enlist a service to claim rewards on all
of your Hotspots.

## Hotspots on Solana

- Hotspots will move to the new Solana blockchain, specifically performing off-chain
  Proof-of-Coverage. More information on off-chain PoC can be found in
  [HIP-70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md#implementing-proof-of-coverage-oracles).
- Makers will push a fleet-wide update to all their Hotspots that switches a Hotspot to
  automatically beaconing by themselves every 6 hours and sending results to an Off-Chain Oracle.
- Makers must push this mandatory update to their fleet of Hotspots. Failure to do so will mean
  their customers cease to mine and stop earning rewards once the blockchain migration is complete.

### Hotspots Will Earn IOT

Hotspot Owners will start earning IOT as the blockchain migration will launch the IOT subnetwork. To
view IOT earned by your Hotspot, use the Helium Wallet app. 5G Hotspot Owners will continue earning
MOBILE and will additionally begin to earn IOT.

:::note 5G Hotspot Owners

Your 5G Hotspot will become an NFT, and your CBRS Radios will remain with a serial number, just like
before the Solana transition.

### Hotspots Become NFTs

All Helium Hotspots will be represented as NFTs on the Solana blockchain. Wallet migration is
required to view your Hotspot NFT(s) in the Helium Wallet app.
