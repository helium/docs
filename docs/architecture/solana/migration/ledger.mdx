## Installing the Helium-Solana App

Update your Ledger firmware to at least 2.1.0, perferably 2.4.x before you start.

As of now, we are still waiting on Ledger to release our app. Until then, to install you must follow
these steps:

1. Open Ledger Live.
2. Go to Settings (top right corner)
3. Click `Experimental Features`
4. Enable `Developer Mode`
5. Install the [Helium-Solana Ledger App](https://github.com/helium/app-helium-solana) as you normally would.
6. Close Ledger Live

## Migrating

The following utility will migrate all tokens from the Helium derivation path `44'/904'/n'/0'` to
the Solana derivation path `44'/501'/n'/0'`.

Ledger users will need to update their Helium Ledger App to a version that's pending release. This
upcoming version will use the Solana private key derivation path that moves all your tokens and
balances over to Solana. You may need to uninstall any Solana Ledger Apps during the Wallet
migration process.

## Migration Tool

Your public key will change on Solana, but the private key will remain the same. Note this app only
works with Chrome, Brave, or other Chromium-based web browsers.

- [Helium-Solana Ledger App](https://github.com/helium/app-helium-solana) now available from Ledger
  Live (ensure Developer Mode is enabled)
- [Solana Ledger App](https://support.ledger.com/article/360016265659-zd)
  using Ledger Live

:::note Close Ledger Live

**Before starting these steps, close the Ledger Live application or the transactions will fail.**

## Derivation Paths and your new Public Key

The Helium Ledger App uses `ED25519` keys, similarly to Solana, but at a different derivation path.

This means that, while seed phrases are the same, private keys are different on Solana.

In order to get around this, when you run the migration, the migration application will ask you to
use the old derivation path to approve sending all of your Hotspots, tokens, etc. to the new
derivation path.
