As a LoRaWAN Network user, you will not need to do anything during the migration. The network should
continue to function. Data transfer should be unaffected during the Solana Migration.

During the Solana Migration, users may still purchase Data Credits with a credit card on Console.
However, users will be unable to acquire DC through a direct HNT burn on Console. If you need
additional Data Credits and prefer to burn HNT, please consider doing so before the 4/18 Solana
Migration.

Core developers will actively monitor Network performance to ensure that systems stay operational.
If you believe that data transfer have been negatively impacted, please post the issue in the
#console channel in the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium).

<!-- TODO: Joey, maybe talk about Chirpstack and such? -->
