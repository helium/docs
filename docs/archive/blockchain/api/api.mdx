:::warning Deprecation Incoming

The Helium Blockchain API is being deprecated and should not be used for new projects.

Please refer to [Oracles](/oracles) and [Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) documentation for more
information on accessing data.

:::

## Endpoints

The Helium [blockchain API](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-http) serves up the blockchain from
a database that is filled by a [blockchain node](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) that
populates the database as blocks come in.

While anyone can run a node and a corresponding API, the Helium hosted version offers up the API
through two endpoints.

- **https://api.helium.wtf** — Beta, scalable endpoint for new features and tests. Currently
  connected to mainnet. This endpoint is used for feature development. Submitted transactions may
  get dropped.
- **https://api.helium.io** — Stable, scalable production service. Connected to mainnet.

### Specify a User-Agent

To access the helium api via script you will need to specify a valid `User-Agent` HTTP header field
identifying your agent, all requests made without a `User-Agent` header will result in an error
`429 Slow down gun powder!`.

## Routes

The API routes are grouped together in sub-pages of this page. Refer to the subpages for details.

## Cursors

In order to return data quickly and reduce the load on the API, a `cursor` may be returned from an
API request. The documentation for each route will indicate whether the result is paged with a
cursor.

In order to request the next page of results, add a cursor URL parameter to the URL that was used to
make the first request.

For example:

```text
export API_URL=https://api.helium.io
http get $(API_URL)/v1/blocks
```

will return a `data` array with _zero or more_ block results and a `cursor` field. To request the
next page:

```text
http get $(API_URL)/v1/blocks?cursor=eyJiZWZvcmUiOjQzOTIwMX0
```

Which will return the next page of results and a next `cursor` for the following page. A cursor will
be returned with each response until the last page is reached, at which point no cursor is returned.

:::info

In order to improve caching the API may return an empty data array and a cursor. Use the cursor to
request more data.

:::

## Transaction Units

All API endpoints which return a transaction value (i.e. `fee`, `amount`, etc) are represented in
the base unit `bones`.

The conversion rate is `100,000,000 bone` per `HNT`.
