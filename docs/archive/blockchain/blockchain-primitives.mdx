Below are some of the larger components and concepts of the Helium blockchain.

### Blocks

Blocks are used to record the most recent set of transactions in the Helium blockchain. Blocks are
mined based on time, as defined in the `block_time` chain variable. The current target block time is
`60000` milliseconds (or 60 seconds). During any given epoch, the most recent block consists of:

- Block Version
- Block Height
- Previous Block Hash
- Transactions (stored as a Merkle hash)
- Threshold signature from the current consensus group

The easiest way to see the blocks being mined is with the
[Helium Blockchain Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/). The
[Helium Mobile App](https://helium.com/app) also shows block details. Developers can also use the
Helium blockchain API to access all blockchain transactions and metadata.

<!--TODO: document epochs on Solana and in Helium rewards -->

### Chain Variables

Chain Variables, often referred to as `chain vars`, are a series of configuration settings for the
Helium blockchain. Chain Variables can be used to change things like target block time, target epoch
time, the minimum number of targets in a PoC Challenge, and much more. Chain Variables can be
altered by submitting a transaction containing the chain variable to be changed, its new value, and
a signature of the chain variable master key.

A full list of chain vars and their current values
[can be found here](https://helium.plus/chain-vars).

### Accounts, Wallets, and Keys

The Helium blockchain uses an account-based system for wallets and balances (similar to Ethereum and
others) as opposed to a UTXO-based ledger like Bitcoin blockchain. Users have several options for
creating Helium wallets and managing their private keys:

- If you’re using the [Helium Mobile Wallet](https://helium.com/app) (iOS, Android), your private
  key is encrypted locally (and can be recreated on another mobile device using the 12 word
  passphrase generated when your wallet was first created);
- Using the [Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs), users are responsible
  for creating, storing, and securing a wallet’s private key and associated passphrase;

Both the Helium Mobile Wallet and the CLI Wallet create and use keys based on the
[ed25519 public key signature system](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/). The CLI can also support NIST
p-256 keys. And the Helium blockchain supports both key types.
