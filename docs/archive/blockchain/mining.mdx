While there's no exact formula for calculating how much HNT you'll earn over a given period, there
are some higher-level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help better
explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these, as well as some mining and token
reward basics.

## How Do Hotspots Earn Helium Tokens?

The Helium Network rewards Hotspots for providing wireless coverage and verifying the Helium
Network. Helium has migrated to Solana. All LoRaWAN Hotspots now mine IOT, while HNT is emitted into
the subnetwork Treasury. IOT Holders can redeem their IOT for HNT. The redemption ratio is
calculated every day anew (in technical terms: at the end of each "epoch") as the ratio between the
amount of existing IOT tokens and the amount of HNT in the subnetwork Treasury at the time.

Every epoch, the current consensus group mines approximately 30 blocks on the blockchain. In each
block, Hotspots perform various types of work and are awarded according to the following
distribution:

| Reward Type           | Chain Variable            | Description                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PoC Beaconers         | `poc_challengees_percent` | Awarded to any Hotspot that successfully transmits a PoC beacon packet.                                         |
| Witnesses             | `poc_witnesses_percent`   | Distributed to selected Hotspots that witness a PoC beacon packet.                                              |
| Security              | `securities_percent`      | Awarded to Network investors who hold Security Tokens.                                                          |
| Network Data Transfer | `dc_percent`              | Distributed each epoch to Hotspots that route LoRaWAN sensor data for sensors on the Network during that epoch. |

**_Do I Have To Actively Participate to Earn Rewards Once My Hotspot is Deployed?_**

No. Once your Hotspot is completely deployed and onboarded to the Helium blockchain, you as the
owner are not required to do anything else to earn IOT. Your Hotspot will perform all of the above
activities on its own while it runs.

## Target HNT Production Per Epoch

As of August 1, 2021 (the most recent halving), the target production rate for new HNT minted per
month is `2,500,000`. This means that, if the blockchain performs as designed, it will produce
`2,500,000` HNT per month. This target rate is based on the following two parameters, as defined in
their specific chain variables:

- Target **block time** is `60` seconds.
- Target **epoch size** is `30` blocks.

Recall that, in the Helium blockchain, blocks contain some number of individual transactions, and
epochs are comprised of all the blocks mined by the current Consensus Group since the last epoch.

So, if the Network achieves its target block time of `60` seconds, and target epoch of `30` blocks,
the blockchain will produce `2,500,000` HNT per month. Per epoch, this equals roughly `1736.1111`
HNT. The math for this is as follows:

- `(43200 minutes per month / 30 minutes per epoch) = 1440 epochs per month`
- `(2500000 tokens minted per month / 1440 epochs per month) = 1736.1111 HNT per epoch`

### What Are The Current Block and Epoch Times?

At any point, you can go to the [Helium blockchain Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/) to view
recent block and epoch statistics, past HNT production numbers, and much more.

## HNT Distributions Per Epoch

As calculated above, the target HNT per epoch is approximately `1736.1111`. The next logical
question is, "Where does all this HNT go?" Let's take a look.

Below are the mining rewards per epoch as of August 1, 2022. For every complete epoch, marked by the
election of a new Consensus Group, all the HNT produced are distributed over the following reward
types:

| Reward Type           | Percentage       | HNT Earned by Reward Type |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| PoC Beaconers         | 4.73% - 12.665%  | 82.1181 - 219.7049        |
| Witnesses             | 18.92% - 49.345% | 328.4722 - 856.6840       |
| Consensus Group       | 6%               | 104.1667                  |
| Security Tokens       | 32%              | 555.5556                  |
| Network Data Transfer | _Up to 37.50%_   | _Up to 651.0417_          |
| **Total**             | **100%**         | **1736.1111**             |

**Rewards Change Over Time**

In the above table, you can see the maximum allotted rewards per reward type following HIP 10
(described below). The next maximum allotted rewards change is currently scheduled for **August 1,
2023** and will be updated along with changes related to the havening to maintain max HNT supply.

## HIP-10 and Variable HNT Rewards for Network Data Transfer

As noted above,
[HIP-10 was activated on August 24th, 2020](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0010-usage-based-data-transfer-rewards.md).

It ensures that HNT is rewarded at a rate of 1:1 to the amount of Data Credits (DCs) routed by any
given Hotspot per epoch. In doing so, the Network Data Transfer reward is proportional to the DC
spent in that epoch. This proportional relationship between Network Data Transfer reward type and DC
is capped at 37.50% (651.0417 HNT). Therefore, if the DC burned doesn't equal the value of
`651.0417` HNT, the remaining HNT is redistributed to the Proof of Coverage (PoC) rewards groups
pro-rata.

Here are a few examples to illustrate how this works in practice:

**Example 1: DC Burn does not exceed 37.50% HNT**

- In a given epoch, `8,000,000` DCs are transferred across the network
- The HNT Oracle Price is `$8.00`
- In this scenario, the total HNT value of DC transferred in this epoch is `10 HNT`. This
  calculation is:`(8,000,000 DC * $0.00001 / $8.00 HNT Oracle Price)`
- These `10 HNT` would be split proportionally to the Hotspots that did the work routing packets at
  the 1:1 rate.
- The remaining `641.0417` from the Network Data Transfer reward would be distributed by weight
  among the Witnesses and Beaconers.
  - `128.2083` to the Beaconer group => `4.73/(4.73+18.92) = 20%`
  - `512.8333` to the Witness group => `18.92/(4.73+18.92) = 80%`

**Example 2: DC Burn exceeds 37.50% HNT**

- In a given epoch, `800,000,000` DCs are spent on data transfer across the network
- The HNT Oracle Price is `$8.00`

In this scenario, the total HNT value of DC transferred in this epoch is `1000 HNT`. This
calculation is:`(800,000,000 DC * $0.00001 / $8.00 HNT Oracle Price)`

- Because the Network DC burn exceeded the `651.0417` available to the Network Data Transfer reward,
  all Hotspots that did the work over this epoch will split the full `1000 HNT` proportionally.

### Additional Notes on Reward Types and Payouts

- All Hotspots participating in PoC, including `Beaconers` and `Witnesses` will earn rewards
  proportional to how many events they participated in out of the total number of events per epoch.
- All Hotspots participating in `Network Data Transfer` will earn rewards proportional to their
  share of the total data transfer in that epoch, as shown above.
- Hotspots can earn one or more reward types during any given epoch.
- `PoC Beacon` and `Witness` reward types get distributed in the epoch that includes the
  corresponding PoC receipt.
- A Hotspots can earn more than one `PoC Beacon` and `Witness` reward per epoch.

## HNT Proration and Slow Block Times

The Helium blockchain is still new and growing quickly, so there are bugs to be squashed and
optimizations to be made. Target block and epoch times can be difficult to attain consistently. To
account for this, the Helium blockchain uses something called `proration` to ensure that the target
of `2,500,000` is achieved even if block and epoch times aren't on target.

**Target HNT Depends on Blocks, Not Clocks**

It's easiest to think of target HNT production over one month. If the blockchain performs on target,
resulting in roughly 1440 epochs per month, then `2,500,000` new HNT will be produced. "One month"
is a period of time measured by a clock. However, under the hood, we use block time, and the
resulting epochs, to mark HNT production against our target. So when blocks are slow, HNT production
is reduced proportionally.

### What Happens to HNT When Block Times are Slow?

Occasionally, due to the rapid growth of the network, there can be less-than-optimal block times.
This results in slower epochs. When this happens the blockchain will produce **less** HNT over the
same period of time. This may seem counterintuitive. _Shouldn't the blockchain produce more HNT when
block times are slower to ensure the `2,500,000` per month target is hit?_ No. Again, think blocks,
not clocks. Here's a step-by-step example to make it clearer:

- Let's assume for a given `60` minute period, the average block time was `120` seconds (which is
  double the target of `60` seconds).
- This would mark `30` blocks over the `60` minute period, conclude an epoch, and result in HNT
  rewards being distributed.
- As with any epoch, we would distribute the target of (approximately) `1736.1111` HNT.
- However, since this epoch took twice as long as normal - `60` minutes versus `30` minute target -
  the blockchain essentially distributes HNT at **half the normal rate**.

### When Block Times Slow Down, Everyone Earns Less

The most important takeaway here is that, when block times slow and HNT production is reduced,
everyone participating in the Network - Witnesses, Security Token Holders, etc. - **is impacted
equally** (except for Consensus Group members; more on this below). So, although it's annoying that
the effective rate of HNT may have dropped over a given period of time, know that you're not the
only one earning less. And this is by design.

### Consensus Groups and Slow Block Times

The only group that doesn't see its HNT reduced per epoch when blocks are slow is the Consensus
Group. Currently, there are 43 members of each Consensus Group, sharing 6% of the HNT produced per
epoch.

This amount stays fixed while every other category of HNT payout is prorated so that members of the
Consensus Groups are incentivized to keep elections fast. Otherwise, a malicious Consensus Group
member might be inclined to prolong elections. This could be done, for example, to prevent a
subsequent election, thus ensuring current membership in the Consensus Group stays intact. By
distributing a fixed amount of HNT per `30` block epoch (as opposed to prorating payouts), we remove
the incentive to disrupt elections.
