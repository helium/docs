A trustless and decentralized way to allow coverage providers and coverage users to exchange value
is core to the Helium Network.

Packet purchasing is implemented on the Helium Blockchain with two specific primitives:

- Organizationally Unique Identifiers
- State Channels

## Organizationally Unique Identifier

Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs) are registered identities on the Helium Blockchain. To
send and receive packets to an end-device, a network user needs to be serviced an OUI. This can be
their own OUI or one operated by a third party, such as [Console](/network-iot/console) operated by
Helium Foundation.

An OUI has some specificities related to LoRaWAN and packet routing,
[documented here](/lorawan-on-helium#the-oui), but with respect to the blockchain, what's important
is that
[only libp2p addresses registered as endpoints for the OUI](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_oui_v1.proto#L6)
may open and close state channels on behalf of an OUI.

For example,
[this account](https://explorer-old.helium.com/accounts/13tyMLKRFYURNBQqLSqNJg9k41maP1A7Bh8QYxR13oWv7EnFooc)
[purchased the first OUI](https://explorer-old.helium.com/txns/6ACW9A5Hj3KDnOJELWAvAVG3yM71OpNAYpdAPM3ti1A)
on the Helium Blockchain. The address `112qB3YaH5bZkCnKA5uRH7tBtGNv2Y5B4smv1jsmvGUzgKT71QpE`
operates the OUI on behalf of the owner. You can monitor its activity
[here](https://explorer-old.helium.com/accounts/14oSuAgRmAFPFPZRY1MUwir5AJSLGkaXHzuSZJ92BuYCfLMN1Et).

OUIs are purchased (see current [fee schedule](/iot-transaction-fees#transaction-fee-schedule)) and
numbered in incrementing order. You can query the API for a list of existing OUIs using
[the following endpoint](/archive/api/blockchain/ouis#list-ouis).

## State Channels

State channels are side-chains opened by OUI operators (any of the libp2p addresses registered to
the OUI). With an
[`state_channel_open`](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_state_channel_open_v1.proto)
transaction, the operator stakes two times the amount of Data Credits (DC) available to be spent in
the channel. In addition, the amount of blocks until channel expiration is configured.

Once a state channel is opened, hotspots and OUIs operators are able to transact within the channel.
Generally, the flow is as follows:

- a packet is offered by a hotspot to the OUI operator, with some metadata but without the actual
  payload
- the OUI operator decides whether to purchase the packet; if it decides to purchase, the offer is
  signed
- the packet is delivered by the hotspot to the OUI operator

These signed offers are added to the state channel "banner", which allows the device to confirm that
it is being given credit for its work during the lifetime of the state channel. This is possible
even as many other hotspots have their own transactions added to the same banner.

Sometime before the expiration block, the OUI operator will submit a
[`state_channel_close`](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_state_channel_close_v1.proto)
transaction channel, a transaction which also shows how many data credits are being burned in the
name of which hotspots. Should a hotspot not be credited the appropriate amount, it has recourse
during a "grace period" the ten blocks after the closure to file a dispute, using the signed offers
as evidence. This is done in the form of alternate state channel close transactions.

If there is no overspend or disputes, the second half of the stake and any remaining credit is
returned to the OUI operator. Otherwise, the entire stake is kept and, in the event of a dispute,
the appropriate amount of data credit burns are attributed to the hotspots with valid disputes.

Should the operator neglect to close the state channel before the expiration block, closes by all
parties are still accepted during the ten block grace period. Should the OUI operator still neglect
to close the channel, they will lose their whole stake.
