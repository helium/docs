### Configuring Alerts

To configure alerts from the Flows workspace, select a Device/Label node or Integration node
depending on the type of alert to configure and select the Inspector tab.

Select an existing alert or create a new one.

To create a new one, select Create New Alert choose a name, alert type (email, webhook), and the
alert.

the side menu and copying relevant webhook key.
