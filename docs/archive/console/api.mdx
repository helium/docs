# Console API

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

The Console API lets you interact with the console via HTTP Requests. You can either do that
directly using the HTTP API or you can leverage the CLI, which abstracts the API and provides higher
level features like importing devices from other network providers.
