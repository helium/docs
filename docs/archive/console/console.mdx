# Helium Console

The [Helium Console](http://console.helium.com/) is a web-based device management tool hosted by the
Helium Foundation that allows developers to register, authenticate, and manage their devices on the
Helium network. In addition to device management, Console provides prebuilt connections called
Integrations to route device data via HTTPs or MQTT; or directly to cloud services like AWS IoT.

Device Management includes:

- Flows: a visual-centric view of the key elements in Console and allows users to instantly
  understand the relationship among devices, functions, and integrations.
- Organization structure with labels, and user-level permissions
- Device ID registration and seamless, secure onboarding and authentication
- Data Credits for utilizing the Helium Network

Console is available as a free to use hosted application for demo and educational purposes (up to 10
devices) at [console.helium.com](https://console.helium.com).

Console hosted by the Helium Foundation provides a way for users to easily onboard and test or demo
devices on the Helium Network. It is capped at 10 devices and a single Organization. For large
deployments and commercial use, users should consider Console Hosting Providers in the ecosystem
