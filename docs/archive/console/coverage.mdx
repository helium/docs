Coverage provides visibility for Hotspots that transfer device packets as well as the status of
those Hotspots within Console.

## Identify Hotspots that hear devices

Coverage makes it easy to identify which Hotspots have transferred an organization’s device packets.
The `Coverage Breakdown` list is automatically populated with Hotspots that have sent traffic in the
last 24 hrs for devices belonging to the Organization.

:::info

Only Hotspots that have successfully transferred packets are displayed on the Coverage Breakdown
tab. To show all Hotspots on this tab within range of the device, turn on Multiple Packets
[here](/console/profiles/) and choose to purchase all packets. Assuming there is sufficient Data
Credit balance, Console will purchase packets from all the Hotspots that heard the device and
display them.

:::

`My Hotspots` is a simple way to filter and view only Hotspots users want to see. Select the flag
icon next to a Hotspot name for it to appear in the My Hotspots list.

If a Hotspot has not transferred data but is still of interest, simply navigate to `Hotspot Search`
run a search for it, and it will appear in the My Hotspots list. Users can also use a wallet address
and all Hotspots associated with that wallet address will appear.

## Monitoring Hotspots stats and status

Coverage displays a number of Hotspots details including Hotspot location, packets transferred, and
number of devices that it’s “seen”.

Simply click a Hotspot name to view more detailed Hotspot stats. Depending on the tab, users can
display overall stats (`Statistics` tab) or a list of the devices heard from the last 24 hours with
the `My Devices Heard` tab.

Clicking any device name takes users to the specific device page for more details.

## Create Hotspot Aliases

Coverage allows users to easily create an alias for easier identification of the Hotspot. Click a
Hotspot name, then under its animal name, click `No Alias` to define an Alias.

## Group Hotspots

The Coverage feature allows users to create Hotspot groups for easy management. To be added to a
group, Hotspots must initially be followed and appear in the My Hotspots area. To add Hotspots to
`My Hotspot` list check [here](/console/coverage#identify-hotspots-that-hear-devices).

### Creating a Hotspot group

- On the left-hand menu, choose **Coverage**.
- Under `My Hotspot Groups`, click **+ Create Hotspot Group**, and enter the group name (minimum 3
  characters).

### Adding a Hotspot to a group

Before a Hotspot can be added to a group it must be followed and appear in the `My Hotspots` list.

- Under `My Hotspots`, select the desired Hotspot row, and under the `Groups` column click and
  choose the name of the desired Group to add the Hotspot. Note: Hotspots can belong in multiple
  groups.

### Removing a Hotspot from a group

A Hotspot can easily be removed from a group. Note: this action only removes the Hotspot from the
group, and it will continue to appear in the `My Hotspots` list.

- Under `My Hotspots Group`, click the Group that includes the Hotspot(s) you want to remove.
- Select the row of the Hotspot to remove and under the `Groups` column click the blue check next to
  the group name. The Hotspot is removed from the group. Note: Hotspots can belong in multiple
  groups.

### Modifying groups

Groups can be renamed or deleted.

- Under `My Hotspots Group`, click the Group you want to:
  - Rename: Click **Rename Hotspot Group**, type the name, and click **Submit**.
  - Delete: Click **Delete Hotspot Group**. A confirmation message appears with Hotspots in the
    group. Click **Submit** to delete the group. Note: Hotspots in a deleted group will continue to
    appear in the `My Hotspots` list, and this action only deletes the group.
