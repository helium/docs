Frequent actions performed from the Flows workspace include the following:

- creating node elements
- adding nodes to the workspace
- accessing debug mode
- viewing the inspector

### Creating Node Elements

To use Flows the node elements (devices, labels, integrations, and functions) must already have been
created.

To create any node element from the Flows workspace, click the **+** circle and choose the desired
node element.

### Adding Nodes to the Workspace

Important the core node elements must have been previously created before you can add them to the
workspace (for info on creating node elements go here).

To add nodes to the workspace, go to the Nodes list, click **+**.

tab.
