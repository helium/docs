You can now execute functions on Console! With the Decoder Function, users can transform and/or
parse a raw payload before it is posted to an endpoint.

When a Decoder Function is applied to a device or integration, the Decoder Function code is executed
on the payload sent by the device, and the result is passed to the Integration. The Decoder Function
can be written using custom JavaScript code provided by the user or selected from prebuilt decoders
\(currently Browan Object Locator and Cayenne LPP\).

Console decoders are compatible with The Things Network \(TTN\) decoders, which are already
available for a wide variety of devices.

In addition to creating a custom decoder, Helium maintains a
[growing list of community-created functions](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders).

## A Primer on Encoding and Decoding

LoRaWAN networks are, by design, low bandwidth. Thus, developers make the most out of every byte
sent over the air. Developers also shouldn't send inefficient types like characters and strings. For
example, to represent a single English letter with the widely used ASCII encoding standard, you have
to use an entire byte. This makes sense if your data can only be stored as English words, but in the
case of IoT devices, there is often only the need to store numeric values. For every transmission,
we want to pack as much information into as few bytes as possible. Because of this, there are
special encoding standards specifically made for sending common IoT device data such as
[CayenneLPP](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload).

These types of standards allow you to easily encode your data much more efficiently. Once your data
has been received over the air by the network, there is no longer the necessity of encoding the data
with a standard that can make it more challenging for humans to interpret.

**Function Decoders** allow you to decode your device data within the Helium Console so that you can
interpret it for debugging issues and/or translate \(decode\) it before sending it to your
application/service via an Integration \(e.g., HTTP\).

## Creating a Decoder Function

:::info **Decoder Library on GitHub**

If you have purchased an off-the-shelf device, it is likely that there already exists a decoder you
can use! We have a [repository](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders) that contains decoders
for a number of popular devices.

:::

To begin creating a new function within the Helium Console, select Functions from the left side
navigation. Then create a new Function by clicking the Add New Function **+** icon. [IMAGE]

Name your new Function, select "Decoder" as Function Type, and "Custom Script" as Format if you want
to enter your own script, or select from the predefined decoders.

Next we need to enter the JavaScript that will decode our payloads for us. The Script Validator
allows you to easily test inputs in hexadecimal form to ensure that your script will run
successfully.

### Decoder Function Definition

The decoder function parameters will include the device uplink payload as an array of bytes and the
uplink port. You can return any valid type value which will then be used at the decoder output.

```text
function Decoder(bytes, port) {

  return decoded;
}
```

### Decoder Function Output

The data returned by your function decoder will be included in an additional decoded.payload field
in the standard [JSON message](integrations/json-schema), it will not alter the original payload
field. An example of the decoded field is shown below.

```text
"decoded": {
 "payload": {
   "BatV": 3.039,
   "Ext_sensor": "Temperature Sensor",
   "Hum_SHT": "53.8",
   "TempC_DS": "327.67",
   "TempC_SHT": "24.58"
  },
 "status": "success"
},
```

### Attaching Functions

You need to attach functions to:

- a device or a group of devices (via a label): the function is only applied to the device payload
  in the Debug utility.

- a device or group of devices (via a label) and an integration: the function is applied to payloads
  before being sent to the integration.

Easily attach functions to devices, labels, and integations in the
[Flows Workspace](/console/flows).
