# Adafruit IO

[Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) is a powerful but simple to use Internet of Things platform
from Adafruit. It makes data from devices useful by allowing you to display, respond, and interact
with it. You can sign up for a free account at [https://io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com/).

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **Adafruit IO** integration as shown below.

The next step is to enter your Adafruit IO username and key. These can be found by visiting
[https://io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com/) and clicking _MyKey_ in the top right corner as
shown below.

You will then be presented with both your username and key as shown below.

Copy these values into the username and key fields in Console for the integration configuration
shown below.

Last for this step, you can optionally change the group name that is set to `{{device_id}}` by
default. The group name is used to group one or more data values that is received from a device and
sent to AdafruitIO in a single message. This name is used as the default because it is guaranteed to
be unique for every Helium device. You can use any of the available template tags which are auto
populated when messages are actually sent, which are `{{device_id}}`, `{{device_eui}}`, and
`{{device_name}}`. This integration uses group topics to send device data to AdafruitIO over MQTT,
you can read more about it [here](https://io.adafruit.com/api/docs/mqtt.html#group-topics).

Next, let's name the integration in step 3. You will use this name to identify the integration when
attaching it to devices.

The very last step is to select the decoder that will be used to decode the data payload received
from your device. We suggest using the _CayenneLPP_ decoder as shown below and encoding your data
with CayenneLPP as this will be a seamless experience and not require any further configuration on
Console. You can learn more about CayenneLPP encoding
[here ](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload)as well
as find an Arduino library for it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/cayennelpp/).
If you are comfortable with writing your own decoder and template then simply select _Custom_ and
then search for your function decoder. Last be sure to click _Create Integration_ to finish.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Workspace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

Quick video tutorial connecting devices to an integration
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnERw1f7TGE).

:::

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows [here](/console/flows/).
