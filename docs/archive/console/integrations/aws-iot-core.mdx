# AWS IoT Core

[AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/) is a powerful offering that lets developers build
device-based applications and services on the AWS Cloud. And this Integration via Helium Console
automates the complexity of securely connecting your devices to AWS IoT Core.

### Add an AWS IoT Core Integration

To add an **AWS IoT Core Integration**, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **AWS IoT Core** integration:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-select-aws-iot-core.png')} />

The next step is to create a new user with limited permissions that this Integration will use.

Open up the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

Under the Services menu in the upper-left, go to **Security, Identity, & Compliance**-&gt;**IAM**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-iam.png')} />

We are now going to create a new **User:**

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user.png')} />

Set the user name to "**HeliumIntegrationAccess**" and select only "**Programmatic access**"

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user-details.png')} />

We now attach a policy to the newly created user that defines what permissions they hold.

Select "**Attach existing policies directly**" and type "**AWSIoTConfigAccess"** into the "**Filter
Policies**" box and check the box to the left of the row:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user-attach-policy.png')}
/>

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user-success.png')} />

:::warning

Ensure you record and store these keys securely, as you will not have an opportunity to get access
to them again!

:::

Back in the **Helium Console**, enter the credentials we just created under **AWS Connection
Details,** as well as the AWS region that you would like AWS IoT to run in.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-enter-details.png')} />

The **Topic** field is the AWS IoT MQTT topic that this integration will publish uplink messages to,
from devices.

Finally, we give our new Integration a name and click **Create Integration**. Your new Integration
is now ready for use.

### Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Worskpace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

:::info

Quick video tutorial connecting devices to an integration
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnERw1f7TGE).

:::

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows [here](/console/flows/).

## AWS IoT MQTT Topic composition:

### Device Uplink \(Receive Data from Device\)

This topic is defined in the **Topic** field when creating the AWS IoT intgeration.

**Subscribe to:** `{custom_topic}`

### Device Downlink \(Send Data to Device\)

**Publish to:** `helium/devices/{Device ID}/down`

Example: `helium/devices/4f10d99a-e22e-4007-a3f0-6af3bc63acfe/down`

## AWS IoT MQTT Messages

To send data to a device, use JSON with a `payload_raw` field with a base64 encoded string.

**Sending Data to Device \(Downlink\):**

```javascript
{
   "payload_raw": "encoded_string"
}
```

When receiving data from a device, the messages will be in JSON and look like the following. The
data from the device is in the `payload` field, and is a base64 encoded string.

**Receiving data from Device \(Uplink\):**

```javascript
{
  "app_eui": "06B02F1A0E482128",
  "dev_eui": "5F67F99E10B47006",
  "devaddr": "1A2FB006",

}
```

### Viewing Integration in AWS IoT Core

Once our devices have been connected on the Flows Worskpace to our new Integration, let's return to
the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), and go to **IoT Core** under the **Services**
menu:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-find-services.png')} />

Here you are able to monitor the connections to AWS:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-monitor.png')} />

When data comes in from the Helium Network Integration, Things will be automatically created within
AWS IoT Core:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-things.png')} />

Going to **Interact** on the left while on a **Thing** takes us to a list of topics for interacting
with the **Thing Shadows**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-interact.png')} />

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-topics.png')} />

To monitor in real-time what is being sent to AWS from Helium, we can open the **MQTT monitor**, and
subscribe to a topic with "\#" wildcard \(to catch all messages, or use the topic we set in **Helium
Console** if just wanting to monitor those\).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-mqtt-client.png')} />

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-mqtt-message.png')} />

The payload field is the actual data received from the device,
[encoded in a base64](https://www.base64decode.org/) string.

### Integration Details

View the details of your integration by clicking on the Integration name.

**Integration Details** shows the integration ID that is unique to each integration, the name, the
type of integration, and whether it is active or not.

**Devices Piped** lists all the devices that are currently sending their data to the selected
integration.

**Update your AWS Connection Details** allows you to update your AWS connection details for the
currently viewed integration.
