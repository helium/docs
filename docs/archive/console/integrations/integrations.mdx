# Integrations

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

Integrations enable devices to connect to pre-configured, cloud-based applications or send data
directly over HTTP or MQTT.

Community Integrations have been submitted to the Console Marketplace, approved by the Helium
Foundation and chosen by the Console Hosting Provider.

To learn more about the Console Marketplace and submitting an Integration, go
[here](/network-iot/console-marketplace).

If an Integration is not available please contact your provider. By default, the Helium Foundation
Console will enable all approved Integrations.

:::important

Pre-Marketplace Integrations will continue to work as expected. However, devices or groups will need
to connect to a new Community Integration to benefit from future updates provided by the Marketplace
Integration developer.

A number indicates that an Integration has been added.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Worskpace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows [here](/network-iot/console/flows/).
