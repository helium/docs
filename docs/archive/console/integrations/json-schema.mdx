# JSON Schema

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'
import LegacyContentBanner from '@site/src/theme/LegacyContentBanner'

<LegacyContentBanner />

When receiving or transmitting data with an integration, there is a consistent JSON Schema for the
data.

## Uplink: Receiving Data from a Device

Here is an example of data received:

## Downlink: Transmitting Data to a Device

Here is an example of data received:

```text
{
    "payload_raw": "SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==",
    "port": 1,
    "confirmed": false
}
```

| Field           | Description |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **payload_raw** | String      | Data transmitted to your device as a base64 encoded String. Most programming languages will have some built-in libraries for parsing/encoding this \(e.g., Python's `payload = base64.b64encode(payload_str.encode('utf-8')).decode('ascii')`\) |
| **port**        | Number      | LoRaWAN FPort on which the data is to be transmitted; this can be useful for routing data within the application                                                                                                                                |
| **confirmed**   | Bool        | Whether a device acknowledgement (ACK) is required                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note that many devices will show the downlinked payload (submitted as base64 in the JSON schema) as
hex (base-16).

### Clearing a Device Queue

If the **payload_raw** field is set to the base64 encoded value `'__clear_downlink_queue__'`, all
downlinks queued for that device will be removed.
