Labels are used to group devices for better organization allowing flexibility as your projects scale
and grow. Think of a label as simply a group of devices.

## Organizing with Labels

Labels are simply user-defined identifiers that can be attached to one or more devices. Also
multiple labels can be added to a single device so users can choose to identify devices based on
attributes such as geography \(e.g. `SF`\) and device type \(e.g. `temperature` or `humidity`\).

## Add Labels

During device creation you can add an existing label or create a new one.

Alternatively you can create labels beforehand.

To add a new label, on the Devices page click the Add New Label icon.

The following screen appears.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/console-add-label.png')} />

## Attaching Labels

Labels can be attached to devices during or after creation. If you would like to attach a label to a
device during creation, make sure to create the label beforehand, and it will be available to
select.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/console-add-device-label.png')} />

To attach a label after creating a new device, go to the specific device details page and click the
Add Label button. You can choose an existing label from the dropdown list or create a label.

To attach a label to a device from the Flows workspace check
[here](/console/flows/actions#add-labels-to-devices).

## Label Configurations

Label and device configurations (Alerts, ADR, Packets, CF List) have been updated, go
[here](/console/profiles/) for information about how to configure these settings.
