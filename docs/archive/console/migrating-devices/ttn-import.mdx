# Import Devices From The Things Network

Helium Console now supports importing devices from The Things Network directly from the web
interface.

This guide will walk you through the process of migrating devices from TTN over to Helium. As you'll
see the, process is quite painless.

## Starting the Import Process

To get started, open up the [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) and switch to the
Organization that you want to import the devices into:

Next, select "Devices" on the left-hand menu and click the Add New Device **+** button.

Click the "Import from the Things Network" button.

## Retrieving a TTN Access Code

Next we need to retrieve a code from The Things Network that will allow us to manage devices
programatically.

Go to [https://account.thethingsnetwork.org](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/) and enter your
TTN Console credentials.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-login.png')} />

At this point, you should be taken to our account page on the TTN Console. Click the link directly
beneath your avatar, and you will be given a `ttnctl access code` that should be valid for the next
five minutes.

Copy this code over to our _Import Devices_ page back on the Helium Console and click the "Start
Importing Devices" button!

## Select the devices to Migrate

Next, select the devices you want to migrate from The Things Network to the Helium Network. We
encourage you to move them all.

As shown in the screenshot above, we include the option to auto-create a
[Helium label ](../labels#organizing-with-labels)based on the TTN Application name. As you'll see
momentarily, his can be very convenient and is recommended.

We can also delete the devices from The Things Network so that your device will no longer attempt to
join TTN rather than Helium.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-label.png')} />

Now we simply click the "Import Devices" button, and wait a few seconds as the devices are pulled
over into your Helium Console!

In the example migrated device below, you can see the attached label that was created from the TTN
Application name.

Once your devices are organized using Labels, you can address them programmatically via the Console
API.

And you're done. That is all that it takes to migrate devices from The Things Network over to The
People's Network!
