# Packets Configurations

<LegacyContentBanner />

The Multiple Packets menu has been replaced with Packet Configurations.

Packet Configurations allow users to specify settings that impact packet delivery and includes
settings for both Multiple Packets and Preferred Hotspots.

:::important

For a Packet Configurations setting, users can either set a Preferred Hotspot or a Multiple Packet
setting, but not both.

:::

## Preferred Hotspots

With this feature users can designate Hotspots as “Preferred”. If the feature is enabled, packets
will ONLY be accepted by Hotspots chosen as Preferred. In the Coverage section, Hotspots must be
followed first before they can be designated as Preferred.

After configured, Packet Configurations can be applied on the Flows workspace at a device/label
level on the Packets tab.

As this feature is designed for troubleshooting Hotspots or initial Hotspot positioning, the default
setting is off.

:::warning

This feature is designed for initial Hotspot positioning or troubleshooting. If this feature is
enabled and a preferred Hotspot cannot send packets, then no packet transfer will occur even if
other non-Preferred Hotspots are in range.

:::

### How to designate a Preferred Hotspot

The following steps are required to designed Preferred Hotspots:

Step 1: On Coverage choose the desired Hotspot. Hotspots must be first followed before they can be
chosen as Preferred.

Step 2: On Packet Configuration, choose the Preferred Hotspot settings.

Step 3: On the Flows Workspace, apply the Packet setting to a device or group of devices.

### Multiple Packets

Data Credits are only spent for uplinks including initial join packets. The Multiple Packets feature
provides the ability to pay for additional packets for redundancy and location triangulation
purposes.
