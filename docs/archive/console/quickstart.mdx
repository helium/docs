# Console Quickstart

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'
import LegacyContentBanner from '@site/src/theme/LegacyContentBanner'

<LegacyContentBanner />

## Objective

This Console quickstart guide will cover how to:

- Register an account on Helium Console
- Add a device to Helium Console and record device details

:::info

The cost per packet is $0.00001 USD \(24 byte packets\) which is equivalent to 1 Data Credit \(DC\).
For more information please go [here](/tokens/data-credit).

:::

## Create an account

To register for an account, visit [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and click **Sign
Up**.

During registration, you'll be asked to provide an Organization name. For more information about
Organizations go [here](/console/users#organizations).

Define an Organization name for the top level owner of the account \(i.e. company name\).

### Confirm your account

A confirmation email will be sent to the email address used to create an account. You must confirm
the account in order to continue using Console. If you did not receive an email, please check your
spam folders.

## Device Management

Helium Console allows developers to add devices and grab the device identifiers to load onto their
device firmware that authenticates and identifies the device for the Helium Network.

### Add a Device

To add a device, go to **Devices** and click the **+ Add Device** icon on the top right of the
window.

When prompted, enter a name for your device. Device names do not have to be unique \(as every device
will be given a unique identifier generated by Console\). `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey` are auto
generated by the Helium Console when you create a new device. However, you can input your own
`DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey` if your device is already provisioned with these credentials.

:::important

Helium Console users are capped at ONE (1) Organization and 10 devices for their account.

If your account as of March 31, 2022 exceeds this cap, you can continue using Helium Console with
those existing devices and Orgs for 12 calendar months, but will not be able to add additional
devices and Orgs.

To continue with more than 1 Org / 10 devices after 12 months, you will need to work with a member
of the ecosystem, host your own instance, or contact a team members at sales@nova-labs.com.

\*While an account is in an overage state with > 1 Org / 10 devices and a device or Org is deleted,
additional devices or Orgs cannot be re-added.

Users over the cap who would like to immediately add more devices/Organizations, or users who have
not yet exceeded the cap but plan to do so, can reach out to members of the ecosystem, host their
own instance, or contact sales@nova-labs.com.

Once added, you'll see a consolidated view of all your device details, as well as the Activation
Method \(only `OTAA` is currently supported\) and the LoRaWAN US Channels used by the Helium Network
\(which will always be `sub-band 2`\).

## Live Data and Event Logs

When a valid data packet is received from that device, a dot will appear from the left side of the
chart and flow towards the right as time goes on.

Blue dots represent packets that have been successfully sent to endpoints, while orange dots have
failed to reach an endpoint, and red dots do not have a defined endpoint.

The size of the dot is related to the size of the packet. Larger sized packets will be a larger dot,
and small data packets will be a smaller dot.

### Event Log

Event Logs display real-time packets in table form. There's different categories including Uplinks,
Downlinks, Join Request/Accept, Acknowledge. Here you can see size of packet, Port, and Devaddr. In
addition, which Hotspot(s) received the packet, its RSSI, SNR, Frequency, Spreading Factor and time
of receipt. As well as Integration success or failure messages.

The Event Log also provides a filter to display dropped uplinks, and allows users to filter events
w/commands.

The information in the Event Log can also exported as a JSON file.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices can be directly connected to integrations.

To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply define an integration and attach
a device to it on the Flows workspace. Integrations need to be created before they're available. You
can use Labels to group devices together for easy identification and management read more on labels
[here](/console/labels).

## Next Steps

Now that you have learned how to add a device on Console it's time to get an actual device
connected. We have several quickstart guides for some of the most popular development and ready to
use devices [here](/iot/devices).
