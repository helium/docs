Full Hotspots are Helium coverage providers that can participate in all potential reward activity
available to Hotspots. Compared to a [Data Only Hotspots](/iot/data-only-hotspots), Full Hotspots
are eligible for [Proof-of-Coverage](/iot/proof-of-coverage) Rewards.

Full Hotspots may only be manufactured by approved **Makers**. These are hardware vendors that have
been approved by the Helium community and the [Helium Foundation](https://helium.foundation). This
process is governed via
[Helium Improvement Proposal 19 (HIP-19)](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md).

## Approved Makers

Nova Labs (formerly known as Helium Systems, Inc) was the first Hotspot manufacturer. Starting in
early 2019, they produced the first hardware capable of mining HNT and providing LoRaWAN wireless
coverage. In total, Nova Labs produced and sold the first 13,000 Hotspots to the Helium community to
seed the Network.

Since the introduction of
[HIP-19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md), additional
approved Makers have been added. Each approved Maker is given a unique onboarding address on the
Helium blockchain where they are required to [burn data credits](/iot/transaction-fees) to onboard
their unique Hotspots before they are granted access to the blockchain.
