# IoT Hotspots

In comparison to an IoT [Data-Only Hotspot](/iot/data-only-hotspots), which only gets rewarded for
data transfer activity, Proof-of-Coverage enabled Hotspots are eligible for rewards from coverage
beaconing and witnessing as well as data transfer rewards.

Hotspots may only be manufactured by approved **Makers**. These are hardware vendors that have been
approved by the Helium community and the [Helium Foundation](https://helium.foundation). This
process is governed via
[Helium Improvement Proposal 19 (HIP-19)](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md).
Makers have been unapproved when they fail to comply with HIP 19 and contractual requirements.

## Current Approved Makers

Nova Labs (formerly known as Helium Systems, Inc) was the first Hotspot manufacturer. Starting in
early 2019, they produced the first hardware capable of mining HNT and providing LoRaWAN wireless
coverage. In total, Nova Labs produced and sold the first 13,000 Hotspots to the Helium community to
seed the Network.

Since the introduction of
[HIP-19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md), additional
approved Makers have been added. Each approved Maker is given a unique onboarding address on the
Helium blockchain where they are required to burn data credits to onboard their unique Hotspots
before they are granted access to the blockchain.

Currently, approved Makers are
