# Debug With Sniffer

<LegacyContentBanner />

Confirm router runtime behavior using a virtual LoRaWAN device with a software-based protocol
sniffer.

## Dependencies

1. Ensure [Router](https://github.com/helium/router.git) is running and
   [Console](https://github.com/helium/console.git) is connected to it.
2. The wallet to be used requires enough HNT to burn for joining the virtual device to the network.
   - It's the same fee as for a physical device.
   - See [Setup Data Only Hotspot](/iot/data-only-hotspots#transactions--cost)
3. Clone each of these repos:
   - [virtual-lorawan-device](https://github.com/helium/virtual-lorawan-device)
   - [lorawan-sniffer](https://github.com/helium/lorawan-sniffer)
   - [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs)
   - [helium-wallet-rs](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs)

Those packages require [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) when building from source. You will also need
to install [Cmake](https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html). If some of
the following commands fail, try using sudo.

Everything may run locally on a laptop/workstation, or use just the Rust-based tools locally for
connecting to a remote Router & Console.

## Overview

The approximate sequence:

1. Create a virtual device
2. Use the wallet to pay for joining a device to the network
3. Device gets added via Console, which then will be "pending" for about 15 minutes
4. Start local data-only hotspot
5. Configure sniffer to use that hotspot
6. Connect the virtual device to sniffer
7. Wait for "pending" to resolve on Console
8. Finally, the virtual device joins the network

Order of operations below is significant.

# Setup

## Compile

Because there are multiple repos each in their own subdirectory, examples below assume everything is
located beneath the `~/helium/` path.

Ensure everything compiles successfully.

Run:

```bash
cd ~/helium/

git clone https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs.git
cd helium-wallet-rs/
cargo build --release

cd ..

git clone https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs.git
cd gateway-rs/
cargo install cargo-make
cargo build --release

cd ..

git clone https://github.com/helium/virtual-lorawan-device.git
cd virtual-lorawan-device/
cargo build --release

cd ..

git clone https://github.com/helium/lorawan-sniffer.git
cd lorawan-sniffer/
cargo build --release
```

Those may be built in any order but are in sequence as used below.

## Confirm Wallet Balance

Later steps require the command-line interface (CLI) version of a wallet.

For using a wallet already attached to an existing hotspot, that wallet can be
[connected](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs#create-a-wallet) to this one using the
`--seed` option.

Run:

```bash
cd ~/helium/helium-wallet-rs/
./target/release/helium-wallet create basic
```

Follow its [README](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) or other
[instructions](/iot/data-only-hotspots/) for creating and **funding this wallet**.

View details of the _funded_ CLI wallet:

```bash
./target/release/helium-wallet info
```

See `Balance` field, and confirm having enough HNT to burn 1000000 (six zeros) data credits. One
whole HNT is more than sufficient with prevailing exchange rates in early 2022.

Copy the value from the `Address` field: `WalletADDRESS...` will be used as the example in excerpts
below.

## Join Hotspot To Network

Use the `WalletADDRESS...` from the earlier wallet "info" command.

Arguments to both the owner and payer options will be your wallet address (as with a self-signed
certificate).

As of v1.0, gateway-rs requires running in server-mode in the background:

```bash
cd ~/helium/gateway-rs/
./target/release/helium_gateway server &
gw_pid=$!
```

Generate transaction:

```bash
./target/release/helium_gateway add --mode dataonly \
    --owner WalletADDRESS... \
    --payer WalletADDRESS...
```

Output from that command will include a transaction ID associated with the `txn` field. Copy this
value (without quotes) which is referred to as `TxnID...` below for use with the CLI wallet.

Stop the gateway service for now:

```bash
kill $gw_pid
# or
killall helium_gateway
```

The gateway service will be started below, after adding the device.

## Join Hotspot Using Wallet

Use the `TxnID...` from the previous step.

Add the hotspot to the network, which requires burning data credits (DC) and must use the CLI
wallet.

Always perform a dry-run (_without_ the commit flag) first:

```bash
cd ~/helium/helium-wallet-rs/
./target/release/helium-wallet hotspots add TxnID...
```

Confirm that the staking fee in DC is `1000000` (six zeros), and then repeat same command plus
`--commit` flag:

```bash
!! --commit
```

## Console

Log on to Console, and [create a new device](/console/adding-devices/).

When successful, Console should indicate "Pending" for this device.

This _pending_ status persists until the next XOR operation by the Router, **which may take 15
minutes** or so.

Both the sniffer and virtual device may be configured during this wait.

Get the following values from Console for your device:

1. Device EUI
2. App EUI
3. App Key

(You may also want the "Device ID" for tracing via SSH session on the router instance itself.)

Each value gets associated with the appropriate key in different configuration files for sniffer and
virtual device.

## Configure Virtual LoRaWAN Device

Using those same values from Console, each value should be associated with the appropriate key
within a **TOML** file: `~/helium/virtual-lorawan-device/settings/settings.toml`

Example:

```toml
[device.one.credentials]
dev_eui = "DevEUIHexValue..."
app_eui = "AppEUIHexValue..."
app_key = "AppKeyLongHexValue..."

[packet_forwarder.default]
host = "localhost:1680"
```

While editing that TOML file, also indicate that it should talk to your instance of `gateway-rs` as
the packet-forwarder (typically on IP Port `1680`).

Keep the `defaults.toml` file unmodified for ease of `git pull` in future.

## Configure LoRaWAN Sniffer

Each value above from Console should be associated with the appropriate key within a **JSON** file:
`~/helium/lorawan-sniffer/lorawan-devices.json`

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "dev_eui": "DevEUIHexValue...",
    "app_eui": "AppEUIHexValue...",
    "app_key": "AppKeyLongHexValue..."
  }
]
```

## Wait For XOR

Again: the Console may indicate "Pending" from having added the new device.

Wait until that message clears before proceeding.

# Live Debugging

There will be _a lot_ of output from each command, so consider using separate Terminal tabs/windows.

## Start Hotspot

Run in its own Terminal window:

```bash
cd ~/helium/gateway-rs/
./target/release/helium_gateway -c config server
```

## Start Sniffer

Run in its own Terminal window:

```bash
cd ~/helium/lorawan-sniffer/
./target/release/lorawan-sniffer sniff --host 127.0.0.1:1680 \
    --log-trace session.csv
```

(The session log may be replayed later with: `./target/release/lorawan-sniffer replay session.csv`)

**Note:** If the gateway restarts, the sniffer may need to be restarted also.

## Start Device

Run in its own Terminal window:

```bash
cd ~/helium/virtual-lorawan-device/
./target/release/virtual-lorawan-device
```

Each start of this program begins with a fresh LoRaWAN Join, so expect to see a matching Join-Accept
response from the router.

Consider making changes to settings within [configuration profiles](/console/profiles/) in Console
for this device, such as `rx_delay`.

## Router Trace

This is optional.

From Console, get the "Device ID" value, which is a UUID string.

Run in its own Terminal window:

```bash
ssh router-dev
```

Start tracing for your device:

```bash
router device trace --id=4e698917-b44c-abcd-b258-afaf579a2099
```

When finished, conclude tracing for your device:

```bash
router device trace --id=4e698917-b44c-abcd-b258-afaf579a2099 --stop
```

Or extract from logs in the usual way:

```bash
grep 4e698917-b44c-abcd-b258-afaf579a2099 /var/data/log/router.log
```
