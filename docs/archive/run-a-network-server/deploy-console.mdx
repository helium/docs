# Deploying Console

<LegacyContentBanner />

Getting [Console](https://github.com/helium/console) deployed is very similar to
[running Console](/network-iot/run-a-network-server/run-console/). Go ahead and follow that guide up
to **Run it!**.

## Encryption

Auth0 requires being run over https. You can get a certificate on your server through
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) by following
[this certbot guide](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions).

"My HTTP website is running 'Web Hosting Product' on 'Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic)'" Was used when
writing this guide. Follow the steps, and note where your certificates are placed, they'll be used
later in nginx.

## Docker

Grab the server docker-compose file

```
cp templates/docker-compose-quay.yaml docker-compose.yaml
```

This docker-compose offers an nginx container to proxy traffic through.

If letsencrypt put your certificate in a place other than `/etc/letsencrypt/`, be sure to update the
`volumes` for the nginx container in `docker-compose.yaml`.

## Nginx

Copy the nxinx config

```
cp templates/nginx-default.conf nginx.conf
```

Edit `nginx.conf` and fill in your certificates name.

## Run It!

`docker-compose up` builds Console and launches it with three other containers: Router, Postgres,
and Nginx. You might see `helium_router` crash a few times as it waits for `helium_console` to start
up and allow the socket connection between the two.

If you go to your host name, you should have an auth0 login available to you. Just as a heads up,
all of your important data is in the `data` in this `console` directory.
