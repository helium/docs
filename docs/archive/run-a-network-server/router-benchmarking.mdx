# Router Benchmarking

<LegacyContentBanner />

This measures load by increasing LoRaWAN traffic in steps on a
[Helium Router](https://github.com/helium/router) to find its threshold of capacity for a given
server instance.

Measuring capacity of a particular server instance may then be compared with another server instance
with different hardware specs. The procedure used is _load & capacity measurement_ but some people
also refer to this as _stress testing_ or _performance testing_.

This document also gives insight to interactions of routers, gateways, organizations, devices and
wallets in production.

For these instructions, each dependency is installed beneath `~/helium/`, and **Bash** shell syntax
on Linux is used below.

**Order of operations is significant.**

Challenges can arise due to the nature of simulation, much like watching the shadows of Plato's
_Allegory of the Cave_ rather than seeing the true cause. Therefore, any defects observed or
suspected should be [flagged](https://github.com/helium/router/issues) by the community-- please!
Then we all benefit from the corrections.

## Dependencies

These **must be isolated** instances dedicated to load & capacity testing, as other users of the
system _will_ be negatively impacted as well as yield meaningless benchmarks:

- [router](https://github.com/helium/router)
  - Must be an isolated instance because **abuse-prevention measures** get triggered
  - Set environment variables: `ROUTER_HOTSPOT_REPUTATION_ENABLED=false` and/or
    `ROUTER_HOTSPOT_REPUTATION_THRESHOLD` to a large integer
  - Set environment variable: `ROUTER_SC_OPEN_DC_AMOUNT=1000000` or higher integer value for budget
    per State Channel
  - By using an ed25519 key for router's wallet, it can be also used for hotspot add and location
    assertion
- [console](https://github.com/helium/console)
  - Set environment variable: `IMPOSE_HARD_CAP=false`
  - Ensure `MAX_DEVICES_IN_ORG` exceeds number of virtual devices

Install wallet on same host as your router if sharing its private key:

- [helium-wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs)
  - Use a wallet with minimal funding **as assurance to avoid overspending**

These may be run locally on your laptop/workstation within their respective build subdirectories:

- [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs)
- [helium-console-cli](https://github.com/helium/helium-console-cli)
- [gwmp-mux](https://github.com/helium/gwmp-mux) LoRaWAN protocol multiplexer
- [virtual-lorawan-device](https://github.com/helium/virtual-lorawan-device)

Additional utilities, possibly already installed on your system:

- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)

## Aliases & Vars

Our working directory is `~/helium/benchmark/`.

```bash
WORKDIR=~/helium/benchmark
```

Convenience aliases:

```bash
alias helium-console-cli="~/helium/helium-console-cli/target/release/helium-console-cli"
alias helium_gateway="~/helium/gateway-rs/target/release/helium_gateway"
alias helium-wallet="~/helium/helium-wallet-rs/target/release/helium-wallet"
alias gwmp-mux="~/helium/gwmp-mux/target/release/gwmp-mux"
alias virtual-lorawan-device="~/helium/virtual-lorawan-device/target/release/virtual-lorawan-device"
```

Define base URLs as shell variables:

```bash
# development versus production, respectively:
API_URL=https://api.helium.wtf
API_URL=https://api.helium.io

# Console corresponding to router-dev:
CONSOLE_URL="https://helium-console-dev.herokuapp.com"

# router-dev:
ROUTER_URL="http://54.176.88.149:8080"
# Optionally defined via script below:
ROUTER_OUI=2
```

Convenience variables: (After a few preliminary runs, significantly increase the following values)

```bash
# number of organizations:
N_ORGS=2

# number of gateways:
N_GATEWAYS=2

# number of devices per org:
N_DEVICES=4

# For priming each loop so subsequent runs can add
# more orgs/devices/gws without clobbering:

FIRST_ORG=1
FIRST_GW=1
FIRST_DEV=1
```

(If going above double digits for gateways or triple digits for devices, the scripts will need to be
revised; see Bash `printf` and `seq --format` expressions below.)

Additional variables will be created along the way.

## Logs & Graphs

Benchmarking load is meaningless without the ability to measure, and in order to optimize server
capacity requires comparing meaningful, consistent measurements.

Graphs described below help on both points.

Subtle nuances to comprehend first:

- _Normal_ has multiple meanings:
  1. colloquially speaking, it's that which is _healthy_
  2. in statistics it's the set of values centered within a particular _distribution_ such as a bell
     curve
- _Nominal_ also has multiple meanings:
  - Within acceptable limits, synonymous with _healthy operation_
  - Say _nominal_ instead of _normal_ in context of Load & Capacity for clarity because inbound
    traffic fluctuates, constantly altering the baseline

The router repo includes the
[Grafana dashboard configuration](https://github.com/helium/router/blob/master/grafana-dashboard.json)
used in production.

For router under significant load, the most critical graphs to watch:

- Ensure **Last Block** nominally remains within single digit minutes
  - Spikes of 10-20 minutes are generally recoverable
  - Sustaining 15 minutes behind should be cause for alarm to take action
- Active **State Channels** on a server routing traffic nominally has **at least 1** and **often
  5-20**
  - A "state channel" facilitates off-block transactions which get persisted to the Blockchain as a
    single transaction
  - The term "state channel" is the generic term for a Layer-2 Ledger (like the "Lightning Network")
    and critical to router's use of the Helium Blockchain
  - An "actor" is a co-routine in Erlang (or "Green Threads", or similar in purpose to "async/await"
    with differing mechanisms)
- **Offer -> Packet -> Downlink** travel times:
  - Ideally would be within **milliseconds** (ms)
  - Acceptable when below **2 seconds**
  - Alarm and take action when above 5 seconds
- **Offer Duration** should be within **milliseconds** (ms)
  - This translates directly to latency of server response
  - Excludes any Internet traffic latency
- Others have values and trends that vary based upon what is being measured and are described
  [below](#comprehending-the-results):
  - **Join Offer Rate**
  - **Packet Offer Rate**
  - **Offer Rejected Reasons**

For designing your own graphs, it helps bucketing by percentiles. Common buckets are: 1%, 5%, 15%,
50%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% 100%, which give the average/mean, an approximation of standard
deviation (15%, 85%) and most importantly the _outliers_. Outliers are skewed here towards the
troublesome high end for fine-grained tracking. The 99th and 100th may be safely ignored when those
values are indistinguishable from latency across the Internet, and such outliers are generally due
to periodic garbage-collection of Erlang's underlying BEAM virtual machine.

Ensure those graphs exist **before** load & capacity tests begin.

## Manual Setup

[Generate a Console API Key](/console/my-account#console-api-keys), which requires logging onto
Console user interface (UI). Everything else will be done by command-line interface (CLI).

Each organization will have its own API Key, which may be obtained via the Console UI under Account
Settings.

Store your new Console API Key generated from the UI to the TOML file below, and specify base URL of
the console. The default of `https://console.helium.com` is probably **not** what you want for
purposes here. This URL must match the Console corresponding to your Router instance.

If using multiple organizations, create individual configuration files within each org's
subdirectory; e.g., `org-01`, `org-02`, respectively.

```bash
for o in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_ORG $N_ORGS); do
  mkdir $WORKDIR/org-$o
done
```

Persist each org's API key and Console base URL in its respective TOML file: (Note the dot preceding
the file name)

```bash
cd $WORKDIR/org-01/

out=.helium-console-config.toml
# Be sure to use *your* assigned key:
echo 'key = "AlphaNumericString..."' > $out
echo 'base_url = "'${CONSOLE_URL}'"' >> $out
echo 'request_timeout = 120'         >> $out
```

**Repeat** for each of the multiple organizations to be used.

Confirm getting valid JSON as a result:

```bash
for o in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_ORG $N_ORGS); do
  cd $WORKDIR/org-$o/
  helium-console-cli device list
done
```

With valid JSON as the result, preliminary installation is complete.

Everything else may be scripted; however, creating your first device via Console UI may be easier
than remembering how to create a unique EUI or app key.

## Create & Fund Wallet

Use or create a new wallet with minimal funding **as assurance to avoid overspending**.

```bash
mkdir $WORKDIR/wallet
cd $WORKDIR/wallet/

helium-wallet create basic

WALLET=$(helium-wallet info | grep Address | awk '{print $4}')
echo $WALLET
```

Ensure enough Data Credits (DC) to cover
[cost of adding data-only hotspots and asserting location](/iot/data-only-hotspots) of each.

> e.g., For 20 instances of gateway-rs: 20 x (1000000 + 500000) at HNT prices in 2022Q2, this will
> require 15 HNT. Plus **add for uplinks** from devices if on a non developer instance of router.

Provide the equivalent of the following command to whomever has the main wallet from which the
limited wallet gets funded:

> Please add funds for Load & Capacity testing: helium-wallet burn --amount 25 --payee $WALLET
> --commit

Again, burning HNT is **only for asserting hotspots** and their locations.

When benchmarking within an isolated environment such as `router-dev`, reset DC balance on the
router host which is described in [Fund Organizations](#fund-organizations) below.

#### Optional: Sharing Keys With Router

_Only applies when router's wallet uses ed25519 keys:_

Since the Load & Capacity activities will likely be using a development instance of a router, you
may use same private key for the wallet: `/var/data/blockchain/swarm_key`

Router can generate a file containing both public and private keys.

Evaluate the following **on router host** via `router remote_console` command:

```Erlang
SwarmKey = filename:join([
    application:get_env(blockchain, base_dir, "data"),
    "blockchain",
    "swarm_key"
  ]),
  {ok, RouterKeys} = libp2p_crypto:load_keys(SwarmKey),
#{public := RouterPubKey, secret := RouterPrivKey} = RouterKeys.

%% View octets of private key as Erlang Binary:
io:format("~P", [libp2p_crypto:keys_to_bin(RouterKeys), 999]).

%% Using any other file path creates INSIDE docker container:
libp2p_crypto:save_keys(RouterKeys, "/var/data/wallet.key").
```

> If output from above indicates that it's an ECC Compact key, that key file is incompatible with
> `helium-wallet` due to using a different elliptic curve.

The private key to be used by `helium-wallet` command will be in `/var/data/wallet.key` file.

```bash
WALLET=$(helium-wallet -f /var/data/wallet.key info | \
         grep Address | \
         awk '{print $4}')
echo $WALLET
```

That shared wallet is ready for use below.

## Router Address

Determine address of the router that you are using by running this one command **on router host**:

```bash
ssh router-dev
cd router/
router peer addr
```

Extract the sequence following `/p2p/` from the output.

That long alphanumeric value gets used in multiple places below as the `$P2P` variable.

Define this on your laptop/workstation:

```bash
P2P=longAlphanumeric...
echo $P2P
```

## Hexagons

Choose a hexagon for each gateway instance.

Because this is a test router yet each gateway's location must be asserted onto mainnet blockchain,
pick a bogus location such as middle of a lake or river. (While there could be legitimate _devices_
in a particular body of water, there is unlikely to be a hotspot there as well.)

> The importance of asserting a location for each hotspot:
>
> Without any location asserted for a particular gateway, the distance calculated to router defaults
> to 1000 as defined within `distance_between()` in
> [router_device_devaddr.erl](https://github.com/helium/router/blob/master/src/device/router_device_devaddr.erl)
> which may be preferable to triangulating based upon physical location.
>
> However, relying upon this default will bypass much program logic which involves a blockchain
> ledger lookup, thereby yielding _artificially_ higher throughput.

A dedicated and isolated router and console pair may disregard concerns about Proof-of-Coverage
(PoC) or an oversaturated Hex.

([Router](https://github.com/helium/router) uses [h3](https://github.com/helium/erlang-h3) hexagonal
hierarchical geospatial indexing system for computing distance, so dig there for any unique criteria
or constraints.

Select latitude and longitude:

```bash
LAT="43.5482302"
LON="-116.6575001"
echo $LAT $LON
```

This pair of latitude and longitude values will be used below.

## Create Devices via Console API

Each device across all organizations must have _unique_ Dev EUI, App EUI and App Key.

For reference, see [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers/) _Link Layer
Specification_ sections as of v1.0.4:

- 6.2.1 End-device identifier (DevEUI)
- 6.2.3 Application key (AppKey)
  - and its footnote which implies the uniqueness constraint

By using **an isolated instance** of router, we may generate identifiers:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR

for org in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_ORG $N_ORGS); do
  for dev in $(seq --format="%03g" $FIRST_DEV $N_DEVICES); do
    (cd org-$org && \
     helium-console-cli device create \
       a0000000000$org$dev \
       600000000000000000000000000$org$dev \
       d0000000000$org$dev \
       benchmark-$dev || echo "org=$org device=$dev" >> errors.log)
  done
done
```

Confirm:

```bash
for o in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_ORG $N_ORGS); do
  cd $WORKDIR/org-$o/
  helium-console-cli device list > devices.json
done
```

Returns JSON, which when formatted via `jq .` resembles the following.

```JSON
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "app_eui": "a000000000001001",
      "app_key": "60000000000000000000000000001001",
      "dev_eui": "d000000000001001",
      "id": "7cbc7f9d-0205-4f85-ab0a-34de8c4d8f52",
      "name": "benchmark-001",
      "organization_id": "57d5b743-fc08-4119-b4ff-0c60ddf976ff",
      "oui": 2
    },
    {
      "app_eui": "a000000000001002",
      "app_key": "60000000000000000000000000001002",
      "dev_eui": "d000000000001002",
      "id": "81d39917-b772-4937-b78b-618f4461340f",
      "name": "benchmark-002",
      "organization_id": "57d5b743-fc08-4119-b4ff-0c60ddf976ff",
      "oui": 2
    },
    {
      "app_eui": "a000000000001003",
      "app_key": "60000000000000000000000000001003",
      "dev_eui": "d000000000001003",
      "id": "cb82bc53-49ec-4401-bed0-2c4010f26c1d",
      "name": "benchmark-003",
      "organization_id": "57d5b743-fc08-4119-b4ff-0c60ddf976ff",
      "oui": 2
    },
    {
      "app_eui": "a000000000001004",
      "app_key": "60000000000000000000000000001004",
      "dev_eui": "d000000000001004",
      "id": "e7cca34d-5234-457f-ae92-8037c2649569",
      "name": "benchmark-004",
      "organization_id": "57d5b743-fc08-4119-b4ff-0c60ddf976ff",
      "oui": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Confirm consistent number of devices generated across organizations:

```bash
wc -l org-*/devices.json
```

The value of `"oui"` in output above should correspond to your value for `$ROUTER_OUI`.

```bash
ROUTER_OUI=$(jq '.devices[0].oui' org-01/devices.json)
echo $ROUTER_OUI
```

## Virtual Devices

This requires devices already having been created via Console API.

The API provides the _single source of truth_ about devices. (Device ID in Console might be
mismatched with respect to identifiers generated below due to sequence of output from API, which is
unimportant for benchmarking.)

Despite lack of plural in the name,
[virtual LoRaWAN device](https://github.com/helium/virtual-lorawan-device) accommodates multiple
devices, as indicated by its README.

Generate a single `settings.toml` file for all devices per organization. (This segments by org for
managing benchmarking runs.)

Connections of devices from same org will distribute across multiple gateways, simulating real world
scenarios with geographically dispersed deployments.

Sending more frequently than 2 seconds per device would be unrealistic. The value for
`secs_between_transmits` may be tuned below, and `rx_delay` which defaults to 1s, may be increased
via Console up to 15s.

```bash
cd $WORKDIR
# Use printf, not `seq --format` to avoid octal when assigning $i below
for o in $(seq $N_ORGS); do
  org=$(printf "%02g" $o)
  [ -d org-$org/settings ] || mkdir -p org-$org/settings
  [ -e org-$org/settings/default.toml ] || \
    ln -s ~/helium/virtual-lorawan-device/settings/default.toml \
      org-$org/settings/

  out="org-$org/settings/settings.toml"
  echo 'default_server = "dev"'                > $out
  # Must be unique across all instances of virtual-lorawan-device:
  metrics_port=$((9898 + o))
  echo 'metrics_server = "127.0.0.1"'          >> $out
  echo 'metrics_port = '$metrics_port          >> $out
  echo ''                                      >> $out

  # Multiplexer sprays across all gateways:
  echo "[packet_forwarder.mux]"                >> $out
  echo 'host = "localhost:1680"'               >> $out
  echo 'mac = "0807060504030200"'              >> $out
  echo ''                                      >> $out

  # Optional, if you want to bypass multiplexer:
  # uncomment this block and use packet_forwarder=gw below.
  #for gw in $(seq $N_GATEWAYS); do
  #  gateway=$(printf "%02g" $gw)
  #  echo "[packet_forwarder.gw${gateway}]"     >> $out
  #  port=$((1680 + gw))
  #  echo 'host = "localhost:'${port}'"'        >> $out
  #  echo 'mac = "08070605040302'${gateway}'"'  >> $out
  #done

  json="org-$org/devices.json"
  for d in $(seq $N_DEVICES); do
    device=$(printf "%03g" $d)
    echo ''                                    >> $out
    echo "[device.${device}]"                  >> $out
    seconds=$((20 + d % 20))
    echo 'secs_between_transmits = '$seconds   >> $out
    frames=$((120 - d % 40))
    echo 'rejoin_frames = '$frames             >> $out

    echo 'packet_forwarder = "mux"'            >> $out
    # Optional round-robin allocation:
    #i=$(( (d % N_GATEWAYS) + FIRST_GW ))
    #gateway=$(printf "%02g" $i)
    #echo '#packet_forwarder = "gw'${gateway}'"' >> $out
    echo "[device.${device}.credentials]"      >> $out
    j=$((d - 1))
    echo 'dev_eui = '$(jq .devices[$j].dev_eui < $json) >> $out
    echo 'app_eui = '$(jq .devices[$j].app_eui < $json) >> $out
    echo 'app_key = '$(jq .devices[$j].app_key < $json) >> $out
  done
done
```

As seconds between transmits increases, number of frames until re-joins decreases for leveling
overall traffic (reducing spikes and eliminating artificial surges).

Some `packet_forwarder` lines are intentionally commented-out above, because there might be
occasions for connecting to a specific gateway directly rather than using the multiplexer.

Sanity check:

```bash
grep -q 'dev_eui = null' org*/settings/settings.toml && \
  echo Something went wrong.
```

Devices may require waiting upwards of 20 minutes (concurrently) for the router's XOR filter to run.
The device will be marked in Console with "Pending" status until then, and there is an API call for
this below.

Later when running the actual test, check logs of `virtual-lorawan-device` for entries containing
the following excerpt:

```log
WARN ... UDP packet received after tx time ...
```

Significantly more than 1:100 ratio indicates the value for `default_secs_between_transmits` should
be increased. That ratio accommodates interference patterns from the scheduler in Linux and the
Tokio async/await framework used within the Rust app, or it can be from the hypervisor when on a
virtualized server instance.

The metrics API will be used below to track successful Joins.

## Configure Gateways

This uses the `$P2P` value defined above in "Router Address" section.

Each gateway must open a listening socket on a unique port number, so this simply increments from
the default base port.

Install configuration files:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR

i=${FIRST_GW:-1}
for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_GW $N_GATEWAYS); do
  mkdir gw-$gw
  ln -s ~/helium/gateway-rs/config/default.toml gw-$gw/

  out=gw-$gw/settings.toml
  keyfile="$(pwd)/gw-$gw/gateway_key.bin"
  echo 'keypair = "'${keyfile}'"'       > $out
  # Must be unique per gw and consistent with device configs:
  port=$((1680 + i))
  echo 'listen = "127.0.0.1:'${port}'"' >> $out
  # Only needs to be unique:
  port=$((4467 + i))
  echo "api = $port"                    >> $out
  echo 'region = "US915"'               >> $out
  echo ''                               >> $out
  echo '[update]'                       >> $out
  echo 'enabled = false'                >> $out
  echo ''                               >> $out
  echo '[router.release]'               >> $out
  echo 'pubkey = "'${P2P}'"'            >> $out
  echo 'uri = "'${ROUTER_URL}'"'        >> $out
  echo 'oui = '${ROUTER_OUI}            >> $out
  echo ''                               >> $out
  # Uncomment for high traffic runs:
  echo '# [log]'                        >> $out
  echo '# level = "warn"'               >> $out
  i=$((i + 1))
done
```

> Note: If using "beta" or other version of [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs)
> instead of "release", change `[router.release]` to match.)

For benchmark runs with very high traffic, uncomment the `[log]` section above, because there's a
measurable cost of I/O due to logging that can negatively impact the host sending packets.

## Add Gateways To Blockchain

Generate transactions using `WALLET` variable defined earlier. Each transaction gets committed
_later_.

When in server-mode for the first time, gateway-rs needs time to generate key material and connect
to upstream services, so start all concurrently:

```bash
for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_GW $N_GATEWAYS); do
  helium_gateway -c gw-$gw server > gw-$gw/server.log &
done
```

Wait until all log files contain at least one entry for `height`, which implies that each has
connected to its upstream validator:

```bash
# Wait:
grep -c height gw-$gw/server.log
```

Generate transactions, which will be signed and committed later:

```bash
for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_GW $N_GATEWAYS); do
  helium_gateway -c gw-$gw info > gw-$gw/gw-info.json

  helium_gateway -c gw-$gw \
    add --mode dataonly \
      --owner $WALLET \
      --payer $WALLET > gw-$gw/add-dataonly.json
done
```

Extract each `txn` value from the previous output and strip quotes from value:

```bash
jq .txn gw-*/add-dataonly.json | \
   sed 's/"//g' > txn-ids.log
```

Prepare command to add each new gateway based upon previous transactions: (if wallet is on router
host, run it there)

```bash
for txn in $(cat txn-ids.log); do
   # Prompts for wallet password
   helium-wallet \
     -f $WORKDIR/wallet/wallet.key \
     hotspots add $txn
done
```

Ensure there were no errors in the preceding output, and repeat same command adding `--commit` flag
to make it reality.

**This burns HNT from your wallet:**

```bash
for txn in $(cat txn-ids.log); do
   # Burn HNT from your wallet:
   helium-wallet \
     -f $WORKDIR/wallet/wallet.key \
     hotspots add $txn \
     --commit
done
```

## Assert Location For Each Gateway

Assert location using `$LAT` and `$LON` defined earlier for each gateway.

```bash
for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_GW $N_GATEWAYS); do
  key=$(jq .key gw-$gw/gw-info.json | sed 's/"//g')

  helium-wallet \
     -f $WORKDIR/wallet/wallet.key \
     hotspots assert --gateway $key \
     --mode dataonly \
     --lat=$LAT$gw --lon=$LON$gw --elevation 6
done
```

Repeat with `--commit` flag, which **burns HNT from your wallet:**

```bash
for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_GW $N_GATEWAYS); do
  key=$(jq .key gw-$gw/gw-info.json | sed 's/"//g')

  helium-wallet \
     -f $WORKDIR/wallet/wallet.key \
     hotspots assert --gateway $key \
     --mode dataonly \
     --lat=$LAT$gw --lon=$LON$gw --elevation 6 \
     --commit
done
```

## Confirm Locations

Allow time-- approximately 5-20 minutes-- for those transactions to be recorded onto the blockchain,
and then confirm asserted locations via blockchain API:

```bash
curl --user-agent "$UA" \
  "$API_URL/v1/hotspots/location/distance?lat=$LAT&lon=$LON&distance=1000"
```

The `distance` parameter above is in meters, so adjust its value if necessary.

Ensure that your gateways appear within those results. If not found, wait several minutes and check
again later.

Other gateways appearing within the results is benign because a virtual LoRaWAN device will only
reach those for which it was explicitly configured since its radio is simulated.

With that, your gateways are ready for Load & Capacity runs.

## Fund Organizations

Benchmarking on an **isolated server instance of router** (e.g., `router-dev`) affords the option of
resetting DC balance of an organization. Otherwise, benchmarking will make a measurable impact to
your wallet; see [Data Credits](/tokens/data-credit) within Console documentation.

First, find your `organization_id` which may be obtained via Console UI. From the Organizations
page, there is an export widget associated with each organization listed.

Alternatively, extract from `devices.json` for each organization. Those files were generated above.

Run:

```bash
jq .devices[0].organization_id org-*/devices.json
```

Use each of those organization IDs and provide the target DC balance, which gets specified as 100k
in this example:

```bash
ssh router-dev
cd router/
router organization update bb5a2fec-1234-5678-89e4-a0e3c4807628 -b 100000
```

Confirm output of the above command, and then repeat with `--commit` flag:

```bash
!! --commit
```

Again, the above command only works on **non-production** environments.

## Wait for XOR Filter

The Console may indicate "Pending" from having added new devices above and may take upwards of 20
minutes.

Wait until that message clears before proceeding.

There is an API call for that status:

```bash
for o in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_ORG $N_ORGS); do
  cd $WORKDIR/org-$o/
  helium-console-cli devices all > status.json
done
```

If any report as `false`, **wait one minute** at minimum before checking again to avoid being
throttled or blocked:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR
jq '.[].in_xor_filter' org-*/status.json \
  | grep false && sleep 60
```

## Start Gateways

Launch each gateway "server" as a separate process, and let the OS handle concurrency:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR

for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $N_GATEWAYS); do
  helium_gateway -c gw-$gw server >> gw-$gw/run.log 2>&1 &
done
```

Allow several minutes for each gateway concurrently connecting to validators and the router
specified in settings.toml file.

**Wait** until each hotspot reports height of the blockchain:

```bash
for gw in $(seq --format="%02g" $FIRST_GW $N_GATEWAYS); do
  helium_gateway -c gw-$gw info > gw-$gw/gw-info.json
done
jq .gateway.height gw-*/gw-info.json || echo "Wait!"
```

Only after each gateway reports a large integer for height, continue.

Due to backoff and retry, each delay takes an increasing amount of time with random variation:

```log
 INFO selecting new gateway in 36s, module: dispatcher
 ...
 INFO selecting new gateway in 69s, module: dispatcher
 ...
 INFO selecting new gateway in 152s, module: dispatcher
 ...

 INFO selecting new gateway in 1826s, module: dispatcher
```

Warnings about deadlines logged between retries can be safely ignored:

```log
 WARN gateway stream setup error: ...
   "error trying to connect: deadline has elapsed" ...
```

> Note:
>
> A gateway may disconnect from its upstream validators or router and automatically reconnect. When
> that occurs, the warnings and retries described above may appear at that time.
>
> One or two retries should be just a blip on the graphs, but extended retries might be cause for
> invalidating the affected run for purposes of benchmarking.

## Start Multiplexers

This sends every Join request and packet to all gateways.

Device configurations performed earlier per organization already account for using the multiplexer.

Run in its own Terminal window: (running in background to be accommodated in a future release)

```bash
port=1681
GW_LIST=''
for gw in $(seq 2 $N_GATEWAYS); do
  port=$((port + 1))
  GW_LIST="${GW_LIST} 127.0.0.1:$port"
done

gwmp-mux --host 1680 --client $GW_LIST > mux.log 2>&1
```

All gateways will receive all Join and Uplink requests.

## Spawn Virtual Devices

Launch fleet of virtual devices as a single OS process:

```bash
cd $WORKDIR

#export RUST_LOG=warn
for o in $(seq --format="%02g" $N_ORGS); do
  virtual-lorawan-device \
    --settings org-$o/settings/ >> org-$o/run.log 2>&1 &

  # Slight mitigation against hammer effect:
  sleep 5
done
```

While waiting for the outer loop to finish, watch your graphs; e.g, Grafana.

Optionally set `RUST_LOG=debug` environment variable for verbose logs.

Note: [virtual-lorawan-device](https://github.com/helium/virtual-lorawan-device) causes the device
to Join (or re-join) upon each start of the utility. (For continuing a previous session,
pull-requests there are welcomed!)

## Watch Devices

The `metrics_port` associated with each running instance of `virtual-lorawan-device` may be queried
via HTTP GET. For bulk requests:

```bash
metrics() {
  time=$(date +%Y-%m-%dt%H:%M:%S)
  for o in $(seq --format="%02g" $N_ORGS); do
    port=$(grep metrics_port $WORKDIR/org-$o/settings/settings.toml | \
           awk '{print $3}')
    curl http://localhost:$port/ > org-$o-stats-$time.txt
  done
}
```

Periodically run:

```bash
metrics
```

Useful statistics to observe while everything is running may be determined by counting the following
log entries for determining success ratios sampled over duration of each benchmarking run.

Logs of virtual-lorawan-device:

- "No Join Accept Received"
- "sending packet"
- "RxWindow expired, expected ACK to confirmed uplink not received"

Logs from gateway-rs for each packet indicate that the packet has been queued but not necessarily
delivered to router.

## Watch A Single Device

This is an optional debugging step.

While the fleet of `virtual-lorawan-device` instances runs, watch a single device.

First, run the loop from [Wait for XOR Filter](#wait-for-xor-filter) above again to re-populate
`status.json` for each organization.

Find devices that indicate a potential problem.

Device IDs that never connected:

```bash
jq '.[]|select(.last_connected|.==null)|.id' org-*/status.json
```

Devices that connected longest ago:

```bash
jq '.|sort_by(.last_connected)|.[0]'  org-*/status.json
```

Device IDs with fewest packets:

```bash
jq '.|sort_by(.total_packets)|.[0].id' org-*/status.json
```

Use those Device IDs for tracing via router CLI:

```bash
ssh router
cd router/
router device trace --id=8db30307-1234-5678-9abc-511376ac301b
```

Each trace expires after 240 minutes.

## Stop

Generally allow this fleet of virtual devices to run for 15-20 minutes, which gives ample traffic
that the Erlang BEAM virtual machine's garbage-collector will have run, etc.

When you have enough data:

```bash
killall virtual-lorawan-device
killall helium_gateway
```

(Those must be names of each actual command-- not Bash aliases.)

Confirm no longer running:

```bash
ps aux | grep virtual-lorawan-device
ps aux | grep helium_gateway
```

## Iterate

To ensure sufficient load, you may need to **run again with increased values** for:

- number of organizations (`N_ORGS`)
- number of devices (`N_DEVICES`)
- number of gateways (`N_GATEWAYS`)

When doing so, also increase corresponding values for `FIRST_*` to be the former value of `N_*` to
avoid clobbering or creating duplicate devices.

Check for new releases of [virtual-lorawan-device](https://github.com/helium/virtual-lorawan-device)
that may facilitate driving higher traffic. Future work will occur there.

## Comprehending The Results

For measuring number of **devices within a devaddr slab**:

Ensure "Join Offer Rate" graph shows step-wise increases, and "Packet Offer Rate" graph resembles a
plateau. Then, watch "Offer Rejected Reasons" graph and stop when seeing an increase in
`devaddr_no_device`.

With disambiguation due in part to the Message Integrity Check (MIC), the usable number will be
higher than apparent capacity; thus, an 8 slab accommodates more than eight devices. Actual limits
may vary with Router and/or Console configurations used.

For measuring **traffic load**:

There should be a slow ramp-up of traffic such that we "find the knee" of the graph _before_ hitting
the plateau (ceiling). Understand this plateau being an approximation due to the nature of generated
traffic.

A good rule-of-thumb:

**Plan for 70% CPU utilization** for nominal load, which provides a cushion for traffic spikes
without being excessively oversized.

## Repeatable Results

When confirming any such measurements:

**Run** the same scenario a **minimum of three consecutive** times with consistent results.

That _excludes_ a preliminary run to invalidate the OS file-system cache.

This rule of three requires consistency. If results vary by more than rounding error, keep running
until getting 3 with similar results.

If the only consistency is that results vary widely, look to other artifacts on the host OS that
might be causing interference. Consider migrating to different host server hardware (via hard
stop/start) if running on a virtualized/hypervisor environment such as AWS, GCP, Linode, etc.

Items that we addressed:

- On Ubuntu Server, prevent Snap from updating during a benchmark run:
  - `sudo snap list` and `sudo apt-get purge snapd`
- If graphs are inconsistent, confirm each gateway is still connected to its upstream Validator:
  - Confirm "Join Offer Rate" graph shows step-wise increases
  - Confirm "Packet Offer Rate" graph resembles a plateau
