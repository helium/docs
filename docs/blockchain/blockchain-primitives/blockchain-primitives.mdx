# Helium Blockchain Primitives

Below are some of the larger components and concepts of the Helium blockchain.

### Blocks

Blocks are used to record the most recent set of transactions in the Helium
blockchain. Blocks are mined based on time, as defined in the `block_time` chain
variable. The current target block time is `60000` milliseconds (or 60 seconds).
During any given epoch, the most recent block consists of:

- Block Version
- Block Height
- Previous Block Hash
- Transactions (stored as a Merkle hash)
- Threshold signature from the current consensus group

The easiest way to see the blocks being mined is with the
[Helium Blockchain Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/). The
[Helium Mobile App](https://helium.com/app) also shows block details. Developers
can also use the Helium blockchain API to access all blockchain transaction and
metadata.

### Epochs

An `epoch` is the target time period for which a given group of Miners is
elected to serve as the consensus group. The target time for an epoch is
currently `30 blocks`, as defined in the `election_interval` chain variable.
Approximately every 30 blocks mined marks the passing of an epoch, after which a
new group of Miners is elected to form the next consensus group. Mining rewards
are distributed per epoch (as opposed to per block in most blockchain-based
systems). At the conclusion of each epoch, the consensus group will distribute
all the $HNT produced in that block via the `rewards` transaction.

### Transactions

The Helium blockchain currently has 20 native transaction types. Some appear in
nearly every block mined while others were created to be used only once and will
never heard from again.

You can see various transaction types in action using the
[Helium Blockchain Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/). At a low level,
transactions are represented as
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), aka
"protobuf". To sign a transaction, other signature fields (if present) are
cleared and the serialized protobuf is signed by the actor.
[The protobuf definitions are available here](https://github.com/helium/proto).

All transactions occur on-chain, and all transactions require Helium Data
Credits to be submitted and confirmed. The following is a list of the supported
transactions:

- `add gateway` - Add a new gateway to the Helium Network. For the purposes of
  transactions, a “gateway” is the term for a Helium-compliant Miner that is
  mining and providing coverage.
- `assert location` - Assert a gateway’s location on the Helium Network. This
  happens after a gateway has been added via the add gateway transaction. Once
  asserted, this location is then used as part of Proof of Coverage challenges.
  A Miner’s location can be asserted more than once but each subsequent
  assertion will a) cost a fee and b) reset that Miner’s score to neutral (.15)
- `chain vars` - Change a chain variable.
- `coinbase` - Similar to the bitcoin blockchain’s coinbase transaction but used
  only during testnet phases of the Helium blockchain. The `rewards` transaction
  has taken its place.
- `coinbase data credits` - Created the initial 10,000 Data Credits required to
  bring the first group of Miners online.
- `consensus group` - Marks the election of a new consensus group, responsible
  for mining during the next epoch.
- `create hashed timelock` - Creates a transaction that can only be redeemed by
  providing the correct pre-image to the hashlock within the specified timelock.
- `create proof of coverage request` - Submitted by a Miner wishing to initiate
  a challenge.
- `data credits` - Burn HNT for DCs at the current oracle price and deliver them
  to the target wallet address.
- `genesis gateway` - Used to define the initial group of Miners that
  bootstrapped the blockchain.
- `multi-payment` - Used to send $HNT from one wallet to multiple wallets.
- `OUI` - Create a OUI for a new router on the Helium network. In the Helium
  blockchain, Miners forward packets to Routers that own them based on their OUI
  as stored in the blockchain.
- `payment` - Used to send $HNT from one wallet to another.
- `proof of coverage receipts` - The result of a POC submitted to the network
  upon completion.
- `redeem hashed timelock` - Redeem the transaction created using the create
  hashed timelock transaction.
- `reward` - A token payout for a specific event on the network such as
  submitting a valid proof of coverage request, participating in a consensus
  group, etc.
- `rewards` - Bundles multiple reward transactions at the end of each epoch and
  distributes all $HNT produced in that block to wallets that have earned them.
- `routing` - Update the routing information associated with an OUI.
- `security coinbase` - Distribution of security tokens in the genesis block.
- `security exchange` - The transfer of security tokens from one address to
  another.
- `state channel open` - Opens a new state channel on a Helium Router
- `state channel close` - Closes a specific state channel on a Helium Router
- `token burn exchange rate` - Change the exchange rate for burning $HNT to DCs.

### Chain Variables

Chain Variables, often referred to as `chain vars`, are a series of
configuration settings for the Helium blockchain. Chain Variables can be used to
change things like target block time, target epoch time, the minimum number of
targets in a POC Challenge, and much more.Chain Variables can be altered by
submitting a transaction containing the chain variable to be changed, its new
value, and a signature of the chain variable master key.

A full list of chain vars and their current values
[can be found here](https://helium.plus/chain-vars).

### Accounts, Wallets, and Keys

The Helium blockchain uses an account-based system for wallets and balances
(similar to Ethereum and others) as opposed to a UTXO-based ledger like Bitcoin
blockchain. Users have several options for creating Helium wallets and managing
their private keys:

- If you’re using the [Helium Mobile Wallet](https://helium.com/app) (iOS,
  Android), your private key is encrypted locally (and can be recreated on
  another mobile device using the 12 word passphrase generated when your wallet
  was first created);
- Using the [Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs),
  users are responsible for creating, storing, and securing a wallet’s private
  key and associated passphrase;

Both the Helium Mobile Wallet and the CLI Wallet create and use keys based on
the [ed25519 public key signature system](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/). The CLI
can also support NIST p-256 keys. And the Helium blockchain supports both key
types.
