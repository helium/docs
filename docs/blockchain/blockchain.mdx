# The Helium Blockchain

The Helium Blockchain is a new blockchain built from the ground up to
incentivize the creation of decentralized, public wireless networks. It's based
on a new, novel work algorithm called Proof of Coverage, and rewards miners in
$HNT, the native token of the Helium blockchain. Officially launched on July 29,
2019, the Helium Blockchain is now running on over 10,000 Helium Miners across
the world; and powers the largest, public, decentralized LoRaWAN Network in the
world.
