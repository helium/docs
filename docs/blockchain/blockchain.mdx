## The Helium blockchain

The Helium blockchain is a new blockchain built from the ground up to incentivize the creation of decentralized, public wireless networks. It's based on a new, novel work algorithm called Proof of Coverage, and rewards miners in $HNT, the native token of the Helium blockchain.  Officially launched on July 29, 2019, the Helium Blockchain is now running on over 10,000 Helium Miners across the world; and powers the largest, public, decentralized LoRaWAN Network in the world.
