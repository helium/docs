# The Helium Consensus Protocol

The Helium blockchain uses a new consensus protocol, called simply the **Helium
Consensus Protocol**.

## Consensus Protocol Design Goals

In designing the protocol, we wanted to emphasize the following characteristics:

- **Permissionless** - Any Hotspot operating in accordance with the consensus
  rules and network specifications should be able to participate freely in the
  Helium Network.
- **Truly decentralized by design** - No incentive should be available for
  taking advantage of factors like inexpensive energy cost or deploying more
  hardware in the same location.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerant** - The protocol should be tolerant of Byzantine
  failures such that consensus can still be reached as long as a threshold of
  participants are acting honestly. For this, we selected a variant known as
  `HoneyBadgerBFT` detailed below.
- **Based on useful work** - Achieving network consensus should be useful and
  reusable to the network. In Nakamoto Consensus-based systems like the bitcoin
  blockchain, work performed to achieve consensus is only valid for a specific
  block. By comparison, Helium’s consensus system should perform work that is
  both useful and reusable to the network beyond simply securing the blockchain.
- **High rate of confirmed transactions** - The protocol should be able to
  achieve a high number of transactions per second, and once the transaction is
  seen by the blockchain it should be assumed confirmed. Users sending device
  data through the Helium Network cannot tolerate long block settlement times
  typical of other blockchains.
- **Censorship-resistant transactions** - Hotspots should not be able to censor or
  otherwise select / deselect transactions to be included in a block.

## HoneyBadger BFT

The Helium Consensus Protocol is based on a variant of the HoneyBadgerBFT
(HBBFT) protocol. HBBFT is based on a body of research originally kicked off by
Andrew Miller and the team at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

HBBFT is an asynchronous atomic broadcast protocol designed to enable a group of
known nodes to achieve consensus over unreliable links. In Helium’s
implementation, a consensus group of [elected Validators](https://explorer-beta.helium.com/validators) receives encrypted
transactions as inputs and proceeds to reach common agreement on the ordering of
these transactions before forming a block and adding it to the blockchain.

HBBFT relies on a scheme known as threshold encryption. Using this scheme,
transactions are encrypted using a shared public key, and are only decryptable
when the elected consensus group works together to decrypt them. The usage of
threshold encryption enables the Helium Consensus Protocol to achieve
censorship-resistant transactions.

## The Consensus Group Election

A new Consensus Group \(CG\) is elected once per epoch. Currently there are `40` members elected to each consensus group, as defined in the `num_consensus_members` chain variable.

## Rewarding Hotspots

At the end of each epoch, mining rewards are distributed by the consensus group to the wallet addresses that have earned them. Currently `65%` of all mining rewards go to the hotspot infrastructure \(with the remaining `35%` being distributed to Helium, Inc and other network investors\). A graphical overview of token reward system can be [viewed here](https://www.helium.com/tokens).

During the course of any epoch, Hotspots are rewarded for the following list of activities:

* Submitting valid proof of coverage challenges \(as a “challenger”\)
* Successful participation in proof of coverage as a target \(as a “challengee”\) 
* Witnessing a proof of coverage challenge
* Transferring device data over the network 
* Serving as consensus group member

The Consensus Group then splits `6%` of all HNT mined, as well as any transaction fees collected during the epoch.

Each one of the above activities is recorded in a block using the `reward` transaction. At the completion of each epoch, all the individual `reward` transactions are grouped in a `rewards` transaction at which point all $HNT mined in that epoch are distributed.
