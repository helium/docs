# The Helium Consensus Protocol

The Helium blockchain uses a new consensus protocol, called simply the **Helium Consensus
Protocol**.

## Consensus Protocol Design Goals

In designing the protocol, we wanted to emphasize the following characteristics:

- **Permissionless** - Any Hotspot operating in accordance with the consensus rules and network
  specifications should be able to participate freely in the Helium Network.
- **Truly decentralized by design** - No incentive should be available for taking advantage of
  factors like inexpensive energy cost or deploying more hardware in the same location.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerant** - The protocol should be tolerant of Byzantine failures such that
  consensus can still be reached as long as a threshold of participants are acting honestly. For
  this, we selected a variant known as `HoneyBadgerBFT` detailed below.
- **Based on useful work** - Achieving network consensus should be useful and reusable to the
  network. In Nakamoto Consensus-based systems like the bitcoin blockchain, work performed to
  achieve consensus is only valid for a specific block. By comparison, Helium’s consensus system
  should perform work that is both useful and reusable to the network beyond simply securing the
  blockchain.
- **High rate of confirmed transactions** - The protocol should be able to achieve a high number of
  transactions per second, and once the transaction is seen by the blockchain it should be assumed
  confirmed. Users sending device data through the Helium Network cannot tolerate long block
  settlement times typical of other blockchains.
- **Censorship-resistant transactions** - Hotspots should not be able to censor or otherwise select
  / deselect transactions to be included in a block.

## HoneyBadger BFT

The Helium Consensus Protocol is based on a variant of the HoneyBadgerBFT (HBBFT) protocol. HBBFT is
based on a body of research originally kicked off by Andrew Miller and the team at the University of
Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

HBBFT is an asynchronous atomic broadcast protocol designed to enable a group of known nodes to
achieve consensus over unreliable links. In Helium’s implementation, a consensus group of
[elected Validators](https://explorer-beta.helium.com/validators) receives encrypted transactions as
inputs and proceeds to reach common agreement on the ordering of these transactions before forming a
block and adding it to the blockchain.

HBBFT relies on a scheme known as threshold encryption. Using this scheme, transactions are
encrypted using a shared public key, and are only decryptable when the elected consensus group works
together to decrypt them. The usage of threshold encryption enables the Helium Consensus Protocol to
achieve censorship-resistant transactions.

## The Consensus Group Election

A new Consensus Group \(CG\) is elected once per epoch. Currently there are `43` members elected to
each consensus group, as defined in the `num_consensus_members` chain variable.

## Rewarding Hotspots

At the end of each epoch, mining rewards are distributed by the consensus group to the wallet
addresses that have earned them. Currently `65%` of all mining rewards go to the hotspot
infrastructure \(with the remaining `35%` being distributed network investors\). A graphical
overview of token reward system can be [viewed here](https://www.helium.com/tokens).

During the course of any epoch, Hotspots are rewarded for the following list of activities:

- Successful participation in proof of coverage as a target \(as a “challengee”\)
- Witnessing a proof of coverage challenge
- Transferring device data over the network

During the course of any epoch, Validators are rewarded for the following list of activities per
changes from [HIP 55](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0055-validator-challenges.md):

- Submitting valid proof of coverage challenges \(as a “challenger”\)
- Serving as consensus group member

The Consensus Group then splits `6%` of all HNT mined, as well as any transaction fees collected
during the epoch.

Each one of the above activities is recorded in a block using the `reward` transaction. At the
completion of each epoch, all the individual `reward` transactions are grouped in a `rewards`
transaction at which point all $HNT mined in that epoch are distributed.
