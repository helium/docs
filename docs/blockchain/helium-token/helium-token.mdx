# The Helium Token

The Helium Token is the native cryptocurrency and protocol token of the Helium
blockchain. Its symbol is `HNT`. Prior to the launch of the Helium blockchain, there was no premine of `HNT`. 
The first `HNT` was produced on July 29th, 2019 [as part of the block 93](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/sEP-cbb2tvSrfbBleT21yGDNM8FIjNr3UT3k3BeZELw). 


:::info
For statistics on HNT, [see the Market section on the Helium Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/market).

## Helium Token Usage

The Helium Token is designed to serve the needs of the two primary parties in
the Helium blockchain ecosystem:

1. **Hotspot Hosts and Network Operators**. Hosts
   [mine HNT](/blockchain/mining) while deploying and maintaining network
   coverage.
2. **Enterprises and developers using the Helium Network** to connect devices
   and build IoT applications. Data Credits, which are a $USD-pegged utility token
   derived from HNT in a burn transaction,
   [are used to pay transaction fees](/blockchain/transaction-fees) for wireless
   data transmissions on the network (in addition to things like adding Hotspots
   and sending).

## HNT Token Economic Concepts

The Helium blockchain uses three distinct token economic concepts to ensure HNT
supply is both plentiful for network needs but also relatively scarce, with a
known maximum. Let's take a look at them in some detail.

### Max Supply

Since the Helium [genesis block](https://explorer.helium.com/blocks/1), the
Network has mined a target of `5,000,000` HNT per month. And since the
[community approval of HIP 20](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/73), the
Helium blockchain uses a two year halving schedule, with a maximum supply of
`223,000,000` HNT.

HNT halving happens every two years from the genesis block, on the following
schedule.

:::info
In the below issuance schedule, year 1 starts on **August 1, 2019**.
Therefore the first halving will happen on approximately day one of the beginning of year three, 
which is **August 1, 2021**.

:::important
While the above schedule states approximately `240,000,000`
HNT will be produced, year one of the blockchain only produced around
`43,000,000` of the target `60,000,000` due to some slow block times. So the
actual maximum supply is `223,000,000` HNT.

### Data Credits and Burn-and-Mint Economics

As noted above, **Data Credits** are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from
HNT in a burn transaction and used to pay
[all transaction fees](/blockchain/transaction-fees) on the Helium Network.
One Data Credit will always cost `$0.00001`. Or, `$1.00` will always buy you
`100,000` Data Credits. But, as noted above, Data Credits are produced by
burning HNT. And the market price of HNT will of course fluctuate.

This HNT to DC relationship is based on a design commonly called a
[burn and mint equilibrium](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/)
and is intended to allow for the supply of HNT to respond to network usage
trends such that, when equilibrium is found, the amount of HNT that exists
remains static month on month. (Helium borrowed heavily from Factomâ€™s usage of
this design though other blockchains have also used it.) The amount of Data
Credits produced by burning HNT will move up and down based on the USD price
of HNT as reported by the [HNT Oracles](/blockchain/oracles). Let's look at
a few examples of how this works on-chain.

**Example 1**

- As always, the price of one DC is `$.00001`
- The current HNT Oracle price is `$1`
- Burning `1` HNT would produce `100,000` DCs

**Example 2**

A Helium Network user requires `50,000` DCs per month to send data for their
fleet of Helium-connected mouse traps. (Yes, these actually exist, and they are 
glorious.) To acquire these 50,000 DCs per month,
they would burn .5 HNT using the following math:

- Again, the price of DC is `$.00001`
- The current HNT Oracle price is `$1`
- Burning `.5` HNT would produce the needed `50,000` DCs

:::important
Once burned, DCs are owned by the Helium wallet specified in the
burn transaction. They are non-transferrable and can only be used by the wallet
owner.

### Net Emissions

:::info
Though Net Emissions was introduced as part of HIP 20, it has not yet been activated on chain.
:::

At this point, the astute reader might be asking themselves the following
question:

> If HNT supply is capped at 223,000,000 AND the Network is constantly burning
> HNT to mint Data Credits to enable transactions, won't we run out of HNT?

**Yes.** This is where the idea of Net Emissions comes in. Along with Max
Supply, [HIP 20](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/73) also introduced the
idea of Net Emissions. Net Emissions give the protocol enough HNT to reward consensus 
group members and Hotspots in perpetuity. 

The [complete Net Emissions discussion in the HIP](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0020-hnt-max-supply.md#net-emissions)
is the best resource on this, but we'll provide a quick summary here:

- Using Net Emissions, the blockchain would monitor how many HNT were
  burnt for Data Credits in a given epoch and add them to the number of HNT to be
  minted that epoch. For example, if 10 HNT were burned for
  Data Credits in an epoch, the system would mint 10 more HNT than were expected in 
  that given epoch. 
- Because HNT produced via Net Emissions do not add to the total outstanding, they
  do not violate max supply. 
- However, Net Emissions would counteract the desired, deflationary effect of Burn and
  Mint. If the system replaces all the HNT that are burned to create Data Credits, there
  is no resulting reduction of supply. 
- Because of this, when implemented, there will be a cap on the number of HNT 
  that can be created via Net Emissions per epoch. When the HNT burned for DCs exceeds 
  this cap, there will be a reduction in supply.
