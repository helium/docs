# Mining and Token Rewards

While there's no exact formula for for calculating how much `HNT` you'll earn
over a given period, there are some higher level concepts, design elements, and
rules to keep in mind that will help better explain what you might earn and why.
This section covers these, as well as some mining and token reward basics.

## How Do Miners Earn Helium Tokens?

The Helium blockchain rewards Miners for providing wireless coverage and
verifying the Helium Network. Hotspots are rewarded in Helium Token, $HNT.

Every epoch, the current consensus group mines approximately 30 blocks on the
blockchain. In each block, Miners perform various types of work and are awarded
according to the following distribution:

| Reward Type           | Description                                                                                                       |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PoC Challenger        | Rewarded to any Miner that creates a valid PoC challenge and submits the corresponding receipt to the blockchain. |
| PoC Challengees       | Awarded to any Miner that completes a stage of a PoC challenge.                                                   |
| Witnesses             | Distributed to all Miners that witness a packet as part of a PoC Challenge.                                       |
| Consensus Group       | Divided equally among the 16 Miners that are part of outgoing Consensus Group, responsible for mining blocks.     |
| Security              | Awarded to Helium, Inc and other Network investors who hold Security Tokens.                                      |
| Network Data Transfer | Distributed each epoch to Miners that route LongFi sensor data for sensors on the Network during that epoch.      |

**_Do I Have To Actively Participate to Earn Rewards Once My Hotspot is
Deployed?_**

No. Once your Miner is completely deployed and fully synced with the Helium
blockchain, you as the owner are not required to do anything else in order to
earn $HNT. Your Hotspot will perform all of the above activities on its own
while it runs.

## Target $HNT Production Per Epoch

The target production rate for new $HNT minted per month is `5,000,000`. This
means that, if the blockchain performs as designed, it will produce `5,000,000`
HNT per month. This target rate is based on the following two parameters, as
defined in their specific chain variables:

- Target **block time** is `60` seconds.
- Target **epoch size** is `30` blocks.

Recall that, in the Helium blockchain, blocks contain some number of individual
transactions and epochs are comprised of all the blocks mined by a the current
Consensus Group since the last epoch.

So, if the Network achieves its target block time of `60` seconds, and target
epoch of `30` blocks, the blockchain will produce 5,000,000 HNT per month. Per
epoch, this equals roughly `3424.66` HNT. The math for this is as follows:

- `(43800 minutes per month / 30 minutes per epoch) = 1460 epochs per month`
- `(5000000 tokens minted per month / 1460 epochs per month) = 3424.65753424658 HNT per epoch`

### What Are The Current Block and Epoch Times?

At any point you can go to the
[Helium blockchain Explorer](http://explorer.helium.com/) to view recent block
and epoch statistics, past $HNT production numbers, and much more. Your
[Helium Mobile Wallet](https://helium.com/app) will also give you the average
block and epoch times for the trailing 24 hour period.

## HNT Distributions Per Epoch

As calculated above, the target `HNT` per epoch is approximately `3424.66`. The
next logical question is, "Where does all this HNT go?" Let's take a look.

Below are the mining rewards per epoch. For every complete epoch, marked by the
election of a new Consensus Group, all the `HNT` produced get distributed over
the following reward types:

| Reward Type           | Percentage    | HNT Earned by Reward Type |
| :-------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------ |
| PoC Challenger        | .95%          | 32.53427                  |
| PoC Challengees       | 18%           | 616.43880                 |
| Witnesses             | 8.55%         | 292.80843                 |
| Consensus Group       | 6%            | 205.4796                  |
| Security Tokens       | 34%           | 1164.3844                 |
| Network Data Transfer | _Up to 32.5%_ | _Up to 1113.0145_         |
| **Total**             | **100%**      | **3424.66**               |

**Rewards Change Over Time**

In the above table you can see the maximum allotted rewards per reward type in
accordance with HIP 10 (described below). If you want to see the current reward
type percentage, you can always query the
[Chain Variables API](https://developer.helium.com/blockchain/api/chain-variables).
The next maximum allotted rewards change is currently scheduled for **August
1, 2021.**

## HIP10 and Variable HNT Rewards for Network Data Transfer

As noted above,
[HIP10 was activated on August 24th, 2020](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0010-usage-based-data-transfer-rewards.md).
HIP10 was introduced by Helium Community Member `hashc0de` and was adopted by
the Helium Community. It ensures that $HNT is rewarded at a rate of 1:1 to the
amount of Data Credits (DCs) routed by any given Miner per epoch. In doing so,
the Network Data Transfer reward is proportional to the DC spent that epoch.
This proportional relationship between Network Data Transfer reward type and DC
is capped at 32.5% (1113.0145 HNT). Therefore, if the DC burned doesn't equal
the value of `1113.0145` HNT the remaining HNT is redistributed to the Proof of
Coverage (PoC) rewards groups pro-rata.

Here are a few examples to illustrate how this works in practice:

**Example 1: DC Burn does not exceed 32.5% HNT**

- In a given epoch, `2,000,000` DCs are transferred across the network
- The HNT Oracle Price is `$2.00`
- In this scenario, total HNT value of DC transferred in this epoch is `10HNT`.
  This calculation is:`(2,000,000 DC * $0.00001 / $2 HNT Oracle Price)`
- These `10 HNT` would be split proportionally to the Miners who did the work
  routing packets at the 1:1 rate.
- The remaining `1103.0145 HNT` from the Network Data Transfer reward would be
  distributed ratably among the Challengers, Witnesses and Challengees.
  - `38.10413727` to the Challenger group
  - `342.9372355` to the Witness group
  - `721.9731273` to the Challengee group

**Example 2: DC Burn exceeds 32.5% HNT**

- In a given epoch, `500,000,000` DCs are spent on data transfer across the
  network
- The HNT Oracle Price is `$2.00`

In this scenario, total HNT value of DC transferred in this epoch is `2500HNT`.
This calculation is:`(500,000,000 DC * $0.00001 / $2 HNT Oracle Price)`

- Because the Network DC burn exceeded the `1113.0145HNT` available to the
  Network Data Transfer reward, all Miners who did the work over this epoch with
  split the full `1113.0145HNT` proportionally.

**Additional Notes on Reward Types and Payouts**

- All Miners in the `Consensus` group will earn an equal reward.
- All Miners participating in PoC, including `Challengers`, `Challengees` and
  `Witnesses` will earn rewards proportional to how many events they
  participated in out of the total number of events per epoch.
- All Miners participating in `Network Data Transfer` will earn rewards
  proportional to their share of the total data transfer in that epoch, as shown
  above.
- Miners can earn one or more reward types during any given epoch.
- Miners are only eligible to submit one Proof of Coverage Challenge - which
  results in them earning the `PoC Challenger` reward - **once per 120 blocks**.
- `PoC Challenger`, `PoC Challengee`, and `Witness` reward types get distributed
  in the epoch that includes the corresponding PoC receipt.
- A Miners can earn more than one `PoC Challengee` and `Witness` rewards per
  epoch.

## HNT Proration and Slow Block Times

The Helium blockchain is still new and growing quickly, so there are bugs to be
squashed and optimizations to be made. Target block and epoch times can be
difficult to attain consistently. To account for this, the Helium blockchain
uses something called `proration` to ensure that the target of `5,000,000` is
achieved even if block and epoch times aren't on target.

**Target HNT Depends on Blocks, Not Clocks**

It's easiest to think of target HNT production over the span of one month. If
the blockchain performs on target, resulting in roughly 1460 epochs per month,
then `5,000,000` new HNT will be produced. "One month" is a period of time
measured by a clock. However, under the hood, we use block time, and the
resulting epochs, to mark HNT production against our target. So when blocks are
slow, HNT production is reduced proportionally.

### What Happens to HNT When Block Times are Slow?

Occasionally, due to the rapid growth of the network, there can be
less-than-optimal block times. This results in slower epochs. When this happens
the blockchain will produce **less** HNT over the same period of time. This may
seem counterintuitive. _Shouldn't the blockchain produce more HNT when block
times are slower to ensure the `5,000,000` per month target is hit?_ No. Again,
think blocks, not clocks. Here's a step-by-step example to make it clearer:

- Let's assume for a given `60` minute period, the average block time was `120`
  seconds (which is double the target of `60` seconds).
- This would mark `30` blocks over the `60` minute period, conclude an epoch,
  and result in HNT rewards being distributed.
- As with any epoch, we would distribute the target of (approximately) `3424.66`
  HNT.
- However, since this epoch took twice as long as normal - `60` minutes versus
  `30` minute target - the blockchain essentially distributes HNT at **half the
  normal rate**.

### When Block Times Slow Down, Everyone Earns Less

The most important take away here is that, when block times slow and HNT
production is reduced, everyone participating in the Network - Witnesses,
Challengers, Helium, Investors, etc. - **is impacted equally** (with the
exception of Consensus Group members; more on this below). So, although it's
annoying that the effective rate of HNT may have dropped over a given period of
time, know that you're not the only one earning less. And this is by design.

### Consensus Groups and Slow Block Times

The only group that doesn't see its HNT reduced per epoch when blocks are slow
is the Consensus Group. Currently there are 16 members of each Consensus Group,
sharing 6% of the HNT produced per epoch - or approximately `12.842475` HNT per
Consensus Group member.

This amount stays fixed while every other category of HNT payout is prorated so
that members of the Consensus Group are incentivized to keep elections fast.
Otherwise, a malicious Consensus Group member might be inclined to prolong
elections. This could be done, for example, to prevent a subsequent election,
thus ensuring current membership in the Consensus Group stays intact. By
distributing a fixed amount of HNT per `30` block epoch (as opposed to prorating
payouts), we remove the incentive to disrupt elections.
