# HNT Price Oracles

HNT coverts to Data Credits at a rate pegged to `$.00001` , and so the
blockchain requires a canonical HNT/$USD price for this conversion. Beginning in
June 2020, the Helium blockchain
[started using a system](https://engineering.helium.com/2020/05/29/HNT-Price-Oracles.html)
of decentralized price oracles to supply the $USD to HNT price used for on-chain
for burn transactions. (This system is inspired by
[the Maker Foundation's Oracle usage.](https://blog.makerdao.com/introducing-oracles-v2-and-defi-feeds/))

To find this price, nine oracles (this number may change in the future)
periodically submit
HNT/$USD prices. Once the blockchain has enough new price data, it will calculate a new HNT/$USD
price that will remain valid until enough new, valid oracle inputs are
submitted, triggering a new price revision.

### Calculating the HNT Price

Every `10` blocks (roughly every 10 minutes) the blockchain will attempt to
establish a new HNT/$USD price. To do this:

1. The blockchain looks for recent price submissions from valid Oracles
   (submitted using a transaction called `price_oracle_submission`). A valid
   price submission is anything that was submitted within the last 25 hours but
   is older than 1 hour. This enables the blockchain to calculate a trailing 24
   hour median while also having a buffer against outlier price inputs in the
   most recent 60 minutes.
2. If there are enough new, valid price submissions in the 24 hour window, a new
   price will be calculated. For this to happen, a majority of the price Oracles
   need to have submitted a price in the window - `((N / 2) +1 )`. So, in our
   system of `9` Oracles, we would need valid prices from at least `5`. (If
   there aren’t `((N / 2) +1 )` new prices, no new HNT price is calculated.)
3. If there are at least `5` new prices, we then proceed to sort-order the list
   low to high, and take the median. So, if we had `7` valid submissions of
   `$.20,` `$.22`, `$.235`, `$.238`, `$.25`, `$.27`, `$.45`, the blockchain
   would select `$.238`, and use this as the external price of HNT for all HNT /
   DC burn transactions until a new price is established \(which could be as
   soon as `10` blocks\).

### Who are the HNT Price Oracles?

The HNT Oracle price feeds are supplied by a group of nine (9) Oracles, composed
of companies, organizations, and individuals. They are:

- Helium, Inc
- Decentralized Wireless Alliance ([DEWI](https://www.dewi.org/))
- Seven (7) Anonymous Individual Community Members

We’ve chosen to keep the names of the individual feed contributors anonymous as
it’s essential to prevent any external attempts at extortion or blackmail. The
names of large companies and organizations that supply feeds, however, are
public and it’s easier for them to combat potential attacks and bad actors.

The current set of public keys for the nine HNT Price Oracles are (in no
particular order):

## Submitting an HNT Oracle Price

An HNT price will only be accepted if the transaction is signed by the private
key associated with one of the known oracle public keys listed above.

### Required Software

Currently Oracles use the
[Helium Wallet CLI](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) for submitting
prices to the blockchain. Download this and get comfortable with it on your
machine if you're not using it already.

#### Submitting HNT Prices

We've added a new transaction to the blockchain for Oracle price submissions -
`price_oracle_submission` added a corresponding CLI command - `oracle report`.

When you download the CLI and run `helium-wallet oracle report --help`, you'll
see something like this:

```text
helium-wallet-oracle-report
Construct an oracle price report and optionally commit it to the Helium Blockchain

USAGE:
    helium-wallet oracle report [FLAGS] --block <block> --price <price>

FLAGS:
        --commit     Commit the oracle price report to the API
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --block <block>    Block height to report the price at. Use "auto" to pick the latest known block height from
                           the API
        --price <price>    The oracle price to report. Specify in USD or supply one of the supported price lookup
                           services ("coingecko", "bilaxy")
```

#### Example Command

Here's a full command to submit a price (with the leading `$` the command line
will supply). **Note the required `--commit` flag. This transaction will fail
without this.**

```text
$ helium-wallet oracle report --price 1.1 --block auto --commit
```

This is telling the blockchain you are reporting a price of `$1.1` and the
current block height and that you're ready to commit it.

Once you hit `Return`, you'll be asked to input your wallet key passphrase.
Supply this, submit it, and you're done.
