# Packet Purchasing

A trustless and decentralized way to allow coverage providers and coverage users
to exchange value is core to the Helium Network. Packet purchasing is implement
on the Helium Blockchain with two specific primitives:

- the Organizationally Unique Identifier
- the State Channel

# Organizationally Unique Identifier

Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs) are registered identities on the Helium Blockchain. To send and receive
packets to an end-device, a network user needs to operate an OUI (or use the [Helium Console](/use-the-network/console)
product, which is a Helium operated OUI).

An OUI has some specificities related to LoRaWAN, [documented here](/lorawan-on-helium#the-oui), but with respect to the
blockchain, that [only addresses registered as endpoints for the OUI](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_oui_v1.proto#L6)
may open and close state channels for an OUI.
