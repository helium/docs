# Packet Purchasing

A trustless and decentralized way to allow coverage providers and coverage users
to exchange value is core to the Helium Network.

Packet purchasing is implemented on the Helium Blockchain with two specific
primitives:

- Organizationally Unique Identifiers
- State Channels

## Organizationally Unique Identifier

Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs) are registered identities on the
Helium Blockchain. To send and receive packets to an end-device, a network user
needs to be serviced an OUI. This can be their own OUI or one operated by a
third party, such as [Console](/use-the-network/console) operated by Helium,
Inc.

An OUI has some specificities related to LoRaWAN and packet routing,
[documented here](/lorawan-on-helium#the-oui), but with respect to the
blockchain, what's important is that
[only libp2p addresses registered as endpoints for the OUI](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_oui_v1.proto#L6)
may open and close state channels on behalf of an OUI.

For example,
[this account](https://explorer.helium.com/accounts/13tyMLKRFYURNBQqLSqNJg9k41maP1A7Bh8QYxR13oWv7EnFooc)
[purchased the first OUI](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/6ACW9A5Hj3KDnOJELWAvAVG3yM71OpNAYpdAPM3ti1A)
on the Helium Blockchain. The address
`112qB3YaH5bZkCnKA5uRH7tBtGNv2Y5B4smv1jsmvGUzgKT71QpE` operates the OUI on
behalf of the owner. You can monitor its activity
[here](https://explorer.helium.com/accounts/14oSuAgRmAFPFPZRY1MUwir5AJSLGkaXHzuSZJ92BuYCfLMN1Et).

OUIs are purchased (see current
[fee schedule](/blockchain/transaction-fees#transaction-fee-schedule)) and
numbered in incrementing order. You can query the API for a list of existing
OUIs using [the following endpoint](/api/blockchain/ouis#list-ouis).

## State Channels

State channels are side-chains opened by OUI operators (any of the libp2p
addresses registered to the OUI). With an
[`state_channel_open`](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_state_channel_open_v1.proto)
transaction, the operator stakes two times the amount of Data Credits (DC)
available to be spent in the channel. In addition, the amount of blocks until
channel expiration is configured.

Once a state channel is opened, hotspots and OUIs operators are able to transact
within the channel. Generally, the flow is as follows:

- a packet is offered by a hotspot to the OUI operator, with some metadata but
  without the actual payload
- the OUI operator decides whether to purchase the packet; if it decides to
  purchase, the offer is signed
- the packet is delivered by the hotspot to the OUI operator

These signed offers are added to the state channel "banner", which allows the
device to confirm that it is being given credit for its work during the lifetime
of the state channel. This is possible even as many other hotspots have their
own transactions added to the same banner.

Sometime before the expiration block, the OUI operator will submit a
[`state_channel_close`](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_state_channel_close_v1.proto)
transaction channel, a transaction which also explicits how many data credits
are being burned in the name of which hotspots. Should a hotspot not be credited
the appropriate amount, it has recourse during a "grace period" the ten blocks
after the closure to file a dispute, using the signed offers as evidence. This
is done in the form of alternate state channel close transactions.

If there is no overspend or disputes, the second half of the stake and any
remaining credit is returned to the OUI operator. Otherwise, the entire stake is
kept and, in the event of a dispute, the appropriate amount of data credit burns
are attributed to the hotspots with valid disputes.

Should the operator neglect to close the state channel before the expiration
block, closes by all parties are still accepted during the ten block grace
period. Should the OUI operator still neglect to close the channel, they will
lose their whole stake.
