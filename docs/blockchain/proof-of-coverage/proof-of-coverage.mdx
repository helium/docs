# Helium Proof of Coverage


The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof-of-Coverage” (PoC) to verify that Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis, that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are creating from that location.

**See Proof of Coverage in Action**

The Helium Network Explorer is the best resources for viewing POC-related data. Before you dive into the POC internals, here are a few POC Challenges to help you visualize how this works:

## Why Proof of Coverage?

The Helium Network is a [physical wireless network](https://explorer.helium.com) that succeeds based on the amount of reliable coverage it can create for users deploying connected devices on it. As such, it required a work algorithm that was built for this use case. Proof-of-Coverage takes advantage of the unique, undeniable properties of radio frequency (RF) to produce proofs that are meaningful to the Helium Network and its participants. Specifically, PoCn relies on the following characteristics:

* RF has limited physical propagation and, therefore, distance; 
* The strength of a received RF signal is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the transmitter; and
* RF travels at the speed of light with (effectively) no latency;


Using these properties, the blockchain is constantly interrogating Hotspots using a mechanism known as a “PoC Challenge”. The ultimate power of Proof-of-Coverage lies in the fact that the data generated by the ongoing proofs and stored in the Helium blockchain is definitive verification of the wireless coverage provided by Hotspots on the Network. 


## Proof of Coverage Challenges

### Beacons

When a Hotspot first joins the Network, it is not known to its neighbors and therefore won't appear in any witness lists. And withtout being in any witness lists, it will not be included in any POC Challenges.

### Witnesses

### Challengers

### Challengees



## POCv10 Pass / Fail Parameters  

Proof of Coverage is constantly being modified and updated by the community of Helium developers to adapt to the changing needs of the Network. The latest version of Proof of Coverage to be deployed is POCv10. As if POCv10, the Network is using the following parameters to verify a valid witnesses and challengees. 






## POC-related HIPs

The HIP system (Helium Improvement Proposals) is the primary mechanism for how POC gets modified and updated over time. The following is a list of HIPs related to POC that have been approved by the community and implemented.
