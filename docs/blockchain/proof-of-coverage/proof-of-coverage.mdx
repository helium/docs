The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called “Proof-of-Coverage”
(PoC) to verify that Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC
tries to verify, on an ongoing basis, that Hotspots are honestly representing
their location and the wireless network coverage they are creating from that
location.

The Helium Network Explorer is the best resources for viewing POC-related data.
Before you dive into the POC internals, here are a few POC Challenges to help
you visualize how this works:

## Why Proof of Coverage?

The Helium Network is a [physical wireless network](https://explorer.helium.com)
that succeeds based on the amount of reliable coverage it can create for users
deploying connected devices on it. As such, it required a work algorithm that
was built for this use case. Proof-of-Coverage takes advantage of the unique,
undeniable properties of radio frequency (RF) to produce proofs that are
meaningful to the Helium Network and its participants. Specifically, PoCn relies
on the following characteristics:

- RF has limited physical propagation and, therefore, distance;
- The strength of a received RF signal is inversely proportional to the square
  of the distance from the transmitter; and
- RF travels at the speed of light with (effectively) no latency;

Using these properties, the blockchain is constantly interrogating Hotspots
using a mechanism known as a “PoC Challenge”. The ultimate power of
Proof-of-Coverage lies in the fact that the data generated by the ongoing proofs
and stored in the Helium blockchain is definitive verification of the wireless
coverage provided by Hotspots on the Network.

## Proof of Coverage Challenges

### Beacons

When a Hotspot first joins the Network, it is not known to its neighbors and
therefore won't appear in any witness lists. And withtout being in any witness
lists, it will not be included in any POC Challenges.

### Witnesses

### Challengers

## POC Chain Variables

Much of Proof of Coverage is controlled by blockchain chain variables. 


## POCv10 Pass / Fail Parameters

Proof of Coverage is constantly being modified and updated by the community of
Helium developers to adapt to the changing needs of the Network. The latest
version of Proof of Coverage to be deployed is POCv10. As if POCv10, the Network
is using the following parameters to verify a valid witnesses and challengees.

## POC-related HIPs

The HIP system (Helium Improvement Proposals) is the primary mechanism for how
POC gets modified and updated over time. The following is a list of HIPs related
to POC that have been approved by the community and implemented.

| HIP Number | Description         | Date Approved | Date Deployed  |
| :--------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :------------- |
| 01         | Here's a cool thing | Number        | Another Number |
| 02         | Here's a cool thing | Number        | Another Number |
