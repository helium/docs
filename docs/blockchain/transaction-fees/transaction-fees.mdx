# Transaction Fees

Like most blockchains, Helium has a system of transaction fees. All transactions
in the Helium blockchain are paid in Data Credits (DCs). Data Credits are
produced via burning some amount of `HNT` using an on-chain transaction. And
thanks to a system called "Implicit Burn", users (typically) don't need to
manually supply `DCs` to pay fees. As long as the Helium wallet being used to
submit the transaction contains enough `HNT` to burn to `DCs` to fund the
transaction, the burn will happen implicitly, requiring no user intervention.

### Transaction Fee Schedule

The following is a list of the current set of fees required for various
transactions, along with their details. Transaction fees are paid in Data
Credits. (Note that the cost is not shown in `HNT` as this number is variable
based on the current $USD/HNT price as defined by the HNT Price Oracle.)

| Fee Type                        | Fee Description                                                                                                              | **Cost (DC)** | Cost ($USD) |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| Send HNT                        | Transferring HNT from wallet to wallet                                                                                       | `Variable`    | `Variable`  |
| Transferring Device Packet Data | Fee paid by device owner when sending or receiving sensor data. Metered per 24 bytes.                                        | `1`           | `$.00001`   |
| Add Miner                       | Fee paid to add Miner to the blockchain. (**Only applies to non-Helium Hotspots.)**                                          | `4000000`     | `$40`       |
| Assert Miner Location           | Required when asserting a Gateway's location. \(The **first two assertions** for Helium Hotspots are paid by Helium, Inc. \) | `1000000`     | `$10`       |
| Purchasing a blockchain OUI     | Buy an OUI from the Helium blockchain                                                                                        | `10000000`    | `$100`      |
| Purchasing a blockchain Subnet  | Buy a Subnet from the Helium blockchain                                                                                      | `10000000`    | `$100`      |

### Calculating the DC cost for Sending HNT

As noted above, the `DC` cost of a `Send` transaction is variable. The precise
cost is based on the size of the transaction, in bytes. Once the size is
calculated, we apply a `5000x` multiplier. For a typical send transaction, where
one wallet is sending to one wallet
([like this one here](https://explorer.helium.com/txns/RP8xdjuYsvIAaEuyNvMmlBF7Kc8ShNoURtA1ccgMGpk)),
the complete transaction is made up of the following:

| Transaction Component | Component Size (Bytes)           |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Payer Wallet Key      | 33                               |
| Payee Wallet Key      | 33                               |
| Payer Signature       | 64                               |
| Nonce                 | 3 (approximate; ranges from 2-4) |
| Payment Amount        | 6 (approximate; ranges from 4-8) |

- In total, this is `139` bytes.
- Each `24` bytes requires one Data Credit (as is the case when you're
  transferring device packet data).
- `139` / `24` results in `6` Data Credits.
- We then apply our 5000x multiplier, and the result is a transaction fee
- This results in a `30000 Data Credit` cost for the above transaction.

### Transaction Fees and Implicit Burn

The Helium blockchain uses something called `implicit burn` when paying fees.

**Implicit Burn™**

The term `implicit burn` was coined by Helium PM Coco "cokes" Tang, a recognized
innovator in the blockchain technology and terminology space.

Thanks to Implicit Burn™, if you have enough HNT in your wallet to pay the
transaction fee, the Helium Mobile Wallet (or the Helium Wallet CLI) will
calculate the DC cost of your transaction and the blockchain will automatically
burn the precise amount of HNT to supply the required DCs for the transaction.
For example:

- You need to send `10 HNT` from a Helium Wallet that contains `11 HNT`
- The cost for this `send` transaction is `35000 DCs`
- Let's assume the `HNT/$USD` Oracle Price is `$.35` at the time you send the
  `HNT`. This means that you'll need to supply a `1HNT` to fund the `35000 DCs`
  for this transaction.
- When you send the `10 HNT`, the Helium Wallet automatically supplies the
  `1 HNT` to be burned into `DCs`.
- After the transaction is submitted and processed, your resulting Helium Wallet
  balance will be `0 HNT`.

In the above example, had you attempted to send `10.0001HNT` with only. `11 HNT`
in your wallet, this transaction would have failed as burning `.999 HNT` would
only result in `34965 DCs`, a mere 35 DCs short of the `35000` required for a
`send` transaction.

### Failed Transactions Result in No DCs Being Spent

Transactions in the Helium blockchain are `atomic`. In short, this means that
they either succeed entirely or they don't. So, if you attempt to send HNT from
a Helium Wallet without enough HNT to supply the required Data Credits, the
transaction will fail after being submitted to the blockchain API by your
wallet. And your `HNT` balance will be the same. No `DCs` were burned (or
harmed) in this failed transaction.
