### How a HIP Becomes a Vote

A vote can be created by opening a PR against the
[Helium Vote repository](https://github.com/helium/helium-vote/). Templates are provided within the
repo. Authors are encouraged to write their HIP description in a nonbiased manner, and are subject
to review. In partnership with the Helium Foundation, a block height deadline, vote ID, and voting
addresses will be provided.
