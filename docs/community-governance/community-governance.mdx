## Discord

Network Community. Here you'll find real-time, in-depth discussion on all parts of the Helium
Network. It is also the primary venue to get support for using the Network.

## Helium Improvement Proposals

The Helium Community uses a governance mechanism called **Helium Improvement Proposals** (known as
"HIPs"). Modeled on BIPs from the Bitcoin community, HIPs are used to introduce, debate, and
approve/reject new changes to major elements of the network like the core protocol, token economics,
and even network governance itself.

In the earliest phases it's best to vet an idea with the Helium community
[via Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). This is a good way to see if there is initial support for
the idea, or if it's been discussed before. The #hip-discussion channel is a great place to
circulate an early idea.

HIPs are managed entirely from the [HIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/helium/HIP). Specific
HIP discussion also happens in the `Improvement Proposal` channels of
[Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). Any and all members of the Helium Community are
encouraged to create HIPs, and participate in the governance process.
