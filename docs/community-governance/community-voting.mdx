In order to approve or deny changes to the protocol, economics, or governance of the Helium Network;
The Helium Network leverages on-chain voting which is open to the entire community. This on-chain
voting is currently facilitated through a Realms organization.

## Key Terms

- **Vote Escrowed (ve):** A position created by staking your tokens which enables DAO or subDAO
  voting.
- **Voting Power:** Vote Escrowed grant their holder voting power. One veToken is equivalent to one
  vote on matters of community governance.
- **Realms:** A Solana-native tool for staking, delegation, DAO, and treasury management.
- **veHNT:** A position created by staking your HNT.
- **veIOT:** A position created by staking your IOT. Used for IOT Network governance.
- **veMOBILE:** A position created by staking your MOBILE. Used for MOBILE Network governance.

## veTokens and Voting

Token holders can vote by 'staking' their tokens to the protocol that they are voting for. This
mechanism helps to ensure that the voter holds a long-term interest in the success of the Helium
Network. veTokens come in several forms with specific responsibilities to segments of the network.

Each subDAO governs a specific area of the network. Initially, two subDAOs are introduced: IOT and
MOBILE. Voting on the IOT and MOBILE networks will require veIOT and veMOBILE respectively.

### veHNT

The [Helium DAO](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt) and the Helium Network serve as the
overarching system that enables a multitude of networks (subDAOs) to exist. As such, veHNT's role in
network governance is in matters affecting the entire network. For example, a proposal affecting HNT
emissions would be voted on using veHNT.

Additionally, veHNT can be [delegated](/vote-escrow/realms#delegating-stakes) to a subDAO in order
to earn a portion of that network's tokens.

### veIOT

The [IOT subDAO](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot) focuses on the original vision of the Helium
Network, supporting the growth and development of IoT devices and applications. Staking your IOT
tokens to the IOT subDAO grants veIOT which can be used to vote on matters specific to the IOT
network. For example, a proposal affecting proof of coverage behavior for IoT Hotspots.

### veMOBILE

The [MOBILE subDAO](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile) is dedicated to the growth and
expansion of the Helium Network in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Staking your IOT
tokens to the IOT subDAO grants veIOT which can be used to vote on matters specific to the IOT
network. For example, a proposal affecting proof of coverage behavior for IoT Hotspots.

:::note How to stake tokens

For a full walkthrough on how to stake your tokens to the Helium Network or one of its subDAOs, see
the [Realms Staking](/vote-escrow/voting-power) guide.

## Voting with Realms

Like many other Solana Ecosystem projects, Helium uses Realms to organize and manage governance,
vote escrowed tokens, delegation, and more. Using the links above, you can cast your vote for the
relevant segment of the Helium Network.

### Signing Into Realms

Use your account that holds your veHNT positions to sign in to Realms. The same account can be used
for all platforms, but it must have veTokens for the specific DAO or subDAO hosting the vote.

The links for the Realms governance portals are:

- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt)
- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot)
- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile)

Sign in to these using the in-app browser from the Helium Wallet App.

### Casting Your Vote

After you have reviewed the proposal, casting your vote is as easy as issuing a Solana transaction
for "Yes" or "No".

Note: You will need a bit of Sol to cast your veTokens for a vote.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/castvote.png')}

    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>After voting, you can leave a comment supporting your stance.</figcaption>

### Understanding Vote Power

When you vote your veTokens, all positions will be attributed to your vote choice. Token positions
cannot be split within one vote on a single account.

Your vote is calculated at the time your vote is submitted. If your position is in 'decay' mode,
voting sooner means you apply greater voting power. Conversely, if a position is extended to added
to, a vote can be relinquished and re-voted to apply the new voting power.

## Staying Informed

The majority of HIP discussion happens on the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). Many HIPs
get their start in the #hip-discussion channel. Additionally, each HIP under consideration gets its
own channel for focused discussion.

When HIPs are open for vote, notifications are sent by the Helium Foundation on Discord, Twitter,
and push notifications in the Helium Wallet App.
