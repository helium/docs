# FAQ - Build On Network

## I want to use the Helium Network for my IoT project. How do I learn more?

Thanks for your interest! Join the [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/helium) as there
are several channels dedicated to development. Thereâ€™s also
[extensive documentation on using the Network](/use-the-network).

## Can end devices communicate directly with each other or do they have to hop over the Helium Hotspot?

All compatible devices communicate via Hotspots. There is no direct communication or meshing in the
Helium Network.

<!-- TODO: hotspot to hotspot communication is wallet to wallet -->

## Will Helium be proprietary?

We believe proprietary protocols and technologies stifle innovation. This is why we use commodity,
open-standard hardware, and modules available from dozens of vendors. And all software used is
[open source under friendly licenses](/faq/open-source).

## What kind of data rates do you anticipate going from device to the Hotspot?

Applications that are suitable for the Helium Network send small amounts of data. The maximum amount
possible is around 5kbits per second. But this is rarely seen in production. Typically sensors are
sending 10-1000 bytes at a time.
