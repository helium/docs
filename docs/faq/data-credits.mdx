# FAQ - Data Credits

### What are Data Credits? Do I need them?

If youâ€™re a Hotspot owner, you do not need to worry about holding individual 
[Data Credits](/blockchain/helium-token/#data-credits-and-burn-and-mint-economics).

Data Credits for hotspot owners are created on-demand through implicit burn and 
[used to pay all hotspot transaction fees](/blockchain/transaction-fees/#transaction-fees) such as adding
Hotspots, sending HNT, and asserting location. These data credits are burned automatically through
the app from the available HNT in your wallet and can also be burned via the CLI.

For sensor users/developers who wish to transmit data (LoRaWAN/LongFi/etc) via the Helium Network your transactions will require the use of discrete Data Credits held in a Helium Console account.  

One Data Credit pays for 24 bytes of LoRaWAN payload. Any number that exceeds 24 bytes is rounded
up, so a packet with a 25-byte payload would cost the same as one with 47 bytes - two Data Credits.

Although Data Credits are produced by burning HNT, the price of Data Credits is fixed in USD. Data
Credits are non-transferrable, and can only be used by their original owner. Data Credits cannot be
re-sold or traded. Data Credits are similar to pre-paid cellphone minutes or airline miles.
