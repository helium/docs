While HIPs are in discussion, the actual text is included in the
[Helium HIP Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/helium/hip).

Before a HIP goes to a vote, it is likely that changes and revisions will need to be made to an
existing proposal.

:::tip Key Take Aways

This page will walk users through the process of:

- Creating a personal copy, or "fork", of the Helium HIP repository.
- Making edits using the in-browser text editor.
- Submitting these changes for review.

## Fork the Repo

:::info What the Fork

Rather than making edits to the main repository, create a personal copy by "forking" the repository
to your GitHub account.

:::

1. Log in to an existing account or create a new account on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Open the Helium HIP Repository at [https://github.com/helium/hip](https://github.com/helium/hip)
3. Click the `Fork` button in the upper right-hand corner.
4. Leave all settings default and confirm using the green `Create Fork` button at the bottom
   left-hand corner.
   - A copy of the Helium HIP repository will be made in the user's GitHub account and should open
     automatically.

2. Open the HIP to edit, this example uses HIP 83, by clicking on the file.
3. Click the `Pencil Icon` in the upper right-hand corner to make edits.
4. Make edits or changes to the HIP.
5. Click the green `Commit changes...` button in the upper right-hand corner.

:::info HIPs are Written in Markdown

All HIPs in the Helium GitHub repository are written in **Markdown** an easy-to-read, easy-to-write
syntax for formatting plain text.

You can read more about basic writing and formatting syntax
[here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Make a Pull Request

:::info What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request, or "PR", is quite literally an ask to the repository maintainers to "pull in"
proposed changes.

:::

1. Committed edits will display a "This branch is 1 comit ahead of helium:main" banner at the top of
   the `Code` tab in the forked repository.
   - the number may be more than 1, depending on how many edits ahead the forked repository from the
     main HIP repository.
2. Click the grey `Contribute` dropdown.
3. Click the green `Open pull request` button.
4. Edit the `Title` and `Description` to inform other readers and maintainers what changes were
   made. Good pull requests are detailed in their explanation of changes.
5. Click the green `Create pull request` button.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">

    style={{ maxHeight: 400, borderRadius: '40px', padding: '14px 16px 20px' }}
  />

All PRs are reviewed by the HIP authors, and once approved are "merged" into the main branch by
repository maintainers where the edits are visible to the Helium community.

## Stay involved.

Once a PR is submitted, authors are asked to keep a watch on them for comments or change requests.
By default, the user to submit a PR will be subscribed via email to receive notifications on PR
activity.

Timely responses in GitHub keep the process moving!
