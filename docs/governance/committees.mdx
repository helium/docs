Committees are a necessary part of performing key operations, regulating standards, and coming to a
consensus on changes to the Network.

Committees are often established through HIPs or out of rough consensus from a common sense need.

Today, the Helium Community utilizes one Committee, the Manufacturing Compliance Committee.

## Manufacturing Compliance Committee (MCC)

**Origin:** The MCC was established by
[HIP 19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md).

**Purpose:** The MCC sets basic technical, security, and ethical standards & verifies that these
standards are met by manufacturers joining the Helium Network through the HIP19 process.

You can find more information about the MCC, Ethics for Makers/Manufacturers, and more
[here](/hotspot-makers/compliance-committee).
