Committees are a necessary part of performing key operations, regulating standards, and coming to a
consensus on changes to the Helium Network.

Committees are often established through [Helium Improvement Proposals][hip] ("HIPs") or out of
rough consensus from a common sense need.

## Manufacturing Compliance Committee

Today, the Helium Community utilizes one Committee, the Manufacturing Compliance Committee ("MCC").

The MCC was established by [HIP-19][hip-19] with the purpose to set basic technical, security, and
ethical standards & verifies those standards are met by Hotspot Makers joining the Helium Network
through the [HIP-19][hip-19] process.

You can find more information about the MCC, Ethics for Makers/Manufacturers, and more [here][mcc].
