The Helium Community is the home to hundreds of developers and network operators who collaborate
across the world every day to build the global decentralized wireless network that is Helium.

The Helium Community utilizes network-wide, token voting for Governance. The Helium Improvement
Proposal, or "HIP", is the core unit of change.

Anyone is welcome and encouraged to write a HIP. HIP Editors are Foundation Employees or Community
Volunteers who assist authors with HIP readiness.

All token holders are eligible to vote! To participate in making changes to the Helium Network,
token holders should stake their tokens in Realms.

All are welcome to shape the future of decentralized wireless.

Read on for more information and join us!

## Propose

### Helium Improvement Proposals

The Helium Community uses a governance mechanism called **Helium Improvement Proposals** (known as
"HIPs"). Modeled on BIPs from the Bitcoin community, as well as pulling from influences of
open-source development, HIPs are used to introduce, debate, and approve/reject new changes to major
elements of the Network like the core blockchain, HNT, IOT MOBILE token economics, and Network
governance itself.

In the earliest phases, it's best to vet an idea with the Helium community [via Discord][discord].
This is a good way to see if there is initial support for the idea, or if it's been discussed
before. The [hip-discussion][discord-hip] channel is a great place to circulate an early idea.

HIPs are managed entirely from the [HIP GitHub repository][github-hip]. HIP discussions also happen
in the `Helium Improvement Proposal` channels of [Helium Discord][discord]. All members of the
Helium Community are encouraged to create HIPs and participate in the governance process.

## Vote

### Realms

[Realms][realms] is a Solana native tool for DAO infrastructure. As part of the migration to the
Solana Blockchain, the Helium Community adopted Realms as the tool for staking, delegating, and
on-chain voting. This tool replaces Helium Vote.

Read [this page][realms-tutorial] to learn how to navigate Realms.

## Be In The Know

### Monthly Community Calls

The Helium Community holds monthly video calls (led by the [Helium Foundation][foundation]). These
typically happen on the the **4th Wednesday of each month at Noon ET**. Each call has an open
agenda, and any community member can join and add items to the agenda to be discussed.

- [Community Call Notes and Agenda][community-call-notes]
- [Video recordings of previous community calls][community-call-video] are linked in the Community
  Call notes.

### Discord

All HIP and Governance discussions take place on the [Helium Discord](discord).

### Socials + Ecosystem Voices

As a network steward, the Helium Foundation posts important governance news, calls to vote, and more
on Twitter. [Follow @HeliumFndn][foundation-twitter] on Twitter to stay up to date.

As a decentralized network, there are numerous voices that discuss governance, host debates, and
explain HIPs in layman's terms. You can find many of these influential voices in Discord, on
Twitter, or Youtube.
