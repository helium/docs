The Helium Community is home to hundreds of developers and network operators collaborating to build
global decentralized wireless networks.

> The Helium Improvement Proposal ("HIP") is the core unit of change.

---

## Propose

Anyone is welcome and encouraged to write a HIP and shape the future of decentralized wireless.

### Helium Improvement Proposals

The Helium Community uses a governance mechanism called Helium Improvement Proposal, known as a
"HIP," modeled on ["BIP"s][bip] from the Bitcoin community and influenced by open-source development
practices.

The HIP process introduces, debates, and approves/rejects new changes to core fundamentals of the
Network, for example, the core blockchain, HNT, IOT, or MOBILE token economics, and Network
governance itself.

Learn more about HIPs [here][hip-docs].

---

## Vote

The Helium Community utilizes network-wide token voting for governance.

All token holders are eligible to vote! To participate in making changes to the Helium Network,
token holders should stake their tokens in [Realms][realms].

### Realms

[Realms][realms] is a Solana native tool for DAO infrastructure. As part of the migration to the
Solana Blockchain, the Helium Community adopted Realms as the tool for staking, delegating, and
on-chain voting. This tool replaces Helium Vote.

Read [this page][realms-tutorial] to learn how to navigate Realms.

Join the DAOs on Realms.

## Be In The Know

### Community Calls

The Helium Community holds monthly video calls (led by the [Helium Foundation][foundation]). These
typically happen on the **4th Wednesday of each month at Noon ET**. Each call has an open agenda,
and any community member can join and add items to the agenda to be discussed.

- [Community Call Notes and Agenda][community-call-notes]
- [Video recordings of previous community calls][community-call-video] are linked in the Community
  Call notes.

### Discord

The [Helium Discord][discord] is the primary communication channel for the Helium Community. Here
you'll find real-time, in-depth discussion on all parts of the Helium Network. It is also the
primary venue to get support for using the Network.

All HIP and Governance discussions take place on the [Helium Discord][discord].

### Socials + Ecosystem Voices

As a network steward, the Helium Foundation posts important governance news, calls to vote, and more
on Twitter. [Follow @HeliumFndn][foundation-twitter] on Twitter to stay up to date.

As a decentralized network, numerous voices discuss governance, host debates, and explain HIPs in
layman's terms. You can find many of these influential voices in Discord, on Twitter, or on YouTube.

If you'd like to have your name or channels listed and linked here as a governance resource, submit
a ticket in the Helium [Docs Repo][docs-issues].
