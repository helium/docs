## What is Helium Governance?

Helium governance exists to manage the process by which the network can be modified, whether in its
technical architecture, the token's economic model, or meta-governance changes. It is governed by
the global community of owners of Helium tokens ([HNT](/tokens/hnt-token),
[MOBILE](/tokens/mobile-token), or [IOT](/tokens/iot-token)). These token owners include Hotspot
deployers, network users, wireless network operators, hardware manufacturers, and more. Tokens must
be locked for voting on network changes, ensuring long-term stakeholder alignment.

Anyone can submit a Helium Improvement Proposal ([HIP](/governance/hip)) as a first step to
modifying the network. All HIPs are published in the public Helium GitHub repository, then discussed
and debated in public forums, including the Helium community Discord server, and on monthly
community calls. Any Helium token owner is eligible to vote on HIPs within the domain of that
specific token. To vote, a Helium token owner must first lock their tokens for a period of time, up
to four years, which grants the owner voting power determined by the number of locked tokens and the
lock duration.

As Helium is a network of networks, there are currently three different jurisdictions for
governance:

1. Locking HNT allows for voting on HIPs governing the <u>Helium network as a whole</u>.
1. Locking IOT enables voting on HIPs governing the <u>IoT subnetwork</u>.
1. Locking MOBILE enables voting on HIPs governing the <u>mobile subnetwork</u>.

The Helium Foundation serves as a steward for the governance process. The Foundation established the
initial framework and manages the open Helium GitHub repositories. The Foundation does not vote on
HIPs but does vet proposals for compliance with the law and technical feasibility. The Foundation's
role is to provide expert advice and guidance and to guide implementation of the HIPs after they
have passed.

Information about governance is subject to change as the Helium Network constantly evolves. It is
led by the open-source community that continues to build it.
