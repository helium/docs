The Helium Community is the home to over tens of thousands developers and network operators who
collaborate every day across the world to build the Helium Network. Any and all are welcome to take
part. Join us!

## Discord

The [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) is the primary communication channel for the Helium
Network Community. Here you'll find real-time, in-depth discussion on all parts of the Helium
Network. It is also the primary venue to get support for using the Network.

## Helium Improvement Proposals

The Helium Community uses a governance mechanism called **Helium Improvement Proposals** (known as
"HIPs"). Modeled on BIPs from the Bitcoin community, as well as pulling from influences of open-source development, HIPs are used to introduce, debate, and
approve/reject new changes to major elements of the Network like the core blockchain,
$HNT, $IOT
$MOBILE token economics, and Network governance itself.

In the earliest phases it's best to vet an idea with the Helium community
[via Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). This is a good way to see if there is initial support for
the idea, or if it's been discussed before. The #hip-discussion channel is a great place to
circulate an early idea.

HIPs are managed entirely from the [HIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/helium/HIP). HIP
discussion also happens in the `Improvement Proposal` channels of
[Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). Any and all members of the Helium Community are
encouraged to create HIPs, and participate in the governance process.

## Realms

[Realms] (realms.today) is a Solana native tool for DAO infrastructure. As part of the migration to the Solana Blockchain, the Helium Community adopted Realms as it's tool for staking, delegating and on-chain voting.
This tool replaces Helium Vote.

Read [this page](XXX) to learn how to navigate Realms.

- Join the [Helium DAO](www.realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt), [IOT DAO](www.realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot) or [MOBILE DAO](www.realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile) on Realms.

## Monthly Community Calls

The Helium Community holds monthly video calls (led by the
[Helium Foundation](https://www.helium.foundation/)). These typically happen on the the **4th
Wednesday of each month at 12PM ET**. Each call has an open agenda, and any community member can
join and add items to the agenda to be discussed.
