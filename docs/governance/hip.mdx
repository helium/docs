Helium Improvement Proposals ("HIPs") are the core unit of change in the Helium Network and for the
Helium Community.

## How an Idea Becomes a HIP

1. **Idea Stage:** HIPs start as ideas for improving an aspect of economic, technical, or
   meta-governance.
2. **Drafting Stage:** Generally, when enough community members believe the idea is worth
   formulating into a HIP, they do so and submit that HIP as a draft to the Helium
   [HIP Repository](https://github.com/helium/hip).
3. **Editing Stage:** HIP Editors assist HIP Authors in clarity, consistency, and completeness. HIP
   Editors work directly with authors, but everyone is able to provide feedback before the HIP moves
   forward. Sometimes, a HIP is never fully complete and in that case, does not move beyond the
   draft stage.
4. **Discussion Stage:** A HIP becomes a full-fledged proposal and is made available for the
   community to discuss. HIPs last in the Discussion Stage for at least 2 weeks, but often more
   depending on the type of discussion and how critical the change is. Moderators help manage HIP
   discussions to keep them on topic.
5. **Rough Consensus Stage:** After deliberate discussion, a HIP Editor seeks a point in time for
   Consensus, which is typically done through a Temperature Check vote in Discord. This vote is
   non-binding and gives HIP Editors a sense of HIP readiness.
6. **Voting Stage:** After the community has come to a consensus on if a HIP is ready to go to a
   network-wide vote, the HIP Editor and Helium Foundation will execute the voting contract and
   communicate the vote out. All token holders are eligible to vote on the HIP at this time.
7. **Implementation Stage:** After the HIP receives a vote, if it passes 2/3 majority vote, then the
   HIP is Approved and Helium Core Developers will go to work on implementing it. If the HIP is
   rejected, the Proposal is effectively closed.

## Implemented HIPs

All HIPs that have passed and been implemented in the Helium Community are listed below. Not all
HIPs pass super-majority voting, so you will see some changes in HIP numbers as you go down this
list. Just like bills that become law, HIPs often amend each other. To get a full understanding of
how HIPs have been implemented and how each impacts another, join the Helium Discord. Long-time
Community Members are a wealth of knowledge and can help folks understand changes over time.

Note: the current status of HIPs 'In Discussion', 'Closed', or that are being actively deployed can
be found at www.github.com/helium/hip
