Helium Improvement Proposals ("HIPs") are the core unit of change in the Helium Network and for the
Helium Community.

---

## How a HIP Becomes a Vote

A vote can be created by opening a PR against the
[Helium Vote repository](https://github.com/helium/helium-vote/). Templates are provided within the
repo. Authors are encouraged to write their HIP description in a nonbiased manner and are subject to
review. In partnership with the Helium Foundation, a block height deadline, vote ID, and voting
addresses will be provided.

---

## Previous HIPs

All HIPs that have passed and been implemented in the Helium Community are listed below. Not all
HIPs pass super-majority voting, so you will see some changes in HIP numbers as you go down this
list. Just like bills that become law, HIPs often amend each other. To get a full understanding of
how HIPs have been implemented and how each impacts another, join the Helium Discord. Long-time
Community Members are a wealth of knowledge and can help folks understand changes over time.

Note: the current status of HIPs 'In Discussion', 'Closed', or that are being actively deployed can
be found at www.github.com/helium/hip
