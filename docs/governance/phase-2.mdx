## Phase 2: Helium Vote

As the Helium Network quickly grew, the Community moved to utilize their custom form of on-chain
voting with Heliumvote.com (also, https://helium.vote/). This became the sole platform for proposal
voting from November 2021 until the blockchain migration on April 18th, 2023. Users cast an on-chain
vote by submitting a Data Credit (DC) burn transaction. The movement to on-chain voting was a step
to mature the Helium Community voting processes and formalize voting with an immutable record.

### Where can I see what was voted on?

Heliumvote.com holds all the past results of proposal voting on the Helium L1 Blockchain, starting
with HIP 39 and ending with HIP 81. There, you can view proposals, how many votes were submitted,
and the HNT weight represented in voting populations. The source code can be found here:
www.github.com/helium/helium-vote.

### Where can I see the results of the vote?

You can see the results of the vote on Heliumvote.com directly. Each proposal that was voted on will
be found under “Closed Votes”.

### How can I see how each user/wallet individually voted?

Users can query the old Helium Blockchain through a publicly supplied data analytics tool hosted on
Metabase: https://etl.dewi.org/.

Additionally, during the helium.vote phase of voting, users submitted Data Credit (DC) burn
transactions to a Helium-specific wallet address to cast their on-chain vote. This allowed
helium.vote to query each wallet address for all transactions and display total vote numbers for
“For” or “Against” vote tallies. These wallet addresses with DC burn transactions can be read by
examining the open-source code within the helium-vote Repository: www.github.com/helium/helium-vote
and utilizing the legacy Helium Explorer to query the old Helium Blockchain:
https://explorer-old.helium.com/. If you would like to review the results of a vote by individual
wallet, feel free to utilize these instructions above or reach out to the Helium Foundation for
assistance.

### How do I vote?

All voting ceased to function on Helium Vote on April 18th, 2023, when the Helium Community migrated
to the Solana Blockchain. As of April 18th, 2023, all voting is conducted on Realms.
