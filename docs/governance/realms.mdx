## Voting on Realms

As part of the Solana migration, Realms is the new on-chain voting tool for the Helium Community.
This replaces Helium Vote.

To approve or deny changes to the blockchain, economics, or governance of the Helium Network; The
Helium Network leverages on-chain voting which is open to the entire community. This on-chain voting
is facilitated through the website [Realms](https://realms.today).

## Staking

To vote in the Helium DAO, you must stake HNT. Staking HNT will give you voting power in the DAO.
The same function applies to each subDAO, including the IOT and MOBILE subDAOs today, and new DAOs
in the future. When you stake HNT, you'll receive veHNT in your wallet. This represents a position
you have in the DAO and on your HNT. It is not tradable.

## On-Chain Fees

All veHNT holders can vote by issuing a small SOL token transaction from their wallet. Ballot
options will typically be `For` or `Against`.
