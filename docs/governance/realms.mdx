## How to Vote on Realms

Like many other Solana Ecosystem projects, Helium uses Realms to organize and manage governance,
vote escrowed tokens, delegation, and more. Using the links below, you can cast your vote for the
subDAO of which you seek to impact and contribute to.

Ensure that you have a Solana-ready wallet that is funded with some SOL and one of the network
tokes: HNT, IOT, or MOBILE.

### Signing Into Realms

Use your account that holds your veHNT positions to sign in to Realms. The same account can be used
for all platforms, but it must have veTokens for the specific DAO or subDAO hosting the vote.

The links for the Realms governance portals are:

- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt][realms-hnt]
- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot][realms-iot]
- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile][realms-mobile]

Sign in to these using the in-app browser from the Helium Wallet App.

### Casting Your Vote

After you have reviewed the proposal, casting your vote is as easy as issuing a Solana transaction
for "Yes" or "No".

Note: You will need a bit of Sol to cast your veTokens for a vote.

### Understanding Vote Power

When you vote your veTokens, all positions will be attributed to your vote choice. Token positions
cannot be split within one vote on a single account.

Your vote is calculated at the time your vote is submitted. If your position is in 'decay' mode,
voting sooner means you apply greater voting power. Conversely, if a position is extended to added
to, a vote can be relinquished and re-voted to apply the new voting power.
