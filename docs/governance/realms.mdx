# Voting on Realms

As part of the Solana migration, Realms is the new on-chain voting tool for the Helium Community. This replaces Helium Vote.

In order to approve or deny changes to the blockchain, economics, or governance of the Helium
Network; The Helium Network leverages on-chain voting which is open to the entire community. This
on-chain voting is facilited through the website [Realms](https://realms.today).

# Staking

To vote in the Helium DAO, you must stake HNT. Staking HNT will give you voting power in the DAO. The same function applies to each subDAO, incuding the IOT and MOBILE subDAOs today, and new DAOs in the future.
When you stake HNT, you'll recieve veHNT in your wallet. This represents a position you have in the DAO and on your HNT. It is not tradable. 

# On-Chain Fees

All veHNT holders are able to vote by issuing a small SOL token transaction from their wallet. Ballot options will typically be `For` or `Against`. 

<!-- ## How to Vote on Realms -->

The first thing you need to do is ensure that you have a Solana ready wallet that is funded with some SOL and HNT. 
Once you have that ready navigate to the Helium DAO, IOT DAO or MOBILE DAO at https://app.realms.today/. 
There you should be met with a screen that looks similar to this one.
