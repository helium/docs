## Voting on Realms

As part of the Solana migration, Realms is the new on-chain voting tool for the Helium Community.
This replaces Helium Vote.

To approve or deny changes to the blockchain, economics, or governance of the Helium Network; The
Helium Network leverages on-chain voting which is open to the entire community. This on-chain voting
is facilitated through the website [Realms](https://realms.today).

---

## Staking

To vote in the Helium DAO, you must stake HNT. Staking HNT will give you voting power in the DAO.
The same function applies to each subDAO, including the IOT and MOBILE subDAOs today, and new
subDAOs in the future. When you stake HNT, you'll receive veHNT in your wallet. This represents a
position of voting power for which you hold in the DAO or subDAO. It is not tradable or
transferrable.

You can learn more about Staking on Realms [here.](/vote-escrow/realms)

## What To Expect with On-Chain Voting

**On-Chain Fees:** All veToken holders must have SOL in their voting wallet to submit a vote
transaction. You can access more SOL through many different options. If you are using SOL for the
first time, check out [this onboarding and swap tool](/helium-tokens/sol-token#swap-utility).

**Ballot Options:** Proposal vote options will typically be `For` or `Against`.

## How to Vote on Realms

Like many other Solana Ecosystem projects, Helium uses Realms to organize and manage governance,
vote escrowed tokens, delegation, and more. Using the links below, you can cast your vote for the
subDAO of which you seek to impact and contribute to.

Ensure that you have a Solana-ready wallet that is funded with some SOL and one of the network
tokes: HNT, IOT, or MOBILE.

### Signing Into Realms

Use your account that holds your veHNT positions to sign in to Realms. The same account can be used
for all platforms, but it must have veTokens for the specific DAO or subDAO hosting the vote.

The links for the Realms governance portals are:

- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt)
- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot)
- [https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile)

### Casting Your Vote

After you have reviewed the proposal, casting your vote is as easy as issuing a Solana transaction
for "Yes" or "No".

Note: You will need a bit of Sol to cast your veTokens for a vote.

### Understanding Vote Power

When you vote your veTokens, all positions will be attributed to your vote choice. Token positions
cannot be split within one vote on a single account.

Your vote is calculated at the time your vote is submitted. If your position is in 'decay' mode,
voting sooner means you apply greater voting power. Conversely, if a position is extended to added
to, a vote can be relinquished and re-voted to apply the new voting power.

## Staying Informed

The majority of HIP discussion happens on the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium). Many HIPs
get their start in the #hip-discussion channel. Additionally, each HIP under consideration gets its
own channel for focused discussion.

When HIPs are open for vote, notifications are sent by the Helium Foundation on Discord, Twitter,
and push notifications in the Helium Wallet App.
