Helium utilizes [Modular Governance](https://github.com/helium/modular-governance) which is an open
application built by the Helium Foundation to organize and manage vote escrow tokens, delegation,
and more. Modular Governance is deployed as [Helium Vote](https://heliumvote.com). Positions can be
created and later managed within Helium Vote at any time at [heliumvote.com](https://heliumvote.com)
or within the Helium Wallet App.

## Creating a Position

Anyone with HNT, MOBILE, or IOT tokens in their Helium Wallet App or Solana-compatible browser
wallet (such as Phantom or Backpack) can create a position. These positions can be used for voting
in Helium Network or subnetwork governance.

In the case of positions created from HNT, the position can be [delegated](#delegating-stakes) to a
subnetwork in order to reinforce that network's protocol score and earn a portion of its token
emissions. While IOT or MOBILE positions can be created through their respective subnetworks, those
positions are only eligible for voting power and cannot currently be delegated for the purposes of
earning rewards.

This guide outlines using Helium Vote with the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). To
use Helium Vote on a desktop browser, a Solana-compatible browser wallet can be used (such as
Phantom or Backpack) by navigating to [heliumvote.com](https://heliumvote.com).

### Staking in the Helium Wallet App

Staking in the Helium Wallet App can be done by navigating to the "Governance" tab within the Helium
Wallet. Ensure you select the token you want to lock up (HNT, MOBILE or IOT) at the top.

  />
  <figcaption>
    The Governance tab is the fourth tab from the left. The HNT button at the top is the default
    selection.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

Once in the "Governance" tab, you will see "Your Voting Power". Click "Your Voting Power" to see
your total voting power, and for the ability to lock HNT/MOBILE/IOT.

  />
  <figcaption>
    Positions can be made and viewed in the "Your Voting Power" section of Helium Vote
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

As long as HNT, MOBILE or IOT is available in your linked account, new positions can be created by
tapping on the "Lock Tokens" button within the governance view.

### Lockup Period {#lockup-period}

To build a secure voting system, Helium gives priority to votes from token holders willing to align
themselves with the long-term health of the Helium Network. This is done by allowing holders to lock
up their tokens to receive a vote-escrow position in proportion to the amount of tokens and time
allocated to the position. The longer tokens are locked up, the greater the vote power of the
position.

Two lockup period types are available.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">

  <figcaption>Selecting your lockup type, Decaying or Constant.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

#### Decaying

Tokens are locked for a fixed duration and are released in full at the end of the defined lockup
period. Vote power declines linearly until release. This effectively starts the cooldown at the
moment of lockup.

You will be required to close the position to return the locked HNT to your wallet after the
cooldown period has ended.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">

    src={useBaseUrl('img/modular-governance/decaying.jpg')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 'initial', padding: '0 0 8px 0' }}
  />
  <figcaption>
    You lock 10.000 tokens with a lockup duration of one year. They are then unavailable for the
    next one year. After this time, you can withdraw them again.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Constant

Tokens are locked indefinitely. At any time you can start the unlock process which lasts for the
initially chosen lockup duration. Vote power stays constant until you start the unlock process, then
it declines linearly over the lockup period until release.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('img/modular-governance/constant-lockup.jpg')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 'initial', padding: '0 0 8px 0' }}
  />
  <figcaption>
    You lock 10.000 tokens with a lockup duration of one year. After three years you decide to start
    the unlocking process. Another year after that, you can withdraw the tokens.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Duration

The duration of your cooldown is set in units of days. The longer your tokens are locked up, the
more veHNT/veMOBILE/veIOT will be issued. If you chose the 'Constant' lockup period, this duration
takes effect after the 'Unlock' action is executed.

While it is possible to set a higher duration than 4 years, no additional vote power multiplier will
be added.

### Vote Power Multiplier

veHNT/veMOBILE/veIOT positions can be strengthened by increasing the duration that they are locked
for. The resulting multiplier designates the amount of vote and delegation power (delegate power
only applicable to veHNT) of the position. It is not indicative of an investment return.

In other words, if you locked up 10 HNT for 6 months, you'd get the same 10 HNT back 6 months later.
During this time you would be able to [delegate](#delegating-stakes) your position to a network to
get a return in that network's tokens.

Positions created during the [landrush](#landrush) period received an additional 3x multiplier on
the overall lockup multiplier.

  />
  <figcaption>
    The multiplier affects a position's voting and delegation power but does not mean more HNT is
    returned.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Delegating to a Subnetwork (veHNT Only) {#delegating-stakes}

A position will not earn any token return until it is delegated to a subnetwork. A position without
delegation earns voting rights, but no token return.

Once you select how much HNT you want to lock up, an interface will appear to allow you to delegate
your veHNT to a subnetwork for rewards.

    src={useBaseUrl('/img/modular-governance/delegate-to-subdao.jpeg')}

    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
  <figcaption>
    You may choose to delegate your HNT position to either the MOBILE or IOT subnetwork.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Confirming your Position

Once parameters are settled in the Helium Vote UI, you are now ready to create your
veHNT/veMOBILE/veIOT position.

The Helium Wallet App will ask for confirmation before issuing the Solana transaction that creates
the veHNT/veMOBILE/veIOT position.

  />
  <figcaption>
    After pressing "Lock Tokens", a Solana transaction is issued to create the position.

</figure>

## Managing Positions

### Undelegating veHNT

Once a position has been delegated, it can be undelegated in the same interface. Delegations can be
changed at any time, however, it will take one epoch for the position to be available for
redelegation. The position must be delegated for the entire epoch to receive rewards for that epoch.
Received rewards need to be claimed manually. Only then will they be sent to the wallet the veHNT
position is in. A delegated position can only be undelegated after all accrued rewards have been
claimed.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/modular-governance/undelegate.jpeg')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 375 }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
  <figcaption>
    You will be required to approve a transaction in your wallet when you undelegate your veHNT.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Splitting a Position

A position can be divided among multiple positions. This can be helpful if you wish to delegate your
veHNT position to multiple networks (IOT or MOBILE) or set different lockup times to different
positions.

Be warned, splitting a [landrush](#landrush) position after the initial 10 day period will result in
losing the multiplier for the position being split or transferred off the position.

You must undelegate before splitting a position (veHNT only). You can redelegate after the split is
complete.

Positions that are in any active votes cannot be split. To change a position during a vote it must
be relinquished from the active vote.

### Transfer a Position

Positions cannot be transferred from one account to another. Positions can only be transferred from
one position to another within the same account. Positions can only transfer to positions of greater
or equal duration. This functionality is useful for consolidating positions. Landrush positions
cannot have more locked tokens transferred into them after the landrush period. Any veHNT
transferred out of a landrush position will lose the 3x multiplier bonus.

If a veHNT position, you must undelegate both positions before transferring. Once you've undelegated
your position, you can click on your locked position to delegate your position to a new subnetwork.

    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
  <figcaption>Once your position is undelegated, click on the position to transfer it.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Extending a Position

Extending a position will lengthen the time it will take to cooldown. Position holders may extend a
position to gain a larger multiplier for voting power or delegation purposes.

### Unlocking a Position (Cooldown)

Before a position can become unlocked, you must first undelegate any delegations you have to
existing subnetworks. If a position was created with a 'constant' [lockup period](#lockup-period),
the ability to 'Unlock' the position will be visible in the position as long as the unlock has not
yet been initiated. A constant lockup position will first need to be unlocked before the cooldown
period begins.

Unlocking the position will begin the cooldown decay process. The time this takes is the lockup
duration set during the creation of the position. Vote power value will decay to 0 during this
cooldown period.

You will be required to close the position to return the locked up HNT/MOBILE/IOT to your wallet
after the cooldown period has ended. You must claim all tokens from the position and undelegate the
position before the Close Position button is available as an option.

## Landrush {#landrush}

For the first 10 days following the Solana migration, HNT holders were eligible to lock up their HNT
for a 'landrush' bonus of 3x the locked amount.<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup>

If a landrush position is moved or split out of its original position after the first 10 days have
lapsed, the landrush bonus is forfeited.

## Automatically Created Validator Positions

For token holders operating validators through the Solana migration, a veHNT position was
automatically created based on the existing staked position previously tied to validators. The
[Validator migration guide](/solana/migration/validator-operator) is a valuable reference in
understanding specific details for former Validator operators.

These positions are not automatically delegated to a subnetwork and are set with a constant
[lockup period](#lockup-period) by default.

As a note, these Validator positions will appear as one large position.

## Possible Errors

### Insufficient SOL Balance

Creating new veHNT/veMOBILE/veIOT positions requires more SOL than standard token claims or
account-to-account transfers. To lock up your HNT you will need approximately 0.006 SOL in your
account to create the position. If you do not have enough SOL and proceed with the transaction, a
notification will appear and allow you to swap a portion of your existing HNT/MOBILE/IOT to SOL to
proceed with the transaction.
