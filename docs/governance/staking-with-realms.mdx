Like many other Solana Ecosystem projects, Helium utilizes [Realms](https://realms.heliumvote.com/) to
organize and manage vote escrow tokens, delegation, and more. Stakes can be created and later
managed within Realms at any time at <https://realms.heliumvote.com/>

## Creating a Stake

Anyone with HNT in a wallet can create a stake using Realms either using an in-wallet browser or a
browser-connected wallet.

While staking IOT or MOBILE tokens is possible through their respective subDAOs, those positions are
only eligible for voting power and cannot currently be delegated for the purposes of earning
rewards.

This guide outlines using Realms with the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). To use
Realms on a desktop browser, a Solana-compatible browser wallet can be used (such as Phantom or
Backpack).

The Helium Wallet App's browser can be accessed via the globe icon in the bottom navigation.

### Signing Into Realms

Connect your account to Realms using the in-app browser from the Helium Wallet App.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

Once your wallet has been connected to Realms, your token balances (or existing positions) will be
displayed in the governance section of the DAO.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/availabletokens.png')} />
  <figcaption>
    Stake positions can be made in the "My governance power" section of Realms
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

As long as HNT is available in your linked account, new stakes can be created by tapping on the
"Lock Tokens" button within the governance view.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/locktokensbtn.png')} />
</figure>

### Lockup Period

To build a secure voting system, Helium only allows votes from token holders willing to align
themselves with the long-term health of the Helium Network. This is done by allowing holders to
receive veHNT in proportion to the amount of time that the tokens are staked for.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/lockup.png')} />
  <figcaption>Selecting your lockup type, Decaying or Constant.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Decaying

Tokens are locked for a fixed duration and are released in full at the end of the defined lockup
period. Vote weight declines linearly until release. This effectively starts the cooldown at the
moment of staking.

You will be required to close the position to return the staked HNT to your wallet after the
cooldown period has ended.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/cliffgraph.png')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 'initial', padding: '0 0 8px 0' }}
  />
  <figcaption>
    You lock 10.000 tokens with a lockup duration of one year. They are then unavailable for the
    next one year. After this time, you can withdraw them again.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Constant

Tokens are locked indefinitely. At any time you can start the unlock process which lasts for the
initially chosen lockup duration. Vote weight stays constant until you start the unlock process,
then it declines linearly until release.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/constantgraph.png')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 'initial', padding: '0 0 8px 0' }}
  />
  <figcaption>
    You lock 10.000 tokens with a lockup duration of one year. After three years you decide to start
    the unlocking process. Another year after that, you can withdraw the tokens.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Duration

The duration of your cooldown is set in units of days. The longer your tokens are staked, the more
veHNT will be issued. If you chose the 'Constant' lockup period, this duration takes effect after
the 'Unlock' action is executed.

While it is possible to set a higher duration than 4 years, no additional vote weight multiplier
will be added.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/duration.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 250 }} />
  <figcaption>Setting a longer duration results in a greater vote weight multiplier.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Stake Multiplier

veHNT positions can be strengthened by increasing the duration that they are locked for. The
resulting multiplier designates the amount of vote and delegation power of the position. It is not
indicative of an investment return.

In other words, if you staked 10 HNT for 6 months, you'd get the same 10 HNT back 6 months later.
During this time you would be able to [delegate](#delegating-stakes) your position to a network to
get a return in that network's tokens.

Positions created during the [landrush](#landrush) period received an additional 3x multiplier on
the overall lockup multiplier.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">

    style={{ maxHeight: 250, borderRadius: '40px', padding: '14px 16px 20px' }}
  />
  <figcaption>
    The multiplier affects a position's voting and delegation power but does not mean more HNT is
    returned.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Confirming your Stake

Once parameters are settled in the Realms UI, you are now ready to create your veHNT position.

The Helium Wallet App will ask for confirmation before issuing the Solana transaction that creates
the veHNT position.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/issuestake.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 300 }} />

## Managing Stakes

With Realms, it's a sizzling experience to take control of your HNT stakes, ensuring they're grilled
to perfection. Chew through stake delegation, transfers, splitting, and cooldowns like a master
chef. <span className="🥩">🥩</span>

### Delegating Stakes

A stake will not earn any token return until it is delegated to a subDAO. A stake without delegation
earns voting rights, but no token return. You can delegate an active stake within the Realms
interface.

Once a stake has been delegated, it can be undelegated in the same interface. Delegations can be
changed at any time, however, it will take one epoch for the position to be available for
redelegation. The stake must be delegated for the entire epoch to receive rewards for that epoch.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/delegate.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 300 }} />
  <figcaption>veHNT positions can be delegated to the IoT or the Mobile network.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Splitting a Stake

A stake can be divided among multiple positions. This can be helpful if you wish to delegate your
veHNT position to multiple networks (IOT or MOBILE) or set different lockup times to different
positions.

Be warned, splitting a [landrush](#landrush) position after the initial 10 day period will result in
losing the multiplier for the position being split or transferred off the position.

You must undelegate before splitting a stake. You can redelegate after the split is complete.

Positions that are in any active votes cannot be split. To change a position during a vote it must
be relinquished from the active vote.

### Transfer a Stake

Staked positions cannot be transferred from one account to another. Stakes can only be transferred
from one position to another within the same account. Positions can only transfer to positions of
greater or equal duration. This functionality is useful for consolidating positions. Landrush
positions cannot have more locked tokens transferred into them after the landrush period. Any veHNT
transferred out of a landrush position will lose the 3x multiplier bonus.

You must undelegate both positions before transferring a stake between positions. Transferring to a
new position requires the original position to be undelegated. You can redelegate one or both
positions after the split is complete.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/transfer.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 300 }} />
  <figcaption>A position can be transferred in full or in part.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Extending a Stake

Extending a stake will lengthen the time it will take to unstake. Position holders may extend a
stake to gain a larger multiplier for voting power or delegation purposes. Extending a staking
period does not add additional time to the stake, it instead updates the existing stake period to
the new selection.

### Unlocking a Stake (Cooldown)

If a stake was created with a 'constant' [lockup period](#lockup-period), the ability to 'Unlock'
the position will be visible in the position as long as the unlock has not yet been initiated. A
constant lockup position will first need to be unlocked before the cooldown period begins.

Unlocking the position will begin the cooldown decay process. The time this takes is the lockup
duration set during the creation of the position. And your veHNT value will decay to 0 veHNT during
this cooldown period.

You will be required to close the position to return the staked HNT to your wallet after the
cooldown period has ended. You must claim all tokens from the position and undelegate the position
before the Close Position button is available as an option.

  <figcaption>
    This position will unlock over the period of 2 years once the unlock has been initiated.

</figure>

## Landrush

For the first 10 days following the Solana migration, HNT holders were eligible to stake their HNT
for a 'landrush' bonus of 3x the locked amount.<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup>

If a landrush stake is moved or split out of its original position after the first 10 days have
lapsed, the landrush bonus is forfeited.

## Automatically Created Validator Stakes

For existing validators, a veHNT position is automatically created based on the existing staked
position previously tied to Validators. The
[Validator migration guide](/solana/migration/validator-operator) is a valuable reference in
understanding specific details for former Validator operators.

These positions are not automatically delegated to a subDAO and are set with a constant
[lockup period](#lockup-period) by default.

As a note, these Validator positions will appear as one large stake. `hntyv...` is the Solana mint
address for HNT.

## Possible Errors

### Insufficient SOL Balance

Creating new veHNT positions requires more SOL than standard token claims or account-to-account
transfers. To stake your HNT you will need approximately 0.006 SOL in your account to create the
position.
