# Voting on Helium

In order to approve or deny changes to the blockchain, economics, or governance of the Helium
Network; The Helium Network leverages on-chain voting which is open to the entire community. This
on-chain voting is currently facilited through [Realms](https://www.realms.today).

# Key Terms

Vote Escrowed (ve): A position created by staking your tokens which only functions for DAO or subDAO voting.
veHNT: A position created by staking your HNT. 
Voting Power: 100 veHNT is more than 10 veHNT. The higher amount would mean you have more weight in deciding vote outcomes. The more HNT you stake for veHNT the more voting power you have.
Realms: A Solana native tool for DAO and Treasury management. 

# Voting Power

The token veHNT is currently what determines both your ability to vote on Helium Improvement Proposals as well as your voting power.
You must stake HNT for veHNT to vote on Helium Improvement Proposals.

Your veHNT represents your Voting Power. You can think about Voting Power as the weight your vote holds towards voting outcomes. 

Voting power may change vote-to-vote, depending on what the
community is reaching consensus on. As example, a vote on on frequency plan for a region would only
concern Hotspots in the region and one would use number Hotspots in the region as votes. Proposals
to implement more involved voting mechanisms have been presented, but have not been voted on or
implemented yet. See:
[HIP41](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0041-governance-by-token-lock-v2.md)

HNT holders are able to vote by issuing a small transaction from their wallet to Realms. The transaction cost to vote is very low.
