To approve or deny changes to the blockchain, economics, or governance of the Helium Network; The
Helium Network leverages on-chain voting which is open to the entire community. This on-chain voting
is currently facilitated through [Realms](https://www.realms.today).

## Key Terms

- **Vote Escrowed ("ve")**: A position created by staking your tokens which only functions for DAO
  or subDAO voting.
- **Voting Power**: 100 veHNT is more than 10 veHNT. The higher amount would mean you have more
  weight in deciding vote outcomes. The more HNT you stake for veHNT the more voting power you have.
- **Realms**: A Solana native tool for DAO and Treasury management.
- **veHNT**: A position created by staking your HNT.
- **veIOT:** A position created by staking your IOT. Used for IOT Network governance.
- **veMOBILE:** A position created by staking your MOBILE. Used for MOBILE Network governance.

## veTokens and Voting

Token holders can vote by 'staking' their tokens to the protocol that they are voting for. This
mechanism helps to ensure that the voter holds a long-term interest in the success of the Helium
Network. veTokens come in several forms with specific responsibilities to segments of the network.

Each subDAO governs a specific area of the network. Initially, two subDAOs are introduced: IOT and
MOBILE. Voting on the IOT and MOBILE networks will require veIOT and veMOBILE respectively.

### veHNT

The [Helium DAO](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt) and the Helium Network serve as the
overarching system that enables a multitude of networks (subDAOs) to exist. As such, veHNT's role in
network governance is in matters affecting the entire network. For example, a proposal affecting HNT
emissions would be voted on using veHNT.

Additionally, veHNT can be [delegated](/vote-escrow/realms#delegating-stakes) to a subDAO in order
to earn a portion of that network's tokens.

### veIOT

The [IOT subDAO](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/iot) focuses on the original vision of the Helium
Network, supporting the growth and development of IoT devices and applications. Staking your IOT
tokens to the IOT subDAO grants veIOT which can be used to vote on matters specific to the IOT
network. For example, a proposal affecting proof of coverage behavior for IoT Hotspots.

### veMOBILE

The [MOBILE subDAO](https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/mobile) is dedicated to the growth and
expansion of the Helium Network in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Staking your IOT
tokens to the IOT subDAO grants veIOT which can be used to vote on matters specific to the IOT
network. For example, a proposal affecting proof of coverage behavior for IoT Hotspots.
