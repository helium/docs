## Working Groups

The People's Network continues to see innovation fueled by community engagement and strong feedback
loops. Working Groups are small circles of highly engaged members of the community dedicated to
understanding specific aspects of the Helium Network, identifying challenges and opportunities, and
advocating a path forward to the larger community based on thoughtful consideration.

The Helium Community often establishes Working Groups based on several high-level needs:

1. Research & Development
2. Stewardship & Guidance

Working Groups self-organize and sunset as needed. They are volunteer-based.

You can find more information below about all _active_ working groups.

### IoT Working Group

The IoT Working Group was created to develop guidance on improvements to the IoT Network. The
Working Group is made up of volunteers and stewarded by the Helium Foundation. The IoT Network is
Helium's original and largest subnetwork. During its long history, it has been governed by some of
the most important Helium Improvement Proposals (HIPs) ever published ([HIP 10][hip-10], [HIP
15][hip-15], [HIP 17][hip-17], [HIP 19][hip-19], etc). Its continued success depends on the Working
Group's ability to incentivize LoRaWAN Hotspot deployments in a manner that encourages network
growth and useful coverage.

The Group consists of Community members that are self-nominated and voted in by the Community.
Future membership is open and membership can be obtained by contributing to the weekly open sessions
on Discord. Members meet for 1 hour every Monday at GMT 8PM to work on HIPs.

You can find the IoT Working Group Charter [here][iot-wg-charter].

### Mobile Working Group

The Mobile Working Group was created to develop guidance on improvements to the 5G-CBRS PoC
algorithm and has expanded its scope to cover all aspects of the Mobile Network.

The goal of the Mobile Working Group is to work collaboratively on the HIPs, strategies, and
policies that improve and advance the Mobile subnetwork to ultimately drive incentives for creating
coverage, quality installations, and elegant tokenomics.

The Group consists of 5-10 Community members that are self-nominated and voted in by the Community
for six-month terms. Members will meet for 1 hour each week to work on the HIPs.
