## Working Groups

The Helium Community often establishes Working Groups based on several needs:
1. Research & Development 
2. Stewardship & Guidance

Working Groups self organize and sunset as needed. They are volunteer based.

### IOT PoC Working Group

The IOT Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) Working Group was created to develop guidance on improvements to the original PoC algorithm. The Working Group is made up of 10 volunteers and stewarded by the Helium Foundation.
he IoT network is Helium’s original and largest sub-network. During its long history it has been governed by some of the most important Helium Improvement Proposals (HIPs) ever published (HIP-10, HIP-15, HIP-17, HIP-19, etc). Its continued success depends on the Working Group's ability to incentivize LoRaWAN Hotspot deployments in a manner that encourages network growth and useful coverage. Helium’s IoT Proof-of-Coverage system is the unique engine behind it all. 

The Group consists of 10 Community members that were self-nominated and voted in by the Community for three months. Members will meet for 30 minutes each week to work on the HIPs.

### MOBILE PoC Working Group

The MOBILE Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) Working Group was created to develop guidance on improvements to the 5g-CBRS PoC algorithm.

Success of the MOBILE network is critically tied to the Group's ability to quickly build and roll out an effective Proof-of-Coverage framework that incentivizes useful coverage.

The Group consistz of 10 Community members that were self-nominated and voted in by the Community for three months. Members will meet for 30 mins each week to work on the HIPs.

## Past Working Groups

Working Groups are an effective way of creating alignment and advancement on short term needs.  See the list below for some of the Working Groups that have helped shape the development of the network over time:
1. Readiness Working Group
2. LoRaWAN Working Group
