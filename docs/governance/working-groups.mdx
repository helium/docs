## Working Groups

The People’s Network continues to see innovation fueled by community engagement and strong feedback
loops. Working Groups are small circles of highly engaged members of the community dedicated to
understanding specific aspects of the Helium Network, identifying challenges and opportunities, and
advocating a path forward to the larger community based on thoughtful consideration.

The Helium Community often establishes Working Groups based on several high-level needs:

1. Research & Development
2. Stewardship & Guidance

Working Groups self-organize and sunset as needed. They are volunteer-based.

You can find more information below about all _active_ working groups.

### IOT PoC Working Group

The IOT Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) Working Group was created to develop guidance on improvements to the
original PoC algorithm. The Working Group is made up of 10 volunteers and stewarded by the Helium
Foundation. The IoT network is Helium’s original and largest sub-network. During its long history,
it has been governed by some of the most important Helium Improvement Proposals (HIPs) ever
published (HIP-10, HIP-15, HIP-17, HIP-19, etc). Its continued success depends on the Working
Group's ability to incentivize LoRaWAN Hotspot deployments in a manner that encourages network
growth and useful coverage. Helium’s IoT Proof-of-Coverage system is the unique engine behind it
all.

The Group consists of 10 Community members that were self-nominated and voted in by the Community
for three months. Members will meet for 30 minutes each week to work on the HIPs.

### MOBILE PoC Working Group

The MOBILE Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) Working Group was created to develop guidance on improvements to
the 5g-CBRS PoC algorithm.

The success of the MOBILE network is critically tied to the Group's ability to quickly build and
roll out an effective Proof-of-Coverage framework that incentivizes useful coverage.

The Group consists of 10 Community members that were self-nominated and voted in by the Community
for three months. Members will meet for 30 mins each week to work on the HIPs.
