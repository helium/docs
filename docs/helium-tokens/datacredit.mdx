Data Credits are the mechanism by which all usage is paid and accounted for on the Helium Network.
The same Data Credit token can be used interchangeably on any Network within Helium. However, once
Data Credits have been delegated, they cannot be redelegated. Data Credits are not transferable once
created.

For further reading on Data Credits and their place in the overall token mechanics of the Helium
Network, please read more about [burn and mint economics][bme] in the HNT token documentation.

## Data Credit Usage

Data Credits are used first and foremost as the payment of data transfer on the Helium IoT and
Mobile networks. In the original design of the Network, it was recognized that users of the Network
would not be comfortable with the typical volatility that comes with typical token economics.
Therefore, Data Credits were designed such that all data transfer is pinned to USD, making it
predictable. **One Data Credit equals $0.00001 USD.**

Unlike traditional wireless networks, the Helium Network has no annual fee, and you only pay for
data you use.

As the Helium Network has evolved to support multiple types of data transfer, Data Credits have
grown to handle a larger role in support of these different protocols.

### Data Credits and IoT

On the Helium IoT Network, the primary utility of Data Credits is for network data transfer. Data
transfer is billed in 24-byte increments. Data transfer is only billed if it is delivered through
the Helium Network.

Network users also have the choice to purchase multiple reports of the same packet. These additional
reports each account for their own cost. For instance, if three 24-byte copies are returned for a
given message, the cost would be 3 DC.

#### Data Transfer Calculator

Use this calculator to estimate deployment costs based on the number of devices and how often they
send data.

This calculator assumes a 24-byte message size which is typical of most deployments.

#### Protocol Fees

In addition to Network data transfer, Data Credits are also utilized for certain network-related
fees.

| Action            | Fee                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Device Onboarding | $40                                     |
| Assert Location   | $10<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup>         |
| OUI               | $100                                    |
| DevAddr           | $100 ($800)<sup>(</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup> |

[^1]:
    [HIP-69][hip-69] sets the assert location fee to $5 for three months following the Solana
    migration.

[^2]: DevAddrs must be purchased in slabs of 8.

### Data Credits and Mobile

In much the same design as the IoT network, the cellular network leverages Data Credits as the sole
mechanism of billing and fee management. However, as a separate protocol, different pricing
mechanics apply. While the IoT network charges data at a rate of $0.00001 per 24-byte message, the
Mobile network charges data at a rate of **$0.50 per 1 gigabyte** (50,000 DC).

On cellular networks, it is customary that network operators bill for bulk data rather than for
individual packets. By setting the data cost to $0.50 per gigabyte, the Helium Mobile Network
positions itself competitively in the marketplace while preserving valuable rewards for the mobile
Hotspot Operator.

#### Protocol Fees

Fees related to onboarding and location assert have not yet been defined for the Mobile Network.

| Action          | Fee |
| --------------- | --- |
| Onboard         | —   |
| Assert Location | —   |

## Acquiring Data Credits

### HNT Swap

If you already have HNT or your organization is comfortable using cryptocurrencies for business,
swapping HNT to Data Credits using the on-chain Helium programs is the most direct means of
acquiring Data Credits.

### Sphere Data Credit Portal

The [Data Credit Portal][dc-portal] built by [Sphere][sphere] allows Network users to acquire Data
Credits without directly holding cryptocurrency. The tool is designed for allocating Data Credits
for Network users like [LNS operators][open-lns] or mobile [service providers][service-providers].
The tool provides a clear invoice once transactions are complete to simplify accounting.
