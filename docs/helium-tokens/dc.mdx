DC is the Data Credit Token. It is required to use the Helium Network, which includes burning DC for:
1. Sending data,
2. Recieving data,
3. Roaming,
4. Reasserting Hotspots,
5. Antenna updates,
and more.

DC was introduced to the
Helium Network through the community proposal
[HIP 4](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0004-expensing-data-credits-for-lorawan.md).

If you are a onboarding and deploying devices that will be running on the Helium Network, you'll need DC to pay for using the Network.

DC can be aquired through two methods:
1. Burning HNT for DC through the Helium Wallet App 
2. Using a Credit Card to purchase DC through the Helium Console 

### Data Credits and Burn-and-Mint Economics

**Data Credits** are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from HNT in a burn transaction and used to
pay [all transaction fees](/blockchain/transaction-fees) on the Helium Network. One Data Credit will
always cost `$0.00001`. Or, `$1.00` will always buy you `100,000` Data Credits. But, as noted above,
Data Credits are produced by burning HNT. And the market price of HNT will of course fluctuate.

This HNT to DC relationship is based on a design commonly called a
[burn and mint equilibrium](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/) and is
intended to allow for the supply of HNT to respond to network usage trends such that, when
equilibrium is found, the amount of HNT that exists remains static month on month. The amount of
Data Credits produced by burning HNT will move up and down based on the USD price of HNT as reported
by the [HNT Price Oracles](/blockchain/oracles). Below are a few examples of how this works
on-chain.

**Example 1**

- As always, the price of one DC is `$.00001`
- The current HNT Oracle price is `$1`
- Burning `1` HNT would produce `100,000` DCs

**Example 2**

A Helium Network user requires `50,000` DCs per month to send data for their fleet of
Helium-connected mouse traps. To acquire these 50,000 DCs per month, they would burn .5 HNT using
the following math:

- The price of DC is `$.00001`
- The current HNT Oracle price is `$1`
- Burning `0.5` HNT would produce the needed `50,000` DCs

:::important Data Credits are non-transferrable

Once burned, DCs are owned by the Helium wallet specified in the burn transaction. They are
non-transferrable.

You can use the [Helium Data Credit Calculator](https://www.helium.com/use) to understand exactly
how much it will cost to send device data on the Network.

Not only are DCs critical for asserting new Hotspots and their location on the blockchain,
registering OUIs and devices, but they are also used to pay for every single uplink packet that is
sent on the Helium network including inital Joins. Downlinks, and ACKS do not require Data Credits.

Every 24 bytes sent in an uplink packet cost 1 DC = $.00001.

Unlike traditional wireless networks, the Helium Network has no annual fee and you only pay for data
you use. This transaction occurs between the Miner (which runs on every Helium Hotspot) and the
Helium LoRaWAN Network Server, identified by the OUI, of the device owner.

The transaction is as follows:

- A Miner receives a packet and determines who it belongs to
- The Miner dials the appropriate Helium LoRaWAN Network Server and offers the packet
- The Helium LoRaWAN Network Server expresses interest in the packet and accepts delivery
- The Miner provides the packet under the promise that the LoRaWAN Network Server will “burn a DC”
  in the name of the Miner

You may have noticed that the final step includes a promise from the Helium LoRaWAN Network Server.
The principle at work here is that each packet in its own is quite insignificant in value and so the
Miner is willing to extend this service of delivery in exchange for the promise; by doing such,
usage experiences low latencies. Should the Helium LoRaWAN Network Server fail to fulfill its
promise, the Miner would place the Helium LoRaWAN Network Server on a deny list and would no longer
route packets from any devices to this Helium LoRaWAN Network Server.
