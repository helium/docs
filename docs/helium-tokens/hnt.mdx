The Helium Token is the native cryptocurrency and protocol token of the Helium Network. Its symbol
is HNT. Before the launch of the Helium Network, there was no pre-mine of HNT. The first HNT was
produced on July 29th, 2019 on
[block 93](https://explorer-old.helium.com/txns/sEP-cbb2tvSrfbBleT21yGDNM8FIjNr3UT3k3BeZELw).

## Helium Token Usage

The Helium Token is designed to serve the needs of the two primary parties in the Helium ecosystem:

1. **Hotspot Hosts and Network Operators**. Hosts mine network tokens like [IOT](/helium-tokens/iot)
   and [MOBILE](/helium-tokens/mobile) while deploying and maintaining network coverage. These
   network tokens are redeemable for HNT.
2. **Enterprises and developers using the Helium Network** to connect devices and build IoT
   applications. Data Credits, which are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from HNT in a burn
   transaction, [are used to pay transaction fees](/blockchain/transaction-fees) for wireless data
   transmissions on the network.

## HNT Token Economic Concepts

The Helium Network uses three distinct token economic concepts to ensure HNT supply is both
plentiful for network needs but also relatively scarce, with a known maximum.

### Max Supply

At launch [genesis block](https://explorer-old.helium.com/blocks/1), the Helium Network targeted
5,000,000 HNT per month. Since the community approval of
[HIP-20](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/73), the Helium Network uses a two-year halving
schedule, resulting in a maximum HNT supply of 223,000,000 HNT.

In the below issuance schedule, year 1 starts on **August 1, 2019**. The first halving happened on
day one of year three, **August 1, 2021**.

| Year | HNT at Year Start | Target HNT Emission |
| :--- | :---------------- | :------------------ |
| 1    | 0                 | 60,000,000          |
| 2    | 60,000,000        | 60,000,000          |
| 3    | 120,000,000       | 30,000,000          |
| 4    | 150,000,000       | 30,000,000          |

### Data Credits and Burn-and-Mint Economics

**Data Credits** are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from HNT in a burn transaction and used to
pay [all transaction fees](/blockchain/transaction-fees) on the Helium Network. One Data Credit will
always cost `$0.00001`. Or, `$1.00` will always buy you `100,000` Data Credits. But, as noted above,
Data Credits are produced by burning HNT. And the market price of HNT will of course fluctuate.

This HNT to DC relationship is based on a design commonly called a
[burn and mint equilibrium](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/) and is
intended to allow for the supply of HNT to respond to network usage trends such that, when
equilibrium is found, the amount of HNT that exists remains static month on month. The amount of
Data Credits produced by burning HNT will move up and down based on the USD price of HNT as reported
by the HNT [Price Oracles](/oracles/price-oracles). Below are a few examples of how this works
on-chain.

**Example 1**

- As always, the price of one DC is `$.00001`
- The current HNT Oracle price is `$1`
- Burning `1` HNT would produce `100,000` DCs

**Example 2**

A Helium Network user requires `50,000` DCs per month to send data for their fleet of
Helium-connected mouse traps. To acquire these 50,000 DCs per month, they would burn .5 HNT using
the following math:

- The price of DC is `$.00001`
- The current HNT Oracle price is `$1`
- Burning `0.5` HNT would produce the needed `50,000` DCs

:::important Data Credits are non-transferrable

Once burned, DCs are owned by the Helium wallet specified in the burn transaction. They are
non-transferrable.

### Net Emissions

At this point, the astute reader might be asking themselves the following question:

> If HNT supply is capped at 223,000,000 AND the network is constantly burning HNT to mint Data
> Credits to enable transactions, won't we run out of HNT?

**Yes.** This is where the idea of Net Emissions comes in. Along with Max Supply,
[HIP-20](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/73) also introduced the idea of Net Emissions. Net
Emissions give the protocol enough HNT to reward consensus group members and Hotspots in perpetuity.

The
[complete Net Emissions discussion in the HIP](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0020-hnt-max-supply.md#net-emissions)
is the best resource on this. A quick summary here is as follows:

- Using Net Emissions, the network would monitor how many HNT were burnt for Data Credits in a given
  epoch and add them to the number of HNT to be minted that epoch. For example, if 10 HNT were
  burned for Data Credits in an epoch, the system would mint 10 more HNT than were expected in that
  given epoch.
- Because HNT produced via Net Emissions do not add to the total outstanding, they do not violate
  max supply.
- However, Net Emissions would counteract the desired, deflationary effect of Burn and Mint. If the
  system replaces all the HNT that are burned to create Data Credits, there is no resulting
  reduction of supply.
- Because of this, when implemented, there will be a cap on the number of HNT that can be created
  via Net Emissions per epoch. When the HNT burned for DCs exceeds this cap, there will be a
  reduction in supply.
