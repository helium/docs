IOT is the protocol token of the [Helium IoT Network](/lorawan-on-helium). IOT was introduced to the
Helium Network through the community proposal
[HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md) and is further defined in
subsequent HIPs<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]<sup>)</sup>. The
first IOT tokens were minted following the Solana migration on April 18, 2023.

[^1]:
    [HIP-70: Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md)

[^2]:
    [HIP-76: Linear Lockup Curve](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0076-linear-lockup-curve.md)

[^3]: [HIP-77: Solana Parameters](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0077-solana-parameters.md)
[^4]:
    [HIP-80: Simplifying DAO Utility Score](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0080-simplifying-dao-utility-score.md)

The IOT token is mined by LoRaWAN Hotspots through both data transfer proceeds as well as Proof of
Coverage.

The mint address for IOT is
[`iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns)
on the Solana blockchain.

## Redemption for HNT

Protocol tokens like IOT will always be backed by HNT and will convert to HNT. To enable this, each
network within the Helium Network is allocated a pool of HNT based on the Network Utility Score. The
redemption ratio is set algorithmically by the treasury swap contacts based on this Network Utility
Score.

The [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) serves as the primary platform for exchanging
IOT to HNT. This transaction can also be performed directly through the Solana blockchain using the
open source tooling found in the Helium GitHub repositories.

## Token Allocation

IOT follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of 200,000,000,000 (200B).

The issuance is scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT issuance halvings.

The emission schedule is as follows:

| Year | IOT at Year Start | IOT Minted | Proof of Coverage \* | Data Transfer \* | Oracles \*\* | Operations Fund | veHNT Stakes |

**\*** Any IOT not rewarded for data transfer is rolled into Proof of Coverage.  
**\*\*** Oracles are not rewarded until additional oracle operators deploy services. This pool is
rolled over to Proof of Coverage.
