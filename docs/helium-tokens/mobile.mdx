MOBILE is the protocol token of the [Helium Mobile Network](/5g-on-helium). MOBILE was introduced to
the Helium Network through the community proposal
[HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md) and is further defined in
subsequent HIPs<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]<sup>)</sup>.

The MOBILE token is mined by 5G Hotspots through both data transfer proceeds as well as Proof of
Coverage.

The mint address for MOBILE is
[`mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6)
on the Solana blockchain.

## Redemption for HNT

Protocol tokens like MOBILE will always be backed by HNT and will convert to HNT. To enable this,
each network within the Helium Network is allocated a pool of HNT based on the Network Utility
Score. The redemption ratio is set algorithmically by the treasury swap contacts based on this
Network Utility Score.

The [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) serves as the primary platform for exchanging
MOBILE to HNT. This transaction can also be performed directly through the Solana blockchain using
the open source tooling found in the [Helium GitHub repositories](https://github.com/helium).

## Token Allocation

MOBILE follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of 250,000,000,000 (250B).
50B MOBILE were pre-mined at the launch of the network and distributed to the network operations
fund administered by the Helium Foundation. A fraction of this allocation was distributed over the
course of the genesis period to live Mobile Network Hotspots.

The issuance is scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT issuance halvings.

The emission schedule is as follows:

| Year | MOBILE at Year Start | MOBILE Minted | Proof of Coverage \* | Hotspot Data \* | Mappers | Service Providers | Oracles \*\* | veHNT Stakers |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |

> Full token emissions can be viewed in the MOBILE section of this document:
> [Token Emissions as of Solana Migration](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/HIP-solana-parameters/token-emissions-as-of-solana-migration.pdf)

**\*** Any MOBILE not rewarded for data transfer is rolled into Proof of Coverage.  
**\*\*** Oracles are not rewarded until additional oracle operators deploy services. This pool is
rolled over to Proof of Coverage.  
**\*\*\*** 50B pre-mine, 66B emitted in year one.
