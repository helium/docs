The Helium Network now utilizes the Solana blockchain, which is extremely fast, scalable, and
low-cost. Solana has a separate token, which is called SOL. You can understand SOL as the fee to use
the Solana Network.

1. Any time you interact with the Solana blockchain, it will charge a small fee in SOL. This
   includes sending tokens, making payments, swapping tokens, minting NFTs, claiming rewards from
   your Hotspots, and all on-chain Helium transactions. Solana’s average transaction fee is 0.000014
   SOL. This is massively cheaper than the Helium L1 blockchain’s fee of $0.35 worth of DC.
2. Solana stores information, including info about your token balances, NFTs, and anything else,
   on-chain as special "accounts". Storing this information takes up valuable space, so Solana
   charges a fee called “rent” on these accounts. Each account has a rent fee, so the more accounts
   you have, the more rent is required. There is typically one account for each token type that you
   have or want. Closing accounts can return rent to your wallet. Rent for one account is ~0.002
   SOL, so it’s also pretty cheap, but more expensive than the transaction fee. In most cases, you
   get this fee back once you close the corresponding account. (Note: this fee may vary and is more
   complicated, but has a current max of ~0.002 SOL.)

If you don’t have enough SOL in your wallet, you will not be able to make transactions or make new
accounts to hold tokens. Performing more complex transactions where accounts need to be created may
require more SOL in rent than you have. This includes reasserting your Hotspot’s location, locking
HNT to gain veHNT, and potentially more complex DeFi actions where multiple accounts need to be
created (even if only temporarily). If you do not have enough SOL, you can use this tool to swap HNT
for 0.02 SOL.

## Swap Utility

Open this page from within the browser of the Helium Wallet App (Click on the Globe icon) to add the
SOL to your wallet app.

import { HntToFeeSol } from '@theme/HntToFeeSol'

For example, locking up HNT to gain veHNT creates new accounts and requires around 0.014 SOL. The
Helium Foundation has provided every single Helium wallet with 0.00139 SOL (enough for 100 standard
transfers). You may need to acquire more SOL to enable HNT lockup. We recommend having more than the
minimum amount of SOL in case you need to fund additional accounts in the future.
