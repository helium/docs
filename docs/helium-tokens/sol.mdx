The Helium Network now utilizes the Solana blockchain, which is extremely fast, scalable, and
low-cost. Solana has a separate token, which is called SOL.

1. Any time you interact with the Solana blockchain, it will charge a small fee in SOL. This
   includes sending tokens, making payments, swapping tokens, minting NFTs, claiming rewards from
   your Hotspots, and all on-chain Helium transactions. Solana’s average transaction fee is 0.000014
   SOL. This is massively cheaper than the Helium L1 blockchain’s fee of $0.35 worth of DC.
2. Solana stores information, including info about your token balances, NFTs, and anything else, on
   accounts. Storing this information takes up valuable space, so Solana charges a fee called “rent”
   on these accounts. Each account has a rent fee, so the more accounts you have, the more rent is
   required. There is typically one account for each token type that you have or want. Closing
   accounts can return rent to your wallet. Rent for one account is ~0.002 SOL, so it’s also pretty
   cheap, but more expensive than the transaction fee. In most cases, you get this fee back once you
   close the corresponding account. (Note: this fee may vary and is more complicated, but has a
   current max of ~0.002 SOL.)

If you don’t have enough SOL in your wallet, you will not be able to make transactions or make new
accounts to hold tokens. Performing more complex transactions where accounts need to be created
may require more SOL in rent than you have. This includes reasserting your Hotspot’s location,
locking HNT to gain veHNT, and potentially more complex DeFi actions where multiple accounts need to
be created (even if only temporarily). If you do not have enough sol, you can use this tool to swap
HNT for 0.2 SOL.

For example, locking up HNT to gain veHNT creates new accounts and requires about ~0.006 SOL. The
Helium Foundation has provided every single Helium wallet with 0.00139 SOL (enough for 100 standard
transfers). You will need to acquire at least 0.005 more SOL to enable HNT lockup. This is about
$0.13 in SOL. We recommend having more than that in case you need to fund additional accounts in the
future.
