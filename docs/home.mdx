## Helium Documentation

Helium is global, distributed network of Miners that create public, long-range
wireless coverage for LoRaWAN-enabled IoT devices. Miners produce and are
compensated in $HNT, the native cryptocurrency of the Helium blockchain. The
Helium blockchain is a new, open source, public blockchain created entirely to
incentivize the creation of physical, decentralized wireless networks. Today,
the Helium blockchain, and it thousands of miners, provide access to the
largest, public LoRaWAN Network in the world.

This documentation provides details on the technology that underpins Helium, as
well as how to mine HNT, and how to deploy IoT devices that use the Helium
Network. Start your journey below. If, at any time, you don't find what you
need, join us in [discord.gg/helium](https://discorg.gg/helium).
