# Overview of the Helium Network

<LegacyContentBanner />

## Introduction

The Helium Network is a decentralized, blockchain-based wireless infrastructure project that allows
individuals and organizations to deploy and operate wireless networks through token incentivization.
The Helium Network leverages the Solana blockchain for its foundation. The primary token powering the Network is
HNT, while IOT and MOBILE tokens are used to facilitate the LoRaWAN and 5G Networks, respectively.
Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) is a unique consensus algorithm employed by the subnetworks.

## Helium Network Components

**Solana Blockchain:** The underlying blockchain infrastructure that provides security, scalability,
and decentralization for the Helium Network.

**HNT Token:** The native token of the Helium Network, which is used to incentivize network
participants and facilitate transactions.

**IOT Token:** A token specific to the LoRaWAN Network, enabling low-power, wide-area network
connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. PoC is employed for the LoRaWAN subnetwork.

**MOBILE Token:** A token specific to the 5G Network, facilitating high-speed mobile connectivity
and data transmission. PoC is employed for the 5G subnetwork.

## Network Participants

**Hotspot Owners:** Individuals or organizations that deploy and maintain Helium-compatible wireless
devices (Hotspots) to provide network coverage.

**IoT Device Owners:** Users of IoT devices that leverage the Helium Network for connectivity.

**Mobile Device Users:** Users of mobile devices that access the 5G Network through the Helium
Network infrastructure.

**Developers:** Individuals or organizations that build applications and services using the Helium
Network infrastructure.

## Key Features

**Decentralized Infrastructure:** The Helium Network allows for the creation and maintenance of a
distributed wireless network by incentivizing participants to contribute resources and share the
benefits.

**Scalable and Secure:** The Helium Network leverages the Solana blockchain, which is known for its
high scalability, low latency, and robust security.

**Multi-Use Case Support:** The Helium Network supports various use cases, including IoT devices
through the LoRaWAN Network and high-speed mobile connectivity via the 5G Network.

**Incentivized Participation:** The Helium Network employs a token-based system to reward
participants and encourage network growth.

**Proof-of-Coverage (PoC):** A unique consensus algorithm employed by the LoRaWAN and 5G
subnetworks, which rewards participants for verifying wireless network coverage.
