# FAQ - Approved Hotspot Manufacturers

<LegacyContentBanner />

Nova Labs (formerly Helium Systems, Inc.) manufactured the first set of Hotspots on the Network.
Nova Labs no longer manufacturers Hotspots, but there is now an extensive list of approved
manufactures (known in the community as "Makers")

- [All approved Hotspots can be found here](https://helium.com/mine)
- [All approved Makers can be found here](/network-iot/hotspots-iot/full-hotspots).

* Please be very careful if purchasing a Helium Hotspot from a non-authorized seller. Hotspots can
  be transferred from one Helium wallet to another. Once they are added to the blockchain, only the
  owning wallet can transfer it to another. Any transfers are solely between the two entities
  ("Buyer" and "Seller"), and Helium is not involved.
* Also note that the Helium Hotspot limited warranty is only valid for the original sale to the
  original owner. Resold Helium Hotspots from anyone other than Helium directly are not under any
  warranty whatsoever. Please refer to their documentation for any authorized reseller policy.
