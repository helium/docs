# Helium is Open Source

The Helium Network is built almost entirely on open-source code. And we actively encourage the
community to develop and contribute to all parts of the Network. Below is a subset of the code that
plays an integral role in the Helium Network. The full list can be found on the official
[Helium GitHub Organization](https://github.com/helium).

## Helium Blockchain

These are the core libraries and repos that make up the Helium blockchain. Most things here are
written in Erlang.

- [Miner](https://github.com/helium/miner) - The Helium blockchain miner.

- [Blockchain Core](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core) - The glue that ties together things
  like the `Helium miner` and the `blockchain api`.

- [Blockchain API (deprecated)](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-api) - A full blockchain node
  that exposes a JSON API. It's ideal for supplying data to things like block explorers and mobile
  apps.

- [Erlang HoneyBadgerBFT](https://github.com/helium/erlang-hbbft) - An Erlang implementation of
  HoneyBadgerBFT's various protocols.

- [Erlang DKG](https://github.com/helium/erlang-dkg) - Helium's implementation of the protocol
  described in [Distributed Key Generation in the Wild](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/377.pdf).
  Prepare yourself for some math.

- [Erlang libp2p](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p) - Libp2p swarms written in (you guessed
  it) Erlang.

- [Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) - Command Line Interface, written
  in Rust, used to create and administer Helium wallets, and interact with the Helium Network.

- [Helium JS](https://github.com/helium/helium-js) - Typescript SDKs for interacting with the Helium
  blockchain.

- [Packet Purchaser](https://github.com/helium/packet-purchaser) - Service that buys Helium LoRaWAN
  packets from the Network and delivers them to a target LoRaWAN Network server.

- [Angry Purple Tiger](https://github.com/helium/angry-purple-tiger) - Ever wonder how your Miner
  got its cute little animal name? Here it is.

## LoRaWAN

The Helium Network is the largest, public LoRaWAN network in the world. This is some of the code
that makes it possible.

- [Packet Forwarder](https://github.com/helium/packet_forwarder) - Helium's fork of the Lora packet
  forwarder.

- [Light Gateway](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) - The next-generation packet forwarder for
  the Helium-enabled gateways.

- [Helium Console](https://github.com/helium/console) - A web browser front-end for users to manage
  organizations and devices and a Helium Blockchain-compatible LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS).

- [Console Decoders](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders) - A collection of LoRaWAN sensor
  decoders used in Helium Console.

### Mobile Apps, Web Apps, and Sites

- [Helium Wallet App](https://github.com/helium/wallet-app) - Helium wallet app for iOS and Android.

- [Helium Hotspot App](https://github.com/helium/hotspot-app) - Helium hotspot app for iOS and
  Android.

- [Helium Blockchain Explorer](https://github.com/helium/explorer) - Code that powers the greatest
  block explorer in the crypto world.

- [Helium Docs](https://github.com/helium/docs) - Docusaurus-based docs for all things Helium.
  (You're reading them.)

  - [Installation](/faq/docs-installation) - How to install the needed components to start
    helping docs development.

- [Helium Mappers](https://github.com/helium/mappers/) - Community generated coverage map of the
  Helium IoT Network using real-world testing.
