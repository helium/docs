# FAQ - Security

<LegacyContentBanner />

The security of the network and Hotspot owners is of the utmost importance to us. While the Internet
connection is necessary, it is only used to provide backhaul to the Hotspot for blockchain
peer-to-peer and LoRaWAN networking. As security concerns are ever present, here is what we have
done, and are doing, to combat potential risks:

- The most common attack vector to get into a device like the Hotspot is inbound ports. As of May
  2022, the Helium Hotspot no longer requires any inbound ports to be open or forwarded.
- Helium-enabled LoRaWAN devices are hardware-secured to protect the traffic from the utilized
  spectrum. This means the security is built-in since devices using the network have AES private key
  encryption at the chip level.
- All approved Helium Hotspots comply with the relevant radio and wireless regulations in the
  country or region where they are deployed. For example, Hotspots in the US comply with FCC
  regulations for operating in the unlicensed 902-928MHz spectrum, the CE mark for the European
  868MHz spectrum, etc.
- Expected bandwidth utilized by devices is 1-5kb/s (about the size of a long text message) and
  devices communicate with the Hotspot over LoRaWAN, not IP (Internet Protocol).
- While very inexpensive to use, the Helium network is not free. Any transaction requires data
  credits. This is inherently a deterrent for potential scammers.
- Helium wallets (included within the Helium App) use asymmetric keys to keep your private key
  secure.

We will be diligent in our approach to maintaining and improving all aspects of the network’s
security to help ensure that you, The People who constitute The People’s Network, can continue to
help define a new era of IoT.
