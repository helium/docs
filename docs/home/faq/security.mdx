# FAQ - Security

The security of the network and Hotspot owners is of the utmost importance to us. With the migration
 to Solana on April 18, 2023, we have taken significant steps to enhance the security and efficiency
  of the Helium Network.

While the Internet connection is necessary, it is only used to provide backhaul to the Hotspot for 
blockchain peer-to-peer and LoRaWAN networking. As security concerns are ever present, here is what 
we have done, and are doing, to combat potential risks:

- **Migration to Solana**: The Helium Network has successfully migrated to Solana, a 
high-performance blockchain platform known for its speed and security. This migration has not only 
improved the network's performance but also introduced new security measures to protect the network 
and its participants.
- **Inbound Ports**: As of May 2022, the Helium Hotspot no longer requires any inbound ports to be 
open or forwarded. This change, coupled with the migration to Solana, further reduces the attack 
surface for potential attackers.
- **Hardware-Secured LoRaWAN Devices**: Helium-enabled LoRaWAN devices remain hardware-secured to 
protect the traffic from the utilized spectrum. This means the security is built-in since devices 
using the network have AES private key encryption at the chip level. This security feature remains 
unchanged with the migration to Solana.
- **Compliance with Radio and Wireless Regulations**: All approved Helium Hotspots continue to 
comply with the relevant radio and wireless regulations in the country or region where they are 
deployed. This includes compliance with FCC regulations for operating in the unlicensed 902-928MHz 
spectrum in the US, the CE mark for the European 868MHz spectrum, and other relevant regulations.
- **Bandwidth Utilization**: The expected bandwidth utilized by devices remains 1-5kb/s (about the 
size of a long text message), and devices communicate with the Hotspot over LoRaWAN, not IP 
(Internet Protocol). This efficient use of bandwidth continues to be a key aspect of the network's 
security.
- **Transaction Costs**: While the Helium network is not free, any transaction now requires data 
credits on the Solana blockchain. This inherently acts as a deterrent for potential scammers, 
ensuring that transactions are secure and cost-effective.
- **Helium Wallets**: Helium wallets (included within the Helium App) continue to use asymmetric 
keys to keep your private key secure. This security measure remains unchanged with the migration 
to Solana, ensuring that users' assets are protected.

We are committed to maintaining and improving all aspects of the network’s security to help ensure 
that you, The People who constitute The People’s Network, can continue to help define a new era of 
IoT with enhanced security and efficiency.
