# Terminology

- [**Blockchain**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/guide/blockchain-guide-everything-you-need-to-know/) -
  A shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking
  assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible
  (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked
  and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

- **CBRS** - CBRS or 'Citizens Broadband Radio Service' is a wide broadcast
  [3.5 GHz band](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/35-ghz-band/35-ghz-band-overview)
  in the United States that does not require a 5G Hotspot Host to acquire spectrum licenses. A 5G
  Hotspot can provide 5G wireless coverage when connected to Indoor or Outdoor CBRS Small Cell
  Radios.

- **Consensus Protocols** - A set of rules that define the instructions for how to be an autonomous
  participant in a distributed computer network and come to an agreement about the exact state of
  common data.

- **Developers** - Individuals or organizations that build applications and services using the
  Helium Network infrastructure.

- **DePIN** - DePIN, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, projects use decentralized
  technology to power  
  real-world uses, such as wireless networks, street maps, rendering power, cab-hailing services,
  and more.

- **Discord** - A web-based community chat platform.

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) - A web-based platform that allows developers to collaborate,
  manage, and store their code repositories.

- [**H3 Index**](https://h3geo.org/docs/) - H3 is a system of managing global datasets and is
  pervasive throughout different Helium protocols.

- **Helium** - A global decentralized wireless network of networks utilizing a token-incentive
  model.

- [**Helium Improvement Proposals (HIP)**](https://github.com/helium/HIP) - A bill for changes to
  the network.

- [**Helium Network Token (HNT)**](/tokens/hnt-token/) - The native token of the Helium Network,
  used for incentivizing and securing the decentralized wireless network of networks through
  redemption and swap features.

- [**Helium Packet Router (HPR)**](/iot/setup-a-packet-forwarder#packet-forwarder-architecture) - a
  Helium compatible LoRaWAN Network Server ("LNS"); this component is interested in receiving the
  packets relating to its devices and handles downlink responses when appropriate.

- **Hotspot Owners** - Individuals or organizations that deploy and maintain Helium-compatible
  wireless devices (Hotspots) to provide network coverage.

- **IoT Device Owners** - Users of IoT devices that leverage the Helium Network for connectivity.

- [**IOT Subnetwork Token (IOT)**](/tokens/iot-token) - A token specific to the LoRaWAN Network,
  enabling low-power, wide-area network connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. PoC is
  employed for the LoRaWAN subnetwork.

- **Mobile Device Users** - Users of mobile devices that access the 5G Network through the Helium
  Network infrastructure.

- [**MOBILE Subnetwork (MOBILE)**](/tokens/mobile-token) - A token specific to the 5G-CBRS Network,
  facilitating high-speed mobile connectivity and data transmission. PoC is employed for the 5G
  subnetwork.

- **Node** - Refers to individual devices or computers that participate in maintaining the network
  by storing a copy of the blockchain, validating transactions, and relaying information to achieve
  consensus.

- **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** - A unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain and is
  used to certify ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided.

- [**Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**](/iot/lorawan-on-helium#organizationally-unique-identifier) -
  Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs) are registered identities on the Helium Blockchain. To
  send and receive packets to an end-device, a network user needs to be serviced an OUI. This can be
  their own OUI or one operated by a third party, such as Console operated by Helium Foundation.

- **Proof-of-Coverage (PoC)** - A unique consensus algorithm employed by the LoRaWAN and 5G
  subnetworks, which rewards participants for verifying wireless network coverage.

- [**Proof-of-History (PoH)**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-history-and-how-does-it-work/) -
  A consensus protocol unique to Solana, Proof-of-History is a verifiable and sequential
  timestamping mechanism that provides a trustless and efficient ordering of events in the
  blockchain.

- [**Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-beginners-guide/) -
  A PoS-system is a type of blockchain consensus protocol that achieves verification by selecting
  validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency.

- [**Redundancy**](/iot/coverage-mapping#mappers-visualization): The total count of IoT Hotspots
  that heard a mapper from within this hex. This metric is helpful in understanding the resilience
  of the Network in a given area.

- **Repository** - A storage location that contains all the files, documentation, and version
  history of a project.

- [**RSSI**](/iot/coverage-mapping#mappers-visualization): 'Received Signal Strength Indicator' is a
  measure of the power present in a received radio signal. This number is computed by the IoT
  Hotspot when it hears the signal from a mapper. The higher the signal (less negative), the
  'stronger' it is considered.

- [**SAS**](https://ongoalliance.org/the-technology-behind-spectrum-sharing-the-spectrum-access-system/) -
  SAS or 'Spectrum Access System'. Radios for 5G Hotspots must be registered in the SAS maintained
  by the FCC.

- [**SNR**](/iot/coverage-mapping#mappers-visualization) - 'Signal to Noise Ratio' measures the
  ratio of received power to background power in the received signal. Like the RSSI, it is also
  computed by the IoT Hotspot when it hears signal from the mapper. A higher ratio represents a
  clear signal whereas a negative number in this field represents a noisy signal.

- [**Solana**](https://solana.com) - A blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to
  provide smart contract functionality as well as a mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH), which
  uses hashed timestamps to verify when transactions occur.

- **Locking-Up (or 'Staking')** - The act of temporarily locking up tokens as collateral to
  participate in block validation and consensus mechanisms, earning rewards for supporting network
  operations or generating Voting Power.

- **Token** - Tokens are digital assets that utilize cryptography for secure transactions, represent
  value, and can be used for various purposes within a decentralized network or ecosystem.

- **Validators** - A distributed network actor responsible for verifying and validating transactions
  and blocks, maintaining the network's security and consensus.

- [**veHNT**](/governance/faq#what-is-vehnt) - A position created by locking HNT tokens. Used for
  voting on proposals that affect the entire Helium Network of Networks model.

- [**veIOT**](/governance/voting#veiot) - A position created by locking IOT tokens. Used for IOT
  Network governance.

- [**veMOBILE**](/governance/voting#vemobile) - A position created by locking MOBILE tokens. Used
  for MOBILE Network governance.

- [**Vote-Escrowed ('ve')**](/governance/voting#vote-escrowed-positions-as-nfts) - A position
  created by locking tokens that only functions for Network or subnetwork voting. Vote-escrowed
  positions appear in Helium Wallets as NFTs and are non-transferable.

- [**Voting power**](/governance/voting#voting-power) - Specific network tokens will give voting
  power in the designated Network or subnetworks. Voting power is the token amount multiplied by the
  duration of a lock-up period. Voting power creates a weight of the vote against other veHNT
  owners. 100 veHNT is more than ten veHNT. The higher amount would mean more weight in deciding
  vote outcomes. The more HNT is locked for veHNT, the more voting power a veHNT owner has.

- **Wallet** - A digital application designed for interacting with blockchain-based applications.
  Wallets enable users to store and manage their digital assets, such as digital tokens and NFTs.
