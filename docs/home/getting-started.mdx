# What is Helium?

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/home/helium.png')} />

Helium Network is a decentralized, blockchain-backed wireless network project that leverages LoRaWAN
technology. It incentivizes individuals and organizations to set up and manage wireless networks
through token rewards. Currently, Helium integrates with 5G networks, using the Solana blockchain as
its foundation. The network's primary utility token is HNT, supplemented by IOT and MOBILE tokens
which facilitate the operation of LoRaWAN and 5G networks.

> In essence, the Helium network offers a decentralized, distributed system of Hotspots that
> eliminates the need for traditional internet service providers and centralized authorities that
> monitor your activity and levy costly fees.

By joining the Helium network, you not only gain access to affordable connectivity but also have the
opportunity to be rewarded for participating as a miner on their network. Helium is just trying to
build a better future for the newer generation well watch this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx9YyS7-d3g).

An interesting aspect of Helium is its exemplary use of blockchain technology in real-world
applications as a DePIN project. DePIN, short for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks,
leverages decentralized technology for practical applications such as street mapping, rendering
power, cab-hailing services, and more.

Helium's focus is on enhancing wireless networks through a growing collection of user-owned
hotspots. These hotspots enable communities to improve their internet and cell coverage
independently of traditional telecom companies. Helium employs a unique consensus algorithm known as
Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) in its subnetworks.

On April 18, 2023, Helium transitioned from its independent blockchain network to the Solana
blockchain. Read More about the [Solana Migration](/solana/migration). This significant move
represents one of the largest layer 1 blockchain migrations to date, bolstering the expansion of the
world's largest decentralized wireless network. Helium's migration to Solana could potentially
stimulate growth across the entire DePIN sector.

> As Daly explains, "Helium really represents the first DePIN business that things could be built on
> top of." This is just the beginning. Solana's interoperable ecosystem, coupled with its low costs
> and scalable innovations such as compressed NFTs, could pave the way for new, decentralized,
> community-run infrastructure for businesses and users.

## Helium Network Components

**Solana Blockchain:** The underlying blockchain infrastructure that provides security, scalability,
and decentralization for the Helium Network.

**HNT Token:** The native token of the Helium Network, which is used to incentivize network
participants and facilitate transactions.

**IOT Token:** A token specific to the LoRaWAN network, enabling low-power, wide-area network
connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. PoC is employed for the LoRaWAN subnetwork.

**MOBILE Token:** A token specific to the 5G network, facilitating high-speed mobile connectivity
and data transmission. PoC is employed for the 5G subnetwork.

Through these components, the Helium Network is revolutionizing the network industry in web3 using
solana blockchain.

## Network Participants

**Hotspot Owners:** Individuals or organizations that deploy and maintain Helium-compatible wireless
devices (Hotspots) to provide network coverage.

**IoT Device Owners:** Users of IoT devices that leverage the Helium Network for connectivity.

**Mobile Device Users:** Users of mobile devices that access the 5G network through the Helium
Network infrastructure.

**Developers:** Individuals or organizations that build applications and services using the Helium
Network infrastructure.

## Key Features

**Decentralized Infrastructure:** The Helium Network allows for the creation and maintenance of a
distributed wireless network by incentivizing participants to contribute resources and share the
benefits.

**Scalable and Secure:** The Helium Network leverages the Solana Blockchain, which is known for its
high scalability, low latency, and robust security.

**Multi-Use Case Support:** The Helium Network supports various use cases, including IoT devices
through the LoRaWAN network and high-speed mobile connectivity via the 5G network.

**Incentivized Participation:** The Helium Network employs a token-based system to reward
participants and encourage network growth.

**Proof-of-Coverage (PoC):** A unique consensus algorithm employed by the LoRaWAN and 5G
subnetworks, which rewards participants for verifying wireless network coverage.
