The Helium Network powers two distinct wireless networks; a global LoRaWAN&trade; network for IoT
devices, and a cellular offload Wi-Fi network for mobile connectivity. Wireless gateways called
"Hotspots", operated by the Helium community, provide the coverage for these networks. Hotspot
owners are incentivized with the Helium HNT token for providing coverage and handling wireless
traffic.
