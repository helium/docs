Before migrating from the Helium blockchain to Solana, Hotspot Makers had to fund Maker wallets with
enough Data Credits to facilitate two separate transactions: The 4,000,000 DC cost of onboarding
each Hotspot, and The 1,000,000 DC cost of the first location assertion for each Hotspot. Onboarding
fees are paid once. Location assertion fees are paid each time the Hotspot location is updated.

This funding of the Data Credits was done by burning HNT from the Makers wallet to Data Credits in
the Makers wallet using a CLI tool which is no longer supported. Transaction costs were charged in
DC and paid for by DC or implicitly burning HNT to DC in the Makers' wallets.

## Funding Maker Account on Solana

Funding a Maker wallet with Data Credits from HNT tokens is now performed in the Helium Wallet App.
The transaction costs for onboarding and location assertion are paid in SOL to the Solana
Blockchain. Maker wallets must now maintain token balances of both Data Credits and SOL for
onboarding and location assertion fees which the Maker supplies to customers.

### Data Credit Fees

- Onboarding = 4,000,000 DC
- Location Assertion = 1,000,000 DC<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup>

[^1]:
    Currently 500,000 due to
    [HIP 69](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0069-reassertion-fee-reduction.md).

### SOL Fees

- Create the Hotspot NFT on the blockchain = 0.00001 SOL
- Onboard only or Onboard and Location Assertion = 0.00175696
- SOL Location Assertion only = 0.00001 SOL

## Funding Maker Wallets with SOL

Funding a Maker wallet with SOL is performed the same way as sending tokens to any crypto wallet.
Send from an exchange, another wallet, or swap from another cryptocurrency within the Helium Wallet
using the inbuilt browser and a swap aggregator such as [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap).

## Funding Maker Wallets with Data Credits

Funding a wallet with Data Credits requires HNT, as Data Credits can only be obtained using HNT. The
exchange rate for DC is $1 worth of HNT = 100,000 DC.

- If HNT is $2 then 0.5 HNT = 100,000 DC
- If HNT is $10 then 0.1 HNT = 100,000 DC

The USD/HNT exchange rate within the Helium Wallet App is used for the conversion and appears in the
Helium Wallet app before committing the transaction.

:::warning HNT to DC swaps are irreversible

Data Credits cannot be refunded, exchanged for other tokens, or transferred between wallets.

:::

### Method 1: Use the Helium Wallet app

Makers can use the Helium Wallet app to swap HNT directly to DC.

This method requires that the Maker Wallet is already funded with HNT to swap and SOL for
transaction fees.

Swap HNT to DC within a Maker Wallet:

1. Select the Maker Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned for DC within the same Wallet.

The new DC balance amount can be verified in the app tokens list on the `$` tab within the Helium
Wallet app.

### Method 2 : Use the Helium Wallet app to Fund a Different Wallet

Any Wallet owner can send DC to a Maker wallet using the Helium Wallet app to swap HNT directly to
DC.

This method requires that the sending Wallet is already funded with HNT to swap and SOL for
transaction fees.

Add the Maker Wallet address to the Address Book:

1. Tap the `Address Book` icon in the top right corner of the Helium Wallet app.
1. Add new contact with the Maker's Solana wallet address.

Swap HNT to DC to a Maker Wallet:

1. Select any Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. Tap the grey `Add Recipient +` text to enter the receiving Solana wallet address.
1. Tap the `...` to the right of Solana Address and select the contact for the Maker Wallet.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned for DC within the same Wallet.

The new DC balance amount in the recipient Maker Wallet can be verified by looking at the Helium
Data Credit token balance of the maker wallet on https://explorer.solana.com/
