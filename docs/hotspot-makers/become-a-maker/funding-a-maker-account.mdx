Prior to migrating from the Helium blockchain to Solana, Hotspot makers were required to fund their
maker wallets with enough Data Credits to facilitate two separate transactions: the 4,000,000 DC
cost of onboarding each Hotspot and the 1,000,000 DC cost of the first location assertion for each
Hotspot. Onboarding is only paid once, location assertion is paid each time the Hotspot changes
location

This funding of the Data Credits was done by burning HNT from the makers wallet to DC in the makers
wallet using a CLI tool which is no longer supported. Transaction costs were charged in DC and paid
for by DC or autoburning HNT to DC in the wallet.

## Funding the Maker account on the Solana blockchain

With the migration of the Helium blockchain to the Solana blockchain, funding the wallet with Data
Credits from HNT tokens is now completed by using the Helium Wallet App directly. New to Solana, the
transaction costs for onboarding and location assertion are paid in SOL to the Solana Blockchain.
Maker wallets must now maintain token balances of both Data Credits and SOL to be able to onboard
and location assert the Hotspots that the maker is supplying to customers.

### Onboarding Hotspots - Data Credit fees

Onboarding the Hotspot = 4,000,000 DC Location assert the Hotspot = 1,000,000 DC - currently 500,000
due to HIP 69

### Onboarding Hotspots - SOL token fees

Create the Hotspot NFT on the blockchain = 0.00001 SOL Onboard only or Onboard and Location assert
the Hotspot = 0.00175696 SOL Location assert only the Hotspot = 0.00001 SOL

### Funding the wallet with SOL

Funding the wallet with SOL is performed the same way as sending crypto currency tokens to any
crypto wallet. Send from an exchange, another wallet or swap from another cryptocurrency within the
Helium Wallet using the inbuilt browser and a swap aggregator such as https://jup.ag/swap

### Funding the wallet with Data Credits

Funding a wallet with Data Credits requires HNT and only HNT can be used to obtain data credits. The
exchange rate for DC is $1 worth of HNT = 100,000 DC.

- If HNT is $2 then 0.5 HNT = 100,000 DC
- If HNT is $10 then 0.1 HNT = 100,000 DC

It is the USD/HNT exchange rate within the Helium Wallet App that is used for the conversion. This
is shown before committing the transaction.

## Method 1 : Using the wallet app to swap HNT to DC within the Maker Wallet

This requires HNT held within the maker wallet and access to the maker wallet. For migrating a
Helium based wallet to Solana, please use this widget.

- Using the Helium Wallet app with the makers' Wallet selected.
- Click the $ Icon and if shown,slide the token list down until the Deposit, Swap and Send buttons
  are shown.
- Take note of the total HNT in the wallet.
- Click the Swap icon. Accept any warning.
- Select first token as HNT and second token as DC
- Enter a value in the “You Pay x HNT” entry, that is the same as, less than or the “max” of the HNT
  in the wallet.
- Check the You Receive amount is showing a value appropriate for the exchange rate in the app and
  press the Swap Tokens button.
- Confirm this is irreversible
- HNT is burned for DC within the same wallet.
- The new DC balance amount can be verified in the app tokens list.

## Method 2 : Using the wallet app to swap HNT to DC and send it to the Maker wallet from any other wallet

This method requires HNT held within any wallet and the maker's Solana wallet address. For migrating
a Helium based wallet to Solana, please use this widget.

- Using the Helium Wallet app click the Address Book icon in the top right corner.
- Add new contact with the maker's Solana wallet address.
- Click the $ Icon and if shown, slide the token list down until the Deposit, Swap and Send buttons
  are shown.
- Take note of the total HNT in the wallet.
- Click the Swap icon. Accept any warning.
- Select first token as HNT and second token as DC
- Enter a value in the “You Pay x HNT” entry, that is the amount of HNT in the wallet you want to
  exchange for DC.
- Click the "Add Recipient +"
- Click the "..." to the right of Solana Address and select the Contact you created
- Check the You Receive amount is showing a value appropriate for the exchange rate in the app and
  press the Swap Tokens button.
- Confirm this is irreversible
- HNT is burned for DC and the DC deposited in the recipients wallet
- The new DC balance amount in the recipients wallet can be verified by looking at the Helium Data
  Credit token balance of the maker wallet on https://explorer.solana.com/

## Warning

Data Credits cannot be refunded, exchanged for other tokens or transferred between wallets.
