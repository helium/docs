# FAQ - Approved Hotspot Manufacturers

Nova Labs (formerly Helium Systems, Inc.) manufactured the first set of Hotspots on the Network.
(These are often referred to as "OGs."). Nova Labs no longer manufacturers Hotspots, but there is
now an extensive list of approved manufacturers (known in the community as "Makers")

<!-- TODO: section in docs for Manufacturing topics - migrate from google docs and notion -->

<!-- TODO: links to ethics docs -->

- All approved Hotspots can be found [here](/mine-hnt).

<!-- TODO: check this link 👆, likely in notion, should pull into docs -->

<!-- TODO: every product is approved, not every Maker -->

<!-- TODO: merge man docs with maker apps list -->

<!-- TODO: merge manufacturer docs with maker apps list -->

:::caution Be Careful

Please be very careful if purchasing a Helium Hotspot from a non-authorized seller. Hotspots can be
transferred from one Helium Wallet to another. Once they are added to the blockchain, only the
owning wallet can transfer it to another. Any transfers are solely between the two entities ("Buyer"
and "Seller"), and Helium is not involved.
