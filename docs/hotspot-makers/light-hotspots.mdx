# Light Hotspots Software Upgrade [Updated]

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

This document describes the architecture and technical roadmap planned for converting existing
Approved Hotspots to formerly called "Light Hotspots", now just called "Hotspots" as a software upgrade; updated with HIP70 in mind.

The conclusion of the ~~Light~~ Hotspot project has completed. **Last updated Friday April 20,
2023**.

## What is a ~~Light~~ Hotspot? [History]

Light Hotspots are the evolution of how LoRaWAN gateways interact with the Helium blockchain.
Since the genesis block, the Helium blockchain has run entirely on the physical Hotspot itself. As
the blockchain network grows, each Hotspot running a full node undergoes increasing load and are
starting to fall out of sync due to the higher compute requirements.

Before the introduction of [HIP 70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md),
the goal was to move Challenge creation and Consensus work to Validators. 

## What is a ~~Light~~ Hotspot? [Now updated April 24, 2023]

Since HIP-70 and the
introduction of Off-Chain PoC Oracles, the definition of ~~Light~~ Hotspot and what it will do has
changed. Please read on for detailed changes and timelines.

## ~~Light~~ Hotspot Properties

The ~~Light~~ Hotspot software is fully developed and in production, satisfying the
following properties:

- A Hotspot on the Helium network will Beacon (also known as emitting a challenge for
  Proof-of-Coverage) automatically on a pre-determined time interval (up to several times a day);
- Will submit PoC receipts directly to an Off-Chain PoC Oracle;
- Does not store a copy of the Blockchain, eliminating synchronization;
- Will transmit packets on behalf of IoT devices on the network to an Off-Chain Data Oracle;
- Does not participate in Consensus Groups;
- Will no longer depend on libp2p or "gossip", and instead use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a new
  framework to communicate between distributed systems;
- Will be eligible to earn $HNT (see table below)

In other words, Hotspot software will allow the Hotspot to participate as a
[Full Hotspot](/mine-hnt/full-hotspots), without the extra overhead of maintaining a local copy of
the blockchain.

## Architecture

This image shows the progression to ~~Light~~ Hotspots, with the role of Miner being deprecated as 
the blockchain is moved off the Hotspots and Proof-of-Coverage receipts are moved to an Oracle. At the conclusion
of ~~Light~~ Hotspot development in April 2023, the entire Helium blockchain has been removed from Hotspots. Hotspots
now Beacon on their own without external input, and all data transfer and Proof-of-Coverage
receipts have moved to Off-Chain Oracles.

### HIP-70 Changes

[HIP-70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/471)has passed.
HIP-70 proposes a new architecture that involves several Oracles that allow Proof-of-Coverage
generation to be automated and its receipts to be off-chain. The most "expensive" piece of
Proof-of-Coverage is not just Challenge creation, but Receipt validation and verification. By taking
these tasks off-chain, PoC frequency can increase dramatically, up to several times a day. Hotspot
owners can expect more reliable challenges and witnessing.

The core team has completed work on these Oracles which are used for both IoT and Mobile. 

Roughly speaking, a Hotspot will Beacon on its own,
with neighboring Hotspots witnessing and submitting their receipts to an **Ingestor** Oracle. 
The **Packet Verifier** gets its data from the packet router (IoT) or the cellular backend (Mobile).

The **Ingestor** uploads receipts into a cloud store where another Oracle, called a **Verifier**
takes input from both the **Ingestor** and the **Packet Verifier**. 

The **Ingestor** and the **Packet Verifier** filter out invalid receipts and produce the reward output. 
The output of the **Verifier** is passed to a
**Reward** Oracle that determines how much reward shares a Hotspot should earn for that period.
Finally, Hotspots are rewarded for their work in Proof-of-Coverage.
***

For this to happen, two blockchain-related pieces must complete:

1. The launch of the IOT Subnetwork as described in
   [HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md)
2. The passing of HIP-70 and the completed transition to a new L1

To avoid further delays, the core team believes the work for Off-Chain PoC has progressed enough to
allow an intermediate step that allows Hotspots to remove the Erlang miner, have Hotspots beacon at
a more frequent interval, and remove PoC off chain.

Hotspot completion is at the **Reward** Oracle step. Instead of the
**Verifier** submitting its Proof-of-Coverage results to the Reward Oracle, all Proof-of-Coverage
receipts will be signed and submitted to the Helium L1 Blockchain where rewards will be paid out in
HNT (as they are today) by a new Oracle called the Injector. This removes the need for the IOT
Subnetwork to exist and removes the dependency of the L1 switchover.

## Code and Development

The bulk of the code that enables Hotspots on actual LoRaWAN gateways is called
[gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs). It's easiest to think of this as Helium's
next-generation packet forwarder.

Development of this code takes place in the above GitHub repo, as well at the
`#gateway-developement` channel on the [Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium).

Oracle work can be found at the [Oracles](https://github.com/helium/oracles) repository.

# Development Timelines

- **March 18 2021**: Data Only Hotspots routes free packets
- **July 20 2021**: Data Only Hotspots activated on Helium Network (appears on chain)
- **October 11 2021**: Data Only Hotspots mine HNT
- **January 2022**: Hardware Audit starts for Light Hotspot manufacturers
- **February 2022**: Introduce hardware-based Hotspots on Testnet (Full Hotspots running Light
  Hotspot firmware).
- **February 22 2022**:
  [HIP 54](https://heliumvote.com/14me3X7jpEmn3eeFfnAkMvUoFU3cN6GAS3CDomqCikr7VQfHWrU) and
  [HIP 55](https://heliumvote.com/14Rjhhz1DXLVmSRdzappqWgD6rfgu6XYxmdaSCvWLyLH8ZWbciK) passes
- **February 2022**: HIP-19 Approved Makers participating in Testnet
- **~~April 6 2022~~** **April 13**: Code related to Light Hotspot merged to production, in an
  inactive state. Light Hotspot software update tagged for Makers to upgrade their fleet.
- **~~April 19 2022~~** **May 11**: Activate set of chain variables to enable Light Hotspots on
  Mainnet
- **September 2022**:
- Introduction of HIP-70, Off-Chain Oracles, and Hotspots transferring data, and Challenging more
  reliably
- Continuing Oracle Work and beta `gateway-rs` builds to allow Hotspots to Beacon on a regular
  interval and send its receipts to a Devnet Oracle for further receipt processing
- **~November 2022**: Should HIP-70 pass, the completion of Light Hotspots with the launch of PoC
  Oracles, Data Transfer Oracles, and a final `gateway-rs` build to remove the Erlang miner
- **~October 2022**: HIP-70 passed
- **~April 2023**: Light Hotspots are completed and the decision is made to call Light Hotspots simply Hotspots.*

*With the completion of moving from Miner to Gateway-rs, we've simplified hotspots by removing the terms “Full” and “Light”. All hotspots will be called “hotspots” and "data only hotspots". MOBILE network has one or more "radios" which is attached to a "hotspot", or (future) a single "radio" which is attached to a "Mobile WiFi hotspot"
