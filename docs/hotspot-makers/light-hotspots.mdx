# Light Hotspots Software Upgrade [Updated]

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

This document describes the architecture and technical roadmap planned for converting existing
Approved Hotspots to Light Hotspots as a software upgrade; updated with HIP70 in mind, should it
pass.

The conclusion of the Light Hotspot project is in progress. **Last updated Friday September 16,
2022**.

## What is a Light Hotspot? [Updated]

Light Hotspots are the evolution of how LoRaWAN gateways will interact with the Helium blockchain.
Since the genesis block, the Helium blockchain has run entirely on the physical Hotspot itself. As
the blockchain network grows, each Hotspot running a full node undergoes increasing load and are
starting to fall out of sync due to the higher compute requirements.

Before the introduction of [HIP 70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md),
the goal was to move Challenge creation and Consensus work to Validators. Since HIP-70 and the
introduction of Off-Chain PoC Oracles, the definition of Light Hotspot and what it will do has
changed. Please read on for detailed changes and timelines.

## Light Hotspot Properties [Updated]

When the Light Hotspot software is fully developed and in production, they will satisfy the
following properties:

- A Hotspot on the Helium network will Beacon (also known as emitting a challenge for
  Proof-of-Coverage) automatically on a pre-determined time interval (up to several times a day);
- Will submit PoC receipts directly to an Off-Chain PoC Oracle;
- Does not store a copy of the Blockchain, eliminating synchronization;
- Will transmit packets on behalf of IoT devices on the network to an Off-Chain Data Oracle;
- Does not participate in Consensus Groups;
- Will no longer depend on libp2p or "gossip", and instead use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a new
  framework to communicate between distributed systems;
- Will be eligible to earn $HNT (see table below)

In other words, the Light Hotspot software will allow the Hotspot to participate as a
[Full Hotspot](/mine-hnt/full-hotspots), without the extra overhead of maintaining a local copy of
the blockchain.

## Architecture

This image shows the progression to Light Hotspots, with the role of Miner being deprecated as we
move the blockchain off the Hotspots and Proof-of-Coverage receipts to an Oracle. At the conclusion
of Light Hotspot development, the entire Helium blockchain will be removed from Hotspots, Hotspots
will Beacon on their own without external input, and all data transfer and Proof-of-Coverage
receipts will go to Off-Chain Oracles.

### HIP-70 Changes

HIP-70 proposes a new architecture that involves several Oracles that allow Proof-of-Coverage
generation to be automated and its receipts to be off-chain. The most "expensive" piece of
Proof-of-Coverage is not just Challenge creation, but Receipt validation and verification. By taking
these tasks off-chain, PoC frequency can increase dramatically, up to several times a day. Hotspot
owners can expect more reliable challenges and witnessing.

The core team has started work on these Oracles. Roughly speaking, a Hotspot will Beacon on its own,
with neighboring Hotspots witnessing and submitting their receipts to an **Ingestor** Oracle. The
**Ingestor\*\*** uploads receipts into a cloud store where another Oracle, called a **Verifier**
runs through the files to filter out invalid receipts. The output of the **Verifier** is passed to a
**Reward** Oracle that determines how much reward shares a Hotspot should earn for that period.
Finally, Hotspots are rewarded for their work in Proof-of-Coverage.

For this to happen, two blockchain-related pieces must complete:

1. The launch of the IOT Subnetwork as described in
   [HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md)
2. The passing of HIP-70 and the completed transition to a new L1

To avoid further delays, the core team believes the work for Off-Chain PoC has progressed enough to
allow an intermediate step that allows Hotspots to remove the Erlang miner, have Hotspots beacon at
a more frequent interval, and remove PoC off chain.

The change to complete Light Hotspot will be at the **Reward** Oracle step. Instead of the
**Verifier** submitting its Proof-of-Coverage results to the Reward Oracle, all Proof-of-Coverage
receipts will be signed and submitted to the Helium L1 Blockchain where rewards will be paid out in
HNT (as they are today) by a new Oracle called the Injector. This removes the need for the IOT
Subnetwork to exist and removes the dependency of the L1 switchover.

## Code and Development

The bulk of the code that enables Light Hotspots on actual LoRaWAN gateways is called
[gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs). It's easiest to think of this as Helium's
next-generation packet forwarder.

Development of this code takes place in the above GitHub repo, as well at the
`#gateway-developement` channel on the [Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium).

Oracle work can be found at the [Oracles](https://github.com/helium/oracles) repository.

# Development Timelines
