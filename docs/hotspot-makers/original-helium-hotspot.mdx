Nova Labs (formerly Helium Systems, Inc.) manufactured the first set of Hotspots on the Network.
(These are often referred to as "OGs."). Nova Labs no longer manufacturers Hotspots, but there is
now an extensive list of approved manufacturers (known in the community as "Makers")

## Helium Hotspot App Overview

The Helium Hotspot App previously focused on people who want to send or receive HNT or manage
Hotspots. other activities, such as managing end-devices and OUIs (i.e. users of the network) are
generally best suited for the command line wallet.

It currently is specifically for managing **only Helium Branded Hotspots**.

The Helium app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hotspot/id1450463605) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet)) includes everything
needed to on-board and maintain an Original Helium Hotspot and view its activity. With the app you
are able to do things like:
