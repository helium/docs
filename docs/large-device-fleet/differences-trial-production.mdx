# Differences in a trial vs production

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

It is recommended to run a small trial to get comfortable with the network and to understand performance of devices. The length of the trial will depend on the questions you are trying to answer for yourself (does this device work, can I make decisions with data from this device, how often should my device transmit, do I have enough coverage, etc.).

Production is not just a larger trial. There are additional considerations that will become important to take care of in production that you were not necessarily considering during the trial.

* **Robustness** - for devices, hotspots, and the router. What happens if one of these goes down? How quickly can you detect the problem? How quickly can you resolve it?
* **Managing devices in the field** - when you have a small number of devices to manage during the trial, it is not very expensive to visit them and replace them when they fail in the field. It is also not as important to fix them quickly once they stop working as it is only a trial. How do you plan to manage a large number of devices that may fail in the field? How quickly can you send someone out to find and fix a failed device?
* **Additional security requirements** - While it is not a security risk, most larger organisations would benefit from owning their own router as it allows them for more configuration and control over their devices and data flows.
