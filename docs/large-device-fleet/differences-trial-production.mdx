# Differences in a trial vs production

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Before deploying a large flee of devices, it is recommended to run a small trial
to get comfortable with the Helium network and to understand performance of your
devices. The length of the trial will depend on the questions you are trying to
answer for yourself (does this device work, can I make decisions with data from
this device, how often should my device transmit, do I have enough coverage,
etc.).

Production is not just a larger trial. There are additional aspects that will
become important to take care of in production that you were not necessarily
considering during the trial.

- **Robustness** - for devices, hotspots, and the router. What happens if one of
  these goes down? How quickly can you detect the problem? How quickly can you
  resolve it?
- **Managing devices in the field** - when you have a small number of devices to
  manage during the trial, it is not very expensive to visit them and replace
  them when they fail in the field. It is also not as important to fix them
  quickly once they stop working as it is only a trial. How do you plan to
  manage a large number of devices that may fail in the field? How quickly can
  you send someone out to find and fix a failed device?
- **Additional security requirements** - Does your organization have increased
  security requirements? You may benefit from running your own Router/LoRaWAN
  Network Server. This ensures that when device data gets decrypted (in the
  Router), it does so in your own environment. Devices transmit data in
  encrypted form, and hotspots are unable to decode the payload of packets they
  receive. Data can only be decrypted on the Router.
