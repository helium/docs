## Basic pricing
100,000 data credits (DC) for $1

1 packet with a payload of up to 24 bytes = 1 DC

payload:
* 25-48 bytes = 2 DC 
* 49-72 bytes = 3 DC
* and so on ...


Total device packet usage will consist of data and network packets. 
Data packets are equivalent to 24 bytes of payload. If your device transmits more than 24 bytes at a time,
divide the payload size and that is how many packets you will be paying for. 50 byte payload will count as
3 packets (24 +24 + 2 bytes). Command packets consist of network packets related to managing your device’s
connection to the network. This is sent by the network in the background. It may vary anywhere between 
2-10% extra packets on top of your existing data packets.

The following expenses are only needed if you are planning to have a large number of devices, have specific
needs to control your network and you have specific security requirements.
* **Router** - This is your own LoRaWAN server on the Helium network. Your devices’ packets will be delivered directly to your LoRaWAN server (router) from the hotspots that picked up your devices’ transmissions.
* **OUI** - This is required to route your devices’ packets to your own LoRaWAN server/Router. $100
* **DevAddr slab** - You need to get your own range of addresses on the LoRaWAN network to help hotspot figure out where to deliver your packets. DevAddr is used by the Helium network to figure out who owns the device. The cost is $100 per DevAddr. The minimum purchase is a block of 8 DevAddr, therefore $800. You can buy blocks in multiples of 2 (8, 16, 32, …).
* **Adding devices to the network** - Every time you add devices to the Helium network, you have to pay for the transaction cost of that action. To minimise these costs, you can add devices in large batches as it is the cost of the transaction that you are paying for, not the number of devices processed. 40,000 per transaction
* **Billing reconciliation with hotspots** - Sending money on the blockchain is not free. Because of that, we cannot pay each hotspot for the packet they deliver instantly. To lower the cost of paying hotspots for the data they provide is called “maintaining state channels.” This is equivalent to keeping a running total of who owes whom and reconciling it infrequently. By doing the money transfer only infrequently, transaction fees are lowered. 35,000 DC to open/close a state channel.
You need to have at least one channel open to receive packets. Due to this, you will have two channels running, with staggered start times, so that one of them is always up and funded with data credits.

## Example calculation for operating a large number of devices

Assumptions used for the calculation:
* Devices: 100,000
* Transmits per day: 2x
* State Channels open for: 7 days
* Devices added: once per week

Costs:
* Upfront = OUI + 8 DevAddr = 1,000,000 + 8 * 1,000,000 = 9,000,000
* Adding devices = 52 x 40,000 = 2,080,000 DC
* Transmissions = 100,000 * 2 * 52 * 1.10 = 11,440,000 DC
(Adding conservative 10% to the number of packets due to underlying network commands that are required as part of the LoRaWAN network management)
* State channel management = 52 * 2 * 35,000 = 3,640,000 DC
* Cost of running and managing a Router = varies ($1,000+ per month)

| Upfont or Yearly Costs  | Description                    | Data Credits | Dollars |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------|:--------|
|Upfront                  |OUI + 8 DevAddr                 | 1,000,000 + 8 * 1,000,000 = 9,000,000| $900|
|Upfront                  |New devices                     |52 x 40,000 = 2,080,000| $200|
|Yearly                   |Transmissions                   |100,000 * 2 * 52 * 1.10 = 11,440,000| $114.40|
|Yearly                   |Billing reconciliation   |52 * 2 * 35,000 = 3,640,000|$36.40|
