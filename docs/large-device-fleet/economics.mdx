## Basic pricing

100,000 data credits for $1

1 packet payload = 1 data credit (DC)

**Payload size**:

- 1-24 bytes = 1 DC
- 25-48 bytes = 2 DC
- 49-72 bytes = 3 DC
- and so on ...

### Total device packet usage = data packets + network management packets

**Data** packets carry payload between your device and your system (application
server).

**Network management** packets are sent by the Router/LoRaWAN Network Server in
the course of managing your device’s connection to the network. This may add
anywhere from 2-10% extra packets on top of your existing data packets.

The following expenses are only needed if you are planning to have a large
number of devices, have specific needs to control your network and/or you have
specific security requirements:

- **Router** - This is your own LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) on the Helium
  network. Your devices’ packets will be delivered directly to your Router/LNS
  from the hotspots that picked up your device’s transmissions.
- **OUI** - This is required in order to route your devices’ packets to your own
  Router/LNS. This is purchased directly from Helium for $100.
- **DevAddr slab** - You need to get your own DevAddr range of addresses when
  you purchase an OUI. DevAddr is used by the Helium network to figure out who
  owns the device and where the packet should be delivered. The cost is $100 per
  DevAddr. The minimum purchase is a block of 8 DevAddr, therefore $800. You can
  buy blocks in multiples of 2 (8, 16, 32, …).
- **Adding devices to the network** - Every time you add devices to the Helium
  network, you have to pay for the cost of that transaction. To minimise these
  costs, you can add devices in large batches as it is the cost of the
  transaction that you are paying for, not the number of devices processed.
  The cost is $0.40 per transaction.
- **Billing reconciliation with hotspots** - Sending money between the accounts
  on the blockchain has a cost. Because of that, we cannot pay hotspots
  instantly for each packet they deliver. To lower the cost of paying hotspots
  for the packets they deliver, we have to do what is called “maintaining state
  channels.” This is equivalent to keeping a running total of who owes whom, and
  reconciling it every few hours or days. By paying hotspots infrequently,
  overall transaction fees are kept low. It costs $0.35 to open/close a state
  channel. There needs to be least one channel open to receive packets. Due to
  this, it is best to have two state channels open at a time, with staggered
  start times. This way, at any time there is at least one satte channel open
  ready to receive packets and account for them.

### Example calculation for operating a large number of devices

Assumptions used for the calculation:

- Devices: 100,000
- Transmits per day: 2
- State Channels open for: 7 days
- Devices added: once per week

Costs:

- Upfront = OUI + 8 DevAddr = 10,000,000 + 8 x 10,000,000 = 90,000,000
- Adding devices = 52 x 40,000 = 2,080,000 DC
- Transmissions = 100,000 x 2 x 52 x 1.10 = 11,440,000 DC (Adding conservative
  10% to the number of packets due to underlying network commands that are
  required as part of the LoRaWAN network management)
- State channel management = 52 x 2 x 35,000 = 3,640,000 DC
- Cost of running and managing a Router = varies ($1,000+ per month)
