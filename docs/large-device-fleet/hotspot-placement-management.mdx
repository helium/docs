# Hotspot placement and management

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Different scenarios:
* **Office** - can be covered by a single hotspot without needing to think about radio waves
* **Building/large site** - can be covered with a few hotspots with minor consideration of radio wave propagation
* **Large geographic area** - requires a number of hotspots installed on poles, roofs, buildings or towers. High understanding of radio wave propagation is required.

Specialised software for managing multiple hotspots is very handy when your business depends on all your hotspots operating perfectly. Perform a web search on available hotspot management tools as new offerings keep coming up.
