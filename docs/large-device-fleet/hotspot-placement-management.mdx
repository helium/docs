# Hotspot placement and management

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Hotspot placement will primarily depend on where your devices are.

Different scenarios:

- **Office** - can be covered by a single hotspot without needing to think about
  radio waves
- **Building/large site** - can be covered with a few hotspots with minor
  consideration of radio wave propagation
- **Large geographic area** - requires a number of hotspots installed on poles,
  roofs, buildings or towers. High understanding of radio wave propagation is
  required.

Capacity of hotspots is very large as they listen on eight different channels
and LoRaWAN transmissions are very quick. One hotspot can easily handle tens of
thousands of devices, depending how frequently they are transmitting.

Specialised software for managing multiple hotspots is very handy when your
business depends on all your hotspots operating perfectly. Perform a web search
for hotspot management tools to get the latest available tools as new offerings
keep coming up.
