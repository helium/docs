# Operating your own instance of Router/LoRaWAN Network Server

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

There are two different ways to have your own Router/LoRaWAN Network Server
(LNS):

- Run the server yourself - detailed instructions will be available online, or
- Find someone in the ecosystem whose business is to host Routers for others. 
They will save you a lot of time by standing up and operating an instance of 
a Router just for you.

Router software to run on your own server:

- Helium's version of [Router](https://github.com/helium/router)
- Vendor-provided version that is compatible with Helium. Enquire with your
  preferred LoRaWAN Network Server provider for the latest in their
  compatibility with the Helium network.
