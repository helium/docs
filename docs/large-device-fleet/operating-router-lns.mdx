# Operating your own instance of Router/LoRaWAN Network Server

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

There are two different ways to have your own Router/LoRaWAN Network Server
(LNS):

- Run the server yourself, or
- Get someone else to run and maintain the server for you This is a full LoRaWAN
  Network server but you donâ€™t need to know much about LoRaWAN to run one. Being
  knowledgeable about LoRaWAN will make it easier to operate and troubleshoot
  the operation of the server and devices.

Router software to run on your own server:

- Helium's version of [Router](https://github.com/helium/router)
- Vendor-provided version that is compatible with Helium. Enquire with your
  preferred LoRaWAN Network Server provider for the latest in their
  compatibility with the Helium network.
