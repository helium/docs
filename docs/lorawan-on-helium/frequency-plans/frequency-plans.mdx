# Frequencies on the Helium Network

Helium's LoRaWAN Network is built upon 8-channel gateways. This page will help you confirm the
appropriate frequencies for gateway configuration for each country.

Feel free to use
[our packet forwarder configuration examples](https://github.com/helium/sx1302_hal/tree/helium/hotspot/packet_forwarder)
here.

:::warning

LoRa gateways on the Helium Network must transmit on uplink frequencies. Some gateways limit their
transmit range to downlink frequencies and special configuration may be necessary.
