# LoRaWAN On Helium

The LoRaWAN Network on Helium is **compatible with all LoRaWAN devices**.
However, Helium distinguishes itself in how it treats the LoRaWAN Network Server
(LNS).

In typical LoRaWAN Networks, a central or regional LNS is managed by a single
entity. Helium’s design for a decentralized network, however, means not only do
we want gateways (or what we sometimes call Hotspots) to be independently owned
and operated, but we want to enable the independent operation of the LNS.
Without this, access to the network would require permission from a single
central entity, the LNS operator of the network.

Therefore, we want to enable the _multi-tenancy_ of LNS’s on the same Public
LoRaWAN Network. Achieving this distinguishes Helium’s LoRaWAN Network from any
other: public wireless infrastructure is now compatible with privately-run
network servers.

The rest of this article will discuss the networking primitives. If you want to
go ahead and run a network server, please checkout our article about [running
a network server](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server).

## The OUI

Each LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) on the Helium Network acquires an
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). This registers the LNS with the
blockchain and allocates two very important routing objects owned and maintained
by the OUI operator:

- up to five **filters**, describing the sets (AppEUI, DevEUI) expected by the
  LNS
- one or more **slabs** of DevAddrs, reserving NwkAddr space for the OUI's
  devices on the Helium Network

A device defined by (AppEui, DevEui) can be allocated any of the DevAddrs owned
by the OUI. It is even possible to multiplex many devices on the same DevAddr
at the same time, using the Message Integrity Check (MIC) to disambiguate.

### Join Request Frames and Filters

A Join Request frame has the following unencrypted header:

```bash
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|   Size (octets)  |      8     |      8     |      8     |
+------------------+------------+------------+------------+
|   Join Request   |   AppEUI   |   DevEUI   |  DevNonce  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

From the gateways perspective, the (AppEUI, DevEUI) may be used to figure out if
one or more OUI's are interested in the Join Request.

This is done by querying every filter maintained and written to the blockchain
by every OUI. The filters themselves are _xorhash_ tables, thus the AppEui and
DevEui cannot be extracted. Only with the AppEui and DevEui in-hand can the
gateway run it through the table and to see if it's there.

In response to the Join Request, a Join Accept is sent down, assigning the
NwkAddr. Due to the multi-tenancy on the Helium Network, the LNS may only assign
NwkAddrs within its DevAddr slab(s).

### Data Frames and DevAddr Slabs

Data packets have the followed unencrypted header (FHDR):

```bash
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Size (octets)  |     4      |      1     |      2     |    0..15   |
+------------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|   FHDR           |  DevAddr   |    FCtrl   |     FCnt   |    FOpts   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Within DevAddr, there is the NwkAddr of a device:

```bash
+------------------------------------------------+
|                     DevAddr                    |
+------------------------+-----------------------+
|   NwkID (bits 31–25)   |  NwkAddr (bits 24–0)  |
+-----------+--------------------+---------------+
|     Helium Network     |   allocated by slab   | 
|(‘H’ / 0b1001000 / 0x48)|      to OUIs          |
+-----------+--------------------+---------------+
```


From the gateways perspective, it is able to use DevAddr to determine the OUI of
Data frames. A quick query can say which OUI owns this DevAddr slab. This look-up and routing by DevAddr instead of by \(AppEUI, DevEUI\) via _xorhash_
filters is generally much quicker.
