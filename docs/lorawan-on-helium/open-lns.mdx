The Open LNS initiative allows anyone looking to deploy devices on the Helium Network to use any
LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS). The LNS you choose must compile with the LoRaWAN specification to
access the Helium Network.

## Why Open LNS?

Open LNS will deliver the following network improvements:

1. Increased accessibility
2. Accelerated device joins and a focus on increased speed
3. Increased reliability
4. Enabling massive scalability

## Console & LNS Migration

The Open LNS Initiative is unaffected by the migration to Solana. LNS Operators and Console Users
will have months to migrate their LNS services.
