# IOT Proof of Coverage Roadmap

The Helium “IOT” network is the original and largest sub-network in the Helium
system. It uses the LoRaWAN protocol to provide Internet connectivity to a
class of devices that are often described as “the Internet of Things” (IOT).

Proof-of-Coverage is the novel work algorithm that the Helium IOT network uses
to reward Hotspot owners for providing useful coverage for the network.
Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) is designed to incentivize Hotspot owners to deploy Hotspots in underserved areas and report their deployments accurately so that
users of the network can clearly see where coverage is likely to be available.

## The Changing Landscape

Because PoC is such an important part of the network’s success and continued
growth, it must adapt to change. Change comes in many forms, but the key
changes that have happened since the start of the network are:

* The network has grown exponentially
* Newer radio hardware has been developed
* Newer LoRaWAN features have arisen
* Attempts to subvert PoC have grown in sophistication
* The network has been re-organized to be more scalable (HIP-70)
* The network has diversified; there are more actors and roles available
* A talented and committed community has continued to grow as more Hotspots come online

## The Plan

While some of these changes are challenges to overcome, most of them are
improvements that have remained as untapped resources &mdash; until now. Each of
the items in the roadmap that follows either capitalizes on one of these
improved resources or addresses one of the difficult challenges.

It is also important to recognize that many ideas for improvements to PoC have
been proposed by core developers and community members, not all of which are a
part of this immediate roadmap. After we accomplish the most fundamental and
important steps, improvements that may otherwise have been tabled because they
were deemed too complex to implement will become viable and reconsidered.

# Step 1: Oracle-Based PoC - In Progress

From the launch of the network in 2019 until February 2, 2023, the IOT PoC
system relied on a “Challenger, Beaconer, Witness, Validator, Rewarder” model.
In this model at least five separate actors had to work together in order to
make PoC events happen. Any break in the chain meant the loss of the entire
event and its rewards.

## A History of Artificial Limits

Over these several years the Core Developers noticed breaks in this chain and
have had to enact limits to PoC to keep it functioning under the extraordinary
demand generated by the growth of the network. These limits have frustrated
Hotspot owners and network users alike by making it hard to see just how
effective changes and additions to Hotspot setups were. These limits included:

* A Hotspot could only expect to Beacon roughly once every two days, and
* Only 14 Witnessing Hotspots could be recorded in the results

## Room to Breathe

With the adoption of HIP-70, the Core Developers have been able to adopt a
newer, higher performing model known as “Oracle-Based PoC”. Oracle-Based PoC
brings two important improvements:

* It eliminates the Challenger role, allowing Hotspots to be in charge of their own Beacons, and
* It shifts PoC validation to a higher performance actor, known as the _IOT PoC Verifier Oracle_.

The Verifier Oracle can process and validate PoC events with significantly
less overhead than before, when PoC events had to be validated under strict
real-time deadlines by the members of the currently elected Consensus Group,
and which often led to events silently being dropped just to keep the
blockchain moving.

# Step 2: Removing the Limits to PoC

Now that Oracle-Based PoC is in effect, we can begin to remove some of the restrictions that had been holding PoC back. In short, we will:

* Increase the Beacon rate, and
* Separate Witness reports from Witness Rewards.

## Increasing the Beacon Rate

Increasing the Beacon rate per Hotspot will provide the network and Hotspot
owners with more timely measurements, which in turn will allow them to make
improvements with confidence and allow network users to quickly see new areas
of coverage. Increasing the beacon rate will be evaluated by the IoT PoC
Working Group as a potential upgrade to functionality on the network.

## Publishing the Full Witness List

Under Oracle-Based PoC we can now separately report the entire list of
Witnesses to every Beacon without also requiring the entire list to be
represented on the blockchain, which is solely dedicated to handing out
rewards for the event. The ability to separate these concerns is important
because many Hotspots are routinely Witnessed by many more than the 14
Hotspots reported in the blockchain rewards transaction, but until now there
simply was no place to report them.

With the advent of Oracle-Based PoC, the IOT Verifier Oracle can publish a side report, off chain, of the entire witness list to each and every Beacon on the
network.

# Step 3: Economic Scale Adjustments

Rewards for Beacons and Witness events under PoC are prioritized by a scheme
that was introduced under HIP-17, which was designed to pay higher rewards for
Beacon events that are transmitted from less-covered areas as a way to
encourage Hotspot owners to deploy Hotspots in these areas and discourage
deployments in areas that are already densely covered. PoC currently judges
an area as over- or under-served by consulting a table of density scale
values, which dictates, somewhat arbitrarily, how many Hotspots are needed to
effectively cover a given area.

Currently there are seven “targets” in the list, each of which is a pairing of
an area scale and the ideal number of Hotspots that should be deployed at that
scale. As each Hotspot is added to or removed from the network, the system
examines the deployment and how it affects the Hotspot count at each of these
scales, then it computes a new Transmit Scale for every Hotspot in the regions
affected. If the change is an addition to the network and that addition
increases the density of Hotspots at a particular scale beyond the ideal
density, then every Hotspot in that region has its Transmit Scale reduced.

Since HIP-17’s adoption in late 2020, these scales and density targets have
remained _unchanged_.

We should reconsider each density target individually to ensure that its limit
makes sense, and if not, change it. Additionally, we should consider
shortening the list and removing area scale targets that aren’t helpful, such
as the “Res 4” scale, which roughly covers an area of 1,770 square kilometers
(683 square miles).

# A Collection of Next Steps

After the previously listed steps are adopted, the way forward becomes harder
to predict and the order in which developments must be made is less certain.
Nonetheless, we are certain they will include these “Next Steps”.

# Next Steps: Algorithmic Experiments

With more rapid Beaconing and more stable reporting, we can begin performing
experimental adjustments to PoC that will help it measure the surrounding
radio environment better and make the algorithm more robust against simulation
attacks, aka, “gaming”.

It is hard to predict how effective any one of the many algorithmic proposals
that these changes will be without simply testing them. Proposed ideas include:

* Randomized transmit powers
* Randomized coding rates (Spreading Factors)
* The Addition and/or Removal of Error-correcting codes
* Reintroduction of multi-hop paths, secondary Beacons

# Next Steps: Modeled Coverage

Proof-of-Coverage shouldn’t reward for coverage that is physically impossible
to provide and should use suspicious coverage reports as a possible indicator
of a misbehaving Hotspot. The IOT PoC Verifier should incorporate basic
terrain data and electromagnetic wave propagation models to judge the
plausibility of Witness events and begin to build a trust model to identify
well-behaved Hotspots amongst those that are untrustworthy. 

# Next Steps: Worldwide Reward Harmonization

The IOT network uses several different “unlicensed” radio bands across the
world. Each of these bands comes with its own regulations, some of which can
change from country to country in the space of just a few kilometers. Some of
these regulations limit the output power and dwell times that a Hotspot can
use when transmitting a Proof-of-Coverage Beacon, which ultimately changes how
easily it is heard by other Hotspots in the area, and ultimately affects a
Hotspot’s PoC rewards.

Not all of these limits ultimately affect how well a Hotspot can cover a given
area, and as such, any parameter that artificially inflates or deflates a
Hotspot’s apparent coverage should be accounted for when computing a Hotspot’s
PoC rewards for a Beacon. Once Reward Harmonization is enacted, Hotspot owners
should be able to expect their rewards to be based only on the effectiveness
and uniqueness of their coverage and not by the particular country or region
in which they are deployed.

# Next Steps: Secured Mappers and Concentrators

Introduce specially-hardened hardware elements that can cryptographically
attest to their locations and observations. Incentivise this extra expense
with extra rewards, but continue to let the network be composed of
standardized and cheaper hardware.

# Next Steps: Permissionless Participation

Make it possible for anyone to add a Hotspot to the network and participate
in PoC, just as long as they provide the onboarding fee. The PoC algorithm
will sort out who is providing coverage and who is not. Don’t require a
specialized third party to attest which Hotspots are real and which are
virtualized.
