## Build a Gateway

**Note**: The ability to mine HNT with anything other than prebuilt Hotspots is
currently under development following the conclusion of the DIY Alpha program.
Please join the Helium Discord Server and the #hotspot-diy-hardware channel for
the latest updates on the roadmap here.

To be a Helium Miner, there are three principle components to know about

- **Packet Forwarder**: this is a utility that interacts with the radio
  front-end and sends and receives raw radio packets with the Helium Miner
- **Miner**: the Helium Blockchain comes into the picture here; the Miner is
  responsible for routing packets to the appropriate Router (see our Routing
  article) entering into microtransactions brokered via libp2p
- **Router**: a Helium compatible LoRaWAN Network Server, basically; this
  component is interested in receiving the packets relating to its devices and
  handles downlink responses when appropriate

When you buy [a prebuilt Hotspot](/docs/mine-hnt/prebuilt-hotspots), you are
buying a Packet Forwarder and a Miner in a convenient package. Everything is
ready to go from the moment you plug it in and the device is kept up to date by
Helium, Inc.

However, any device that can run an 8 channel LoRa front-end (such as SX1301 or
SX1302) can be used to participate in the Helium Network. The Miner is designed
to send and receive packets using the Semtech Gateways Messaging Protocol
(GWMP), making it compatible with almost every LoRaWAN Gateway on the Market.
[We have guides for several LoRaWAN Gateways](/docs/mine-hnt/convert-lorawan-gateway)
that work very well and using one of them gives you one less thing to worry
about as the Packet Forwarder is setup and ready to go.

This guide, however, is for those that want a more hands-on experience. We will
essentially be assembling a LoRaWAN gateway with discrete parts, loading up an
open-source Linux distribution, compiling the packet forwarder, and running it
all ourselves. In short, we'll be learning gateways that hard way!

    This guide is experimental and for advanced users only, and you may run in
    to various issues trying to get this working.

### Example Custom Hardware

If you donâ€™t have your own hardware yet, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4B
running the latest
[64-bit RaspiOS](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/) image.

We recommend this configuration in particular if you are interested in running
the Miner on the gateway itself; it's easy to run
[our Docker image from Quay](https://quay.io/repository/team-helium/miner) on a
64-bit ARM system. If you choose to run the Miner elsewhere, it's possible to
downgrade all the way to a Pi0, for example, since you will only be running the
packet forwarder on the gateway.

RAK Wireless sells multiple "Pi Hats" that provide the 8-channel front-end:

- [the RAK2245 (SX1301)](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2245-pi-hat?variant=22914482733156)
- [the RAK2287 (SX1302)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wislink-lpwan/products/rak2287-lpwan-gateway-concentrator-module?variant=34533841535134)

Or you can check out their
[WisGate Developer](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-developer)
line where they provide bundles:

- the D3/D3+/D4/D4+/D4P are all based off of the RAK2245
- the D4H is based off of the RAK2245

Ultimately, which configuration works for you depends on your situation, but all
of them will work with this guide with little adjustment.

### Preparing the SD Card

You can create an SD card from this image by looking for the recently inserted
SD card in your system

```
$ ls -al /dev | grep sd
```

Generally, the timestamp is enough to indicate which device is the SD card. Next
write the image to the SD card. For example:

```
dd if=~/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-arm64.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```

Use the command `sync` to make sure the filesystem is written before trying to
remove the SD card. Once the `sync` command returns, you can eject and remove
the SD card from your system.

### Preparing RaspiOS

With a keyboard, mouse, and monitor plugged in, power on the Raspberry Pi.
Proceed through the guided RaspiOS setup where you will update your password,
configure your WiFi, etc.

Enable SPI and I2C using the raspi-config tool: `sudo raspi-config`

Select `Interface Options`, and enable `I2C` and `SPI` from within the menu
system. This is also a good time to enable SSH if you want it.

### Installing the Semtech Packet Forwarder

Depending on which SX130x radio you are running, you will want to select the
appropriate packet forwarder application.

#### Packet Forwarder SX1302

Pull down Helium's fork of the SX1302 packet forwarder:

`git clone https://github.com/helium/sx1302_hal.git`

Go into the directory and build:

```
$ cd sx1302_hal
$ make
```

Next, go into the the packet_forwarder directory, where we will create a link to
the reset script:

```
$ cd packet_forwarder
$ ln -s ../tools/reset_lgw.sh reset_lgw.sh
```

We will also create a link to the appropriate regional configuration. For
example:

```
ln -s global_conf.json.sx1250.US915 global_conf.json
```

We are now ready to test the start-up. From `~/sx1302_hal/packet_forwarder` try:

```
./lora_pkt_fwd
```

If you get the following output, you are good to go:

```
INFO: [main] concentrator started, packet can now be received
INFO: concentrator EUI: 0x????????????????
```

With `CTRL+D`, exit out of the program and go to the next section.

#### Packet Forwarder SX1301

### Connecting to a Miner

Before proceeding, you want to make sure that
[you have a Miner running](/docs/mine-hnt/run-a-miner). If the Miner is running
on the Raspberry Pi already and is properly mapped to port 1680, then there's
nothing to do! Otherwise, read on.

With your favorite editor, open `global_conf.json` that lives in the packet
forwader directory:

```
nano ~/sx1302_hal/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json
```

You want to change the field "server_address" from "localhost" the the IP
address of the server, so in this case:

You'll need to restart the packet forwarder for the configuration change to take
effect.

To verify that things are working, you can follow the logs on your miner. eg:

```
docker exec miner tail -f /var/log/miner/console.log | grep lora
```

At the very least, you should see PULL_DATA messages every few seconds. If so,
then you've done it!
