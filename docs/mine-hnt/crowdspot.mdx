# Crowdspot

> Analyze. Decide. Vote.

Crowdspot is an unmonitored, self-service tool built by Nova Labs for the community. This tool
allows anyone to explore Helium Network Hotspot data to understand atypical Hotspot behavior and
identity anomalies.

Similar to Voting, submitting Denylist additions, removals requests, or casting a vote on the status
of a Hotspot requires a Crowdspot account associated with a unique Helium Wallet address.

If you do not have the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app), you'll need to download the
app and create a new wallet or import an existing wallet before proceeding.

:::info Crowdspot Connections are Free

There are 0 fees to connect a Helium Wallet address to Crowdspot.

## Log In with the Helium Wallet App

To associate a Helium Wallet address, click the "Login" menu bar item on the Crowdspot homepage and
scan the QR code with your phone.

<img className="appscreenbanner" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/login-popover.png')} />

Once you have scanned the QR Code, the Helium Wallet app will open and prompt you to authenticate
Crowdspot.

1. **Confirm Connection Start**: Confirm that you _do_ want to connect a Helium Wallet to Crowdspot.
2. **Choose Wallet**: Choose the account you would like to use with Crowdspot, and tap Continue.
3. **Authenticate**: Send a transaction to the Helium blockchain to complete login.

If you are already logged in, you will see a Profile Badge and a portion of the connected wallet
address. The Profile badge will match in the Helium Wallet app and on Crowdspot.

Otherwise, if no account is logged in, no Profile Badge is visible, and the "Login" menu bar item is
shown.

### How to Log Out

You can Log out of Crowdspot by clicking your profile badge in the upper right corner and selecting
"Log Me Out" from the pop-up menu.

## Hotspot Evaluation Metrics

Crowdspot provides insight to several metrics for a given Hotspot that can be used to assist the
Community in identifying abnormal Hotpots and validating legitimate Hotspots.

:::note Current Denylist Status

If a Hotspot is currently on the Denylist, they will have a special badge on their page. This badge
is -not- present for Hotspots -not- currently on the Denylist.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/denylist-badge.png')} />
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <p>
        This example badge includes <b>"+ 54 other appearances,"</b> which indicates that this
        particular Hotspot appears on the latest Denylist and <b>54</b> Denylists.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

:::

### Location Confidence

Using witness receipt data, 1,000 guesses of the asserted location are made to derive a predicted
location of a Hotspot.

The Location Confidence Score metric reflects what percentage of ‘guesses’ are within range of the
Hotspots asserted location.

When under 20%of guesses are further than 2.3 km from the asserted location, we would describe that
Hotspot as abnormal.

### Witness Maker Diversity

The Witness Maker Diversity metric gives the percentage of Hotspots witnessed by the original
Hotspot that are produced by different makers.

When under 15% of the Hotspots being witnesses are made by different makers, then we would describe
that Hotspot as abnormal.

### Witness SNR Vs RSSI Plot

This graph compares a Hotspot's Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) against its Relative Signal Strength
(RSSI). In general, small RSSI values correlate to a low SNR and vice versa.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Legitimate Hotspot</b>
      <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/snr-rssi-legit-example.png')} />
      <p>
        Witnesses will likely show a more natural, positive correlation over a broad range of RSSI
        and SNR values.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Abnormal Hotspot</b>
      <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/snr-rssi-sus-example.png')} />
      <p>
        Witnesses tend to appear 'grid-like' and concentrated within a much smaller range of RSSI
        (±3bm) and high SNR (+10db).
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Hotspot Witness Graph

The graph shows a central Hotspot, the Hotspot’s immediate witnesses, and other witnesses
connections within a 10 km range. Each line indicates a witness connection between two Hotspots.
Hotspot owners are represented by unique colors, where Hotspots owned by the same wallet address
will be displayed in the same color.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Legitimate Hotspot</b>
      <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-graph-legit-example.png')} />
      <p>
        The central Hotspot's witnesses vary with placement and the natural terrain of the area.
        These witness connections are more random and feature a wider variety of hotspot owners.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Abnormal Hotspot</b>
      <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-graph-sus-example.png')} />
      <p>
        The central Hotspot can only see a specific subset of Hotspots. This is illustrated by a
        sphere-like containment of Hotspots witnessing only each other, but failing to connect
        outside the containment. There may be less variation of hotspot owners in an abnormal
        cluster.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Witness RSSI Vs Distance

As the distance between Hotspots increases, the signal strength (RSSI) decreases due to
environmental factors. Signal strength ranges between -136 to -80 dBm, with -90 to -110 dBm is a
very strong RSSI (unlikely in real life), while -130 dBm is very weak. Similarly, a high R² value
indicates strong correlation and goodness of fit.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Legitimate Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="homeicon"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-rssi-distance-legit-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        A Hotspot's Witness RSSI compared to distance has a weak “fit” seen through the larger
        deviations from the curve. This results in a low R² value closer to 0.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Abnormal Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="homeicon"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-rssi-distance-sus-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        A Hotspot's Witness compared to distance has a predictable, strong “fit” with minimal
        deviations from the curve. This results in a high R² value close to 1, suggesting few
        effects from environmental factors.
