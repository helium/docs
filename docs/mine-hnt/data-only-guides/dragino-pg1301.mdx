# Data Only Hotspot Setup with Dragino PG1301 and Raspberry Pi

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

A Data Only Hotspot is a type of Hotspot that participates on the Helium Network
by transferring data from the end devices (LoRaWAN nodes). The Data Only
Hotspots are eligible for Network Data Transfer Rewards but not Proof of
Coverage Rewards.

This guide covers all the steps needed to set up a Data Only Hotspot using a
Raspberry Pi and Dragino PG1301 hat.

:::warning
Data Only Hotspots cannot earn $HNT, at least for now, and after
milestone 2 they will earn $HNT only for Device Packet Transfer. Remember to
keep an eye on [Light Hotspots - BETA](/mine-hnt/light-hotspots) and the
**#gateway-development** channel on the
[Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium) to check how the development
process evolves.
:::

## Getting started

This process assumes you have some basic Linux skills, can use a text editor and
understand what a service is. You should be able to use programs like `scp` to
move data between the Raspberry Pi and other computers on your network.

What we will be doing is :

- installing the LoRa Packet Forwarder service from Dragino to use the
  Concentrator hat
- installing the Helium Gateway service to move data between the packet
  forwarder and the Helium network

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4. Other faimilies of Pi may work, but this has only been tested
  on the Pi 4 Model B.
- [Dragino 10 channels - LoRaWAN GPS Concentrator for Raspberry Pi](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/149-lora-gps-hat.html)
- Raspberry Pi is accessing the IP network via the Ethernet port

### Software

We will be using the following:

- Fresh Raspbian Buster image
- lorapktfwd package from
  [Dragino Downloads Site](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/index.php?dir=LoRa_Gateway/PG1301/software/)
- Latest helium-gateway package release from
  [Helium](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases) ending
  in -`-raspi234.deb`

## Configure the Raspberry Pi

1. Use the Raspberry Pi Configuration application and enable the SPI kernel
   module. This is located from the GUI under Preferences, or you can run it
   from the terminal window with `sudo raspi-config`
2. Reboot and verify the changes

I highly suggest enabling SSH to remotely connect to the Pi, and turning off the
Wireless and Bluetooth services to free up cycles and avoid any device
conflicts.

To disable Wireless and Bluetooth, edit the file `/boot/config.txt` and add the
following:

```
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

Be sure to reboot for the changes to take effect.

If you haven't done so, attach the Dragino PG1301 to the Raspberry Pi with the
power off, then power on.

## Install the LoRa Packet Forwarder Service

1. Download lorapktfwd.deb from the
   [Dragino Downloads Site](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/index.php?dir=LoRa_Gateway/PG1301/software/)
2. Install the package: `sudo pkg -i lorapktfwd.deb`

## Configure the LoRa Packet Forwarder

These steps assume the US915 region. For other regions, replace with your region
locale configuration in Step 2.

1. Change directory to the /etc/lora-gateway directory: `cd /etc/lora-gateway`
2. Copy the US915 Band 2 configuration from the cfg subdirectory as
   global_conf.json: `cp cfg/dragino/global_conf.us915_1.json global_conf.json`
3. Generate a unique gateway ID from the Ethernet MAC address:
   ```
   echo `ip a | grep 'link/ether' | cut -d ' ' -f 6 | sed 's/://g'`ffff | tr a-z A-Z > gateway-eui
   ```
   This command will generate your unique gateway ID and save it to a file
   called `gateway-eui`. Example:
   ```
   $ echo `ip a | grep 'link/ether' | cut -d ' ' -f 6 | sed 's/://g'`ffff | tr a-z A-Z > gateway-eui
   $ cat gateway-eui
   DCA632XXXXXXFFFF
   ```
4. Use a text editor and open the /etc/lora-gateway/local_conf.json file. Here
   you will set your gateway ID, and point the LoRa Packet Forwarder to talk to
   the helium gateway service we will install in the next steps. Example:
   ```
   {
     "gateway_conf": {
          "gateway_ID": "DCA632XXXXXXFFFF",
          "server_address": "127.0.0.1",
          "serv_port_up": 1680,
          "serv_port_down": 1680
     }
   }
   ```
   For reference, server address is the local machine (localhost) and port 1680
   is the port the helium service is communicating on.
5. Restart/Start the LoRa Packet Forwarder service:
   `sudo systemctl restart lorapktfwd.service`
6. Verify the service is running: `sudo systemctl status lorapktfwd.service`
7. View the log in real time to verify it is working correctly:
   `journalctl -f -u lorapktfwd.service` . Use Ctrl-C to exit the running log.
   You should see something like:
   ```

   ```
   It can take a minute or two for everything to start up.
8. Enable the LoRa Packet Forwarder to start up at boot time:
   `sudo systemctl enable lorapktfwd.service` . If the service is already
   enabled at boot, the command will return no output.

## Install the Helium Gateway Service

1. Download latest helium-gateway release package from
   https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases ending in -raspi234.deb
2. Install the package using `dpkg`. Example:
   `sudo dpkg -i helium-gateway-v1.0.0-alpha.16-raspi234.deb` (Replace
   helium-gateway-v1.0.0-alpha.16-raspi234.deb) with the version you downloaded.

### Region configuration

The default region of the _helium_gateway_ service is US915, so you can continue
with the next section if you are using this one. Otherwise, you must set your
region frequency in `/etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml`. Add the following line
at the beginning of the file:

```
region = "<region>"
```

Possible values are:

```
US915 | EU868 | EU433 | CN470 | CN779 | AU915 | AS923_1 | AS923_2 | AS923_3 | AS923_4 | KR920 | IN865
```

For instance, if your region is EU868 the content in `settings.toml` must be.

```
region = "EU868"

[log]
method = "syslog"
level = "info"
timestamp = false

[update]
platform = "raspi234"
```

After updating the value, you need to restart the _helium_gateway_ service to
apply the changes.

```
sudo systemctl restart helium_gateway
```

3. Verify the service is running: `sudo systemctl status helium_gateway`
4. If the service is not running (showing active:running), start it: 'sudo
   systemctl restart helium_gateway`
5. View the log in real time to verify it is working correctly:
   `journalctl -f -u helium_gateway` . You should see something like:
   ```

   ```
6. If the service is not running, start it with
   `sudo systemctl restart helium_gateway`
7. To enable the helium gateway service to start at boot time, run
   `sudo systemctl enable helium_gateway` . If the service is already enabled at
   boot, the command will return no output.

Congradulations, your LoRa Packet Forwarder and Helium Gateway service is setup!
At this point your LoRa radio will be able to pass radio traffic between the
network and the Helium gateway. Any devices you registered via the Helium
console should now be live. Your hotspot will not appear on the map. Before
adding your hotspot to the blockchain, please check and backup your
configuration.

## Check and Backup your Configuration

1. Run `helium_gateway key info` to view your gateway address and unique animal
   name assigned to you. Example:
   ```
   $ helium_gateway key info
   {
   "address": "13XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "name": "unique-animal-name"
   }
   ```
2. Backup your gateway key to another machine for recovery purposes. The file
   `/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin` contains the key.

:::warning
If you lose this key, you will not be able to use this hotspot
anymore in case there is a problem on your hostpot (SD card corrupted, etc). You
will need to generate a new key and lose your existing animal name/hostpot
configuration
:::

## Testing the packet transfer with an end device

If you have an end device (LoRaWAN node), you can check if the hotspot can
transfer packets through the network. In other words, you can check if the
devices can send data to the Helium Console. The Helium Console is where you can
provision and manage the end devices, so the nodes need to be registered to
start using the network.

### Some comments and recommendations about the Helium Console

At least for now, it is recommended to use the staging console instead of the
production one when we are transferring data through Data Only hotspots. You can
differentiate them for the URL they use,
[console.helium.com](https://console.helium.com/) for production, and
[staging-console.helium.wtf](https://staging-console.helium.wtf) for staging.
Don't be surprised if you find some differences between those console flavors,
basically staging is where the new features are tested before their rollout to
production.

:::important
If the device you will use for testing is registered on the
production console, it's better to delete it from there to avoid any unexpected
behavior.
:::

To register your end device on the console, you can follow the steps described
on
[Adding Devices](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/adding-devices/).

## What's next?

At this point, after you verified your Data Only Hotspot is working, it is ready
to be added to the blockchain! You can find more information about that process
[here](/mine-hnt/data-only-hotspots#pre-requisites).
