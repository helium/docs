# Data Only Hotspots

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

:::warning
Earning $HNT for data transfer is expected to be enabled at a later time as part of Milestone 2. Please look for updates in #gateway-development channel. This guide is released for preparation only.
:::

:::info
Adding Data-Only Hotspots to the blockchain is now enabled. This is supported via CLI only.
:::

Data Only Hotspots are eligible for **Network Data Transfer Rewards** but not
**Proof of Coverage Rewards**.

Since Data Only Hotspots do not earn Proof-of-Coverage rewards, they may be
permissionlessly added to the blockchain. Once added to the blockchain and
with location asserted, they will earn $HNT when forwarding network data.

| Rewards Type                 | Data Only Hotspots | Full Hotspots |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------- |:------------- |
| Network Data Forwarding      | YES                | YES           |
| Proof of Coverage            | NO                 | YES           |

# Setup a Data Only Hotspot

## Transactions & Cost

Every Hotspot on the blockchain goes through two transactions:
* **add hotspot**: links the Hotspot's key (`swarm_key`) of a Hotspot to a
user's wallet
* **assert location**: provides GPS location, elevation (in meters), and dBi antenna
output for the Hotspot

The fee schedule is as follows:
* **add data only hotspot**: 1000000 DC ($10)
* **assert location**: 500000 DC ($5)

## Pre-requisites

You should [setup a packet forwarder](/use-the-network/setup-a-packet-forwarder)
with the [light hotspot client](/use-the-network/light-hotspots).

In addition, you should setup a [CLI wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet) as this
is currently the only wallet that supports Data Only Hotspots.

**Note**: you can import a mobile wallet to the CLI.
**Another note**: you should __not__ install the CLI on your gateway

## Add Hotspot

### Video Guide for Setup

[![Link to YouTube tutorial explaining packet forwarder setup.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OuujPVK8f3U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuujPVK8f3U)

From a terminal on the device where the Light Hotspot client is installed,
you need to generate the `add hotspot` transaction.

```
./helium_gateway add --owner WALLET_ADDRESS --payer WALLET_ADDRESS
```

The output is a JSON object:

```
{
  "address": "11TL62V8NYvSTXmV5CZCjaucskvNR1Fdar1Pg4Hzmzk5tk2JBac",
  "fee": 65000,
  "mode": "dataonly",
  "owner": "14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz6S",
  "payer": "14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz6S",
  "staking fee": 1000000,
  "txn": "CrkBCiEBrlImpYLbJ0z0hw5b4g9isRyPrgbXs9X+RrJ4pJJc9MkSIQA7yIy7F+9oPYCTmDz+v782GMJ4AC+jM+VfjvUgAHflWSJGMEQCIGfugfLkXv23vJcfwPYjLlMyzYhKp+Rg8B2YKwnsDHaUAiASkdxUO4fdS33D7vyid8Tulizo9SLEL1lduyvda9YVRCohAa5SJqWC2ydM9IcOW+IPYrEcj64G17PV/kayeKSSXPTJOMCEPUDo+wM="
}
```

The `txn` field needs to be used as the input to the wallet command
`helium-wallet hotspot add`. For example:

```
helium-wallet hotspots add CrkBCiEBrlImpYLbJ0z0hw5b4g9isRyPrgbXs9X+RrJ4pJJc9MkSIQA7yIy7F+9oPYCTmDz+v782GMJ4AC+jM+VfjvUgAHflWSJGMEQCIGfugfLkXv23vJcfwPYjLlMyzYhKp+Rg8B2YKwnsDHaUAiASkdxUO4fdS33D7vyid8Tulizo9SLEL1lduyvda9YVRCohAa5SJqWC2ydM9IcOW+IPYrEcj64G17PV/kayeKSSXPTJOMCEPUDo+wM=
```

After you verify the transaction, append the command with `--commit`
to submit it to the API. Note that you need sufficient funds to cover
both the transaction cost (65000 DC) and the `staking_fee` (1000000 DC).
Thanks to the ["implicit burn" mechanism](/blockchain/transaction-fees/#transaction-fees-and-implicit-burn),
available HNT will be used to cover the transaction if you have
insufficient DCs.

You can track the transaction progress by using the
transaction hash at the following endpoint: `https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/TXN_HASH`

Once the transaction clears, you're done linking the Hotspot with your
wallet.

:::warning
At this point, you will want to be certain that you've backed up the
light hotspot's keypair. Its location can be customized in the client's
`settings.toml`, but by default, it's located at
`/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin`
:::

## Assert Hotspot

To assert the Hotspot use `helium-wallet hotspots assert`
```
helium-wallet hotspots assert --gateway LIGHT_GATEWAY_PUBKEY --lat=37.7806295 --lon=-122.4008481 --mode dataonly
```

The `LIGHT_GATEWAY_PUBKEY` in the example from the previous section
would be `11TL62V8NYvSTXmV5CZCjaucskvNR1Fdar1Pg4Hzmzk5tk2JBac`.

`--elevation` and `--gain` can be also set. Use `helium-wallet hotspots assert --help` for more info.

After you verify the transaction, append the command with `--commit`
to submit it to the API. Note that you need sufficient funds to cover
both the transaction cost (65000 DC) and the `staking_fee` (500000 DC).
Thanks to the ["implicit burn" mechanism](/blockchain/transaction-fees/#transaction-fees-and-implicit-burn),
available HNT will be used to cover the transaction if you have
insufficient DCs.

You can track the transaction progress by using the
transaction hash at the following endpoint: `https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/TXN_HASH`

Once the transaction clears, your Data Only Hotspot is ready to start
earning!
