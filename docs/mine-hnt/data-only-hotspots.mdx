# Data Only Hotspots

Data Only Hotspots are eligible for **Network Data Transfer Rewards** but not **Proof of Coverage
Rewards**.

Since Data Only Hotspots do not earn Proof-of-Coverage rewards, they may be permissionlessly added
to the blockchain. Once added to the blockchain and with location asserted, they will earn $HNT when
forwarding network data.

| Rewards Type            | Data Only Hotspots | Full & Light Hotspots |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- |
| Network Data Forwarding | YES                | YES                   |
| Proof of Coverage       | NO                 | YES                   |

# Setup a Data Only Hotspot

## Transactions & Cost

Every Hotspot on the blockchain goes through two transactions:

- **add hotspot**: links the Hotspot's key (`swarm_key`) of a Hotspot to a user's wallet
- **assert location**: provides GPS location, elevation (in meters), and dBi antenna output for the
  Hotspot

The fee schedule is as follows:

- **add data only hotspot**: 1000000 DC ($10)
- **assert location**: 500000 DC ($5)

:::info

Data Credits in your Helium Console organization cannot be used to pay blockchain onboarding and
assert location fees for Hotspots. To onboard a Hotspot, you'll need to burn HNT for Data Credits to
the wallet that owns the Hotspot.

:::

## Pre-requisites

You should [setup a packet forwarder](/use-the-network/setup-a-packet-forwarder) with the
[light hotspot client](/hotspot-makers/light-hotspots).

In addition, you should setup a [CLI wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet) as this is currently the only
wallet that supports DIY Data Only Hotspots. Retail Data Only Hotspots from Hotspot Vendors can be
onboarded using the Vendor IOS and Android apps.

**Note**: you can import a mobile wallet to the CLI. **Another note**: you should **not** install
the CLI on your gateway

## Add Hotspot

From a terminal on the device where the Light Hotspot client is installed, you need to generate the
`add hotspot` transaction.

```
./helium_gateway add --owner WALLET_ADDRESS --payer WALLET_ADDRESS --mode dataonly
```

The output is a JSON object:

```
{
  "address": "11TL62V8NYvSTXmV5CZCjaucskvNR1Fdar1Pg4Hzmzk5tk2JBac",
  "fee": 65000,
  "mode": "dataonly",
  "owner": "14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz6S",
  "payer": "14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz6S",
  "staking fee": 1000000,
  "txn": "CrkBCiEBrlImpYLbJ0z0hw5b4g9isRyPrgbXs9X+RrJ4pJJc9MkSIQA7yIy7F+9oPYCTmDz+v782GMJ4AC+jM+VfjvUgAHflWSJGMEQCIGfugfLkXv23vJcfwPYjLlMyzYhKp+Rg8B2YKwnsDHaUAiASkdxUO4fdS33D7vyid8Tulizo9SLEL1lduyvda9YVRCohAa5SJqWC2ydM9IcOW+IPYrEcj64G17PV/kayeKSSXPTJOMCEPUDo+wM="
}
```

The `txn` field needs to be used as the input to the wallet command `helium-wallet hotspot add`. For
example:

```
helium-wallet hotspots add CrkBCiEBrlImpYLbJ0z0hw5b4g9isRyPrgbXs9X+RrJ4pJJc9MkSIQA7yIy7F+9oPYCTmDz+v782GMJ4AC+jM+VfjvUgAHflWSJGMEQCIGfugfLkXv23vJcfwPYjLlMyzYhKp+Rg8B2YKwnsDHaUAiASkdxUO4fdS33D7vyid8Tulizo9SLEL1lduyvda9YVRCohAa5SJqWC2ydM9IcOW+IPYrEcj64G17PV/kayeKSSXPTJOMCEPUDo+wM=
```

After you verify the transaction, append the command with `--commit` to submit it to the API. Note
that you need sufficient funds to cover both the transaction cost (65000 DC) and the `staking_fee`
(1000000 DC). Thanks to the
["implicit burn" mechanism](/blockchain/transaction-fees/#transaction-fees-and-implicit-burn),
available HNT will be used to cover the transaction if you have insufficient DCs.

You can track the transaction progress by using the transaction hash at the following endpoint:
`https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/TXN_HASH`

Once the transaction clears, you're done linking the Hotspot with your wallet.

:::warning

At this point, you will want to be certain that you've backed up the data only hotspot's keypair.
Its location can be customized in the client's `settings.toml`, but by default, it's located at
`/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin`

:::

## Assert Hotspot

To assert the Hotspot use `helium-wallet hotspots assert`

```
helium-wallet hotspots assert --gateway DATA_ONLY_HOTSPOT_PUBKEY --lat=37.7806295 --lon=-122.4008481 --mode dataonly
```

The `DATA_ONLY_HOTSPOT_PUBKEY` in the example from the previous section would be
`11TL62V8NYvSTXmV5CZCjaucskvNR1Fdar1Pg4Hzmzk5tk2JBac`.

`--elevation` and `--gain` can be also set. Use `helium-wallet hotspots assert --help` for more
info.

After you verify the transaction, append the command with `--commit` to submit it to the API. Note
that you need sufficient funds to cover both the transaction cost (65000 DC) and the `staking_fee`
(500000 DC). Thanks to the
["implicit burn" mechanism](/blockchain/transaction-fees/#transaction-fees-and-implicit-burn),
available HNT will be used to cover the transaction if you have insufficient DCs.

You can track the transaction progress by using the transaction hash at the following endpoint:
`https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/TXN_HASH`

Once the transaction clears, your Data Only Hotspot is ready to start earning for data transfered!

## Data-Only Hotspot Setup Guides

- [Dragino LPS80/DLOS8](/mine-hnt/data-only-guides/dragino)
  - Draginos will only mine HNT as a Data Only Hotspot
- [Kerlink gateways](/mine-hnt/data-only-guides/kerlink)
  - Kerlink gateways will only mine HNT as Data Only Hotspot unless it is specified as a
    Helium-Compatible Kerlink Miner.
- [RAK Concentrator (RAK2245/RAK2247/RAK2287) + Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4](/mine-hnt/data-only-guides/rak-concentrators)
  - This setup will only mine HNT as a Data Only Hotspot.
- [Balena Data Only Hotspot running Raspberry Pi 0, 2, 3 or 4 with RAK Concentrator (RAK2287)](/mine-hnt/data-only-guides/balena-data-only-hotspot)
  - This setup based on Nebra will only mine HNT as a Data Only Hotspot, when possible.
- [Dragino PG1301 + Raspberry Pi 4](/mine-hnt/data-only-guides/dragino-pg1301)
  - This setup based on the Dragino PG1301 Concentrator will only mine HNT as a Data Only Hotspot.

:::info

Gateways running a Packet Forwarder and Miner is not considered a Light Hotspot and will never earn
HNT.
