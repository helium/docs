# Maker Approval and Auditing Process

The community designed and approved a process for adding new, verified Hotspot Makers to the Helium
ecosystem with HIP19<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup>.

[^1]:
    [HIP19: Approval Process For Third-Party Manufacturers](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

With HIP19 in place, companies can submit an application to be reviewed by the community and the
[Helium Foundation](https://www.helium.foundation).

The process initially outlined in
[this blog post](https://docs.helium.com/devblog/2021/01/26/maker-audit.html) for approving and
auditing new Makers is as follows:

1. Makers submit a HIP-19 Proposal.
2. Helium Foundation sends a KYC/B request for documentation.
3. Helium Foundation approves the KYC/B and sends hardware audit information.
4. Makers send hardware samples for audit.
5. Makers obtain and send regulatory radio certifications. \*steps 4 and 5 can happen at the same
   time
6. Once hardware samples pass the hardware audit, they can proceed to Network Integration.
7. The final stage of Network Integration is adding Hotspots to the Onboarding Server.

:::note

The Helium Foundation does not explicitly endorse or recommend Makers, Manufacturers, or Vendors.

The Manufacturing Compliance Committee approves Hotspots produced by Makers to operate on the Helium
Network.
