:::warning Sunsetting Features

Wallet-related functionality in the Helium Hotspot app has been migrated to the new
[Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

Hotspot management of non Helium Branded Hotspots in the Helium Hotspot app has been migrated to the
vendors created apps at [Maker Apps](/mine-hnt/maker-apps).

:::

## Sunsetting the Helium App

> Some users may know the [Helium app](/mine-hnt/helium-hotspot-app) as the "Helium Hotspot App" or
> "the blue app."

The existing [Helium Hotspot app](/mine-hnt/helium-hotspot-app) will be restricted to only the
management of Original Helium Hotspots in two phases.

**Phase 1:**

> ETA December 19, 2022

- Hotspot App users will be migrated to use the Helium Wallet app for Helium Wallet management.
- Users can no longer onboard new Hotspots using the Helium App. All new Hotspots will be directed
  to use the Hotspot's Maker app, web dashboard, or contact email support (in the event that a Maker
  app is not available).

:::info Maker app Availability

All Makers had a deadline to launch their Maker app by March of 2022. Makers without an app or web
dashboard either have an app in development or have not responded to requests for additional
updates.

:::

- Hotspot management for _existing_ Hotspots still available in the Hotspot App.
- The `transfer_hotspot` and `assert_location` will use the Helium Wallet app for signatures.

**Phase 2:**

> ETA January 2023

- Hotspot management will be handled by Maker apps.
- Original Helium Hotspots will be managed by the Helium App.
- All remaining Wallet functionality will use the Helium Wallet app.

:::note What If I Miss The Wallet Migration Deadline?

Users that do not transition to the Helium Wallet app prior to the Solana blockchain migration will
still be able to access their seed phrase and transition to the Helium Wallet app but will not be
able to submit transactions in the Helium app. Seed phrase export functionality will remain in the
app for at least 1 year post blockchain migration.

:::

### Maker Apps

Makers will need to update their [Maker Apps](/mine-hnt/maker-apps#known-maker-apps) to use the new
Solana transaction type to add Hotspots to the network, assert location, and transfer Hotspots.

The core team will make this update available to Makers in an SDK update weeks before the chain halt
to allow Makers time to make the update, release the app to the app store, and available to Hotspot
owners.

The minimum app version will change with each Maker - please check with them for exact details.

:::note Maker Updates

Note that Makers that do not update their Maker apps will mean their customers will not be able to
add new Hotspots to the network, transfer existing Hotspots, or assert locations.

## Helium Hotspot App Overview

The Helium Hotspot App previously focused on people who want to send or receive HNT or manage
Hotspots. other activities, such as managing end-devices and OUIs (i.e. users of the network) are
generally best suited for the command line wallet.

It currently is specifically for managing **only Helium Branded Hotspots**.

The Helium app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hotspot/id1450463605) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet)) included everything you
need to on-board and maintain your Hotspot and view its activity. With the app, which was also your
Helium wallet, you were able to do things like:

- Add your Hotspot to the network and set your location
- Configure your Wi-Fi
- View your Hotspot's activity
- See where other Hotspots are located
