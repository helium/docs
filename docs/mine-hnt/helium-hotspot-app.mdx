## Helium Hotspot App Overview

The Helium Hotspot App previously focused on people who want to send or receive HNT or manage
Hotspots. other activities, such as managing end-devices and OUIs (i.e. users of the network) are
generally best suited for the command line wallet.

It currently is specifically for managing **only Helium Branded Hotspots**.

The Helium app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hotspot/id1450463605) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet)) included everything you
need to on-board and maintain your Hotspot and view its activity. With the app, which was also your
Helium wallet, you were able to do things like:

- Add your Hotspot to the network and set your location
- Configure your Wi-Fi
- View your Hotspot's activity
- See where other Hotspots are located
