# Approved Makers

[Helium, Inc.](https://helium.com) was the first Hotspot manufacturer. Starting in early 2019, they produced the first hardware capable of mining HNT and providing LoRaWAN wireless coverage. In total, Helium, Inc. produced and sold the first 13,000 Hotspots to the Helium community to seed the Network. 

Since the introduction of [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md) three additional approved Makers have been added. Each approved Maker is given a unique onboarding address on the Helium blockchain where they are required to [burn data credits](/blockchain/transaction-fees) to onboard their unique Hotspots before they are granted access to the blockchain.
