# Hotspot QR Code Onboarding

The Helium Hotspot provides a Bluetooth Low Energy\(BLE\) interface for users to
configure several aspects of the device. The BLE services and advertisement data
are provided below.

For those Makers that choose not to include a Bluetooth Radio in their hardware design, they can use QR Code Onboarding to register Hotspots to the Helium Blockchain.

## Overall Process

### Bluetooth Only

The typical Hotspot Onboarding process using Bluetooth is as follows:
1. Enter the Hotspot Onboarding flow by selecting a Maker
2. Instructions to power on and pair with the Bluetooth (Maker-specific)
3. Set up Wi-Fi or Ethernet
4. Set Location and Antenna
5. Submit add_gateway and assert_loc_v2 transactions to the Blockchain

### QR Code Onboarding
A QR Code onboarding process combines both Helium App and an Maker-supplied web dashboard.
1. Enter the Hotspot Onboarding flow and select a Maker with QR Onboarding
2. Instructions to scan a QR code from a Maker's web dashboard. Instructions on which files to update will come as soon as app-side support is added. 
* Makers can choose to include specific URLs and further instructions off-app.
3. Maker's web dashboard provides internet connectivity instructions to the user, gathers gateway signature, owner signature, and generates the add_gateway transaction and embeds the transaction in a QR Code.
4. User scans QR code with the Helium App at the appropriate onboarding screen.
5. App confirms Hotspot information.
6. Set Location and Antenna
7. Submit add_gateway and assert_loc_v2 transactions to the Blockchain.
