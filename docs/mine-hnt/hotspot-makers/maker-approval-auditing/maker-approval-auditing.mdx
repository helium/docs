# Maker Approval and Auditing Process

Due to the overwhelming demand for Hotspots, the community designed and approved a process for adding new, verified manufactures to the ecosystem. [This is known has HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md). With HIP19 in place, companies can submit an application to be reviewed by the community and the [DeWi](https://www.dewi.org/).

The full process for approving and auditing new manafacturers is as follows ([originally outlined in this blog post](https://engineering.helium.com/2021/01/26/maker-audit.html)):

1. Makers submit a HIP.
2. DeWi and Community approve.
3. Makers send hardware samples for Audit.
4. Once Makers pass hardware audit, they are allowed to proceed to Network Integration.
5. The final stage of Network Integration is being able to add Hotspots to the Onboarding Server.
