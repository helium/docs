# Security Requirements

When the Helium Community passed
[HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md),
it was made clear that open and easy access to the `swarm_key` is not permitted
at this time. This helps insure that the Miner is running on real hardware and
increases the barriers to dishonest actors.

:::info

The `swarm_key` is an ECC Compact Key used by the Miner to sign all blockchain
and libp2p transactions. The three word animal name (e.g. angry-purple-tiger) is actually
derived from the public key of the `swarm_key`.

:::

While formalizing the audit process, DeWi has determined that the only approved
approach to guaranteeing this at this time is using the ECC608 to generate and
store the key during manufacturing. Other approaches are possible, but they
would require case-by-case consideration and the potentially a third-party
audit.

## Securing the swarm_key with the ECC608

Helium has open-sourced their ECC608 provisioning utility from their own
manufacturing process [here](https://github.com/helium/gateway_mfr). By using
this utility, not only do you automatically comply with the ECC608 provisioning
process, but you also create compatability with the Helium Miner with no
modifications (other than some configuration to the
[Docker overlay](/mine-hnt/hotspot-makers/docker-integration/#enable-ecc608-and-d-bus)).

You are free to compile the `gateway_mfr` repository from source or use the
[Docker image available here (for aarch64 only)](https://helium-media.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gateway_mfr-aarch64.tar).

You will want to do the following:

```
docker load -i gateway_mfr.tar
docker run -d --device /dev/i2c-1 --name provision gateway_mfr:arm64
```

With the Docker container running, you are now able to interact with the utility
and complete the provisioning.

Throughout this process, you might get some errors because the ECC608 can
frequently go to sleep. You may see something like this:

```
docker exec provision gateway_mfr ecc onboarding
ecc_asleep
```

It is just fine to liberally retry commands until they work.

First, verify that the ECC608 is untouched:

```
$ docker exec provision gateway_mfr ecc test
+--------------------+-------------------------------+
|        name        |            result             |
+--------------------+-------------------------------+
|     serial_num     |              ok               |
|{zone_locked,config}|       {error,unlocked}        |
| {zone_locked,data} |       {error,unlocked}        |
|    slot_config     |{error,{invalid_slot_config,0}}|
|     key_config     |{error,{invalid_key_config,3}} |
|     miner_key      |{error,ecc_response_exec_error}|
+--------------------+-------------------------------+
```

This is a failing test, which is good in this case. Next, you will want to run
the actual provision command:

```
$ docker exec provision gateway_mfr ecc provision
{zone_locked,[{config,true},{data,true}]}
+--------------------+------+
|        name        |result|
+--------------------+------+
|     serial_num     |  ok  |
|{zone_locked,config}|  ok  |
| {zone_locked,data} |  ok  |
|    slot_config     |  ok  |
|     key_config     |  ok  |
|     miner_key      |  ok  |
+--------------------+------+
```

You can run the test from the end of the provision command to verify the table
at any time:

```
docker exec provision gateway_mfr ecc test
+--------------------+------+
|        name        |result|
+--------------------+------+
|     serial_num     |  ok  |
|{zone_locked,config}|  ok  |
| {zone_locked,data} |  ok  |
|    slot_config     |  ok  |
|     key_config     |  ok  |
|     miner_key      |  ok  |
+--------------------+------+
```

And finally, you will want to extract the `onboarding_key` which is also called
the Miner's "swarm_key":

```
docker exec provision gateway_mfr ecc onboarding
112xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This is what you will want to provide to the
[onboarding server](/mine-hnt/hotspot-makers/hotspot-integration-testing/#adding-hotspots-to-the-onboarding-server).
