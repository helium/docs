# Light Hotspots - Beta

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

This document describes the architecture and technical roadmap planned for
converting existing Approved Hotspots to Light Hotspots. As part of this
migration, we have introduced a new Hotspot variant onto the network, called
a [Data Only Hotspot](/mine-hnt/data-only-hotspots). More details on progress
and timeline are listed below.

This project is in progress and subject to change. **Last updated Wednesday October 6, 2021**.

Hotspots, please join the #gateway-development channel on

## What is a Light Hotspot?

Light Hotspots are the evolution of how LoRaWAN gateways will interact with the
Helium blockchain. Since the genesis block, the Helium blockchain has run
entirely on the physical Hotspot itself. As the blockchain network grows, each
Hotspot running a full node undergoes increasing load and are starting to fall
out of sync due to the higher compute requirements.

To mitigate this, the **Hotspot's consensus work has been moved off of physical
Hotspots and onto Validators as of July 8, 2021**. This simplifies the architecture and enables
us to grow the Network exponentially while keeping blocktimes and epochs stable.

As all approved Hotspots transition to a Light Hotspot architecture, we also
introduce a new type of Hotspot known as Data Only Hotspots, **activated as of July 20, 2021**, to satisfy the
increasing demand and continue to expand network coverage.

## Light Hotspot Properties

When the Light Hotspot Client is fully developed and in production (which
will happen with the completion of Milestone 4 detailed below) they will
satisfy the following properties:

- A Hotspot on the Helium network that, via [Validators](/mine-hnt/validators),
  can participate in PoC beacons and witnesses, and forwards data packets;
- Does not store a copy of the Blockchain, eliminating synchronization;
- Does not create challenges (relies on Validators to create challenges on their
  behalf);
- Does not participate in Consensus Groups (relies on Validators for block
  production);
- Will no longer depend on libp2p or "gossip", and instead use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a new framework to communicate between distributed systems;
- Will be eligible to earn $HNT (see table below)

In other words, the client will allow the Hotspot to participate as a
[Full Hotspot](/mine-hnt/full-hotspots), without the extra overhead of maintaining a local copy
of the blockchain.

## Architecture

This image shows the progression to Light Hotspots, with the role of Miner being
deprecated as we move the blockchain off the Hotspots and into the Validator
infrastructure. At the conclusion of Milestone 4, the entire Helium blockchain,
and the coordination of Proof of Coverage, will be handled by Validators.

## Code and Development

The bulk of the code that enables Light Hotspots on actual LoRaWAN gateways is
called [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs). It's easiest to think
of this as Helium's next-generation packet forwarder.

Development of this code takes place in the above GitHub repo, as well at the
`#gateway-developement` channel on the
[Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium).

## Development Milestones

The development of Light Hotspots will be broken up into the five following
milestones.

### Milestone 1: Free Packet Forwarding

- Target Completion Date: March 18
- Status: COMPLETE

At the completion of Milestone 1, any LoRaWAN gateways running
[gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) can route packets to and from
the Helium Network **but not earn HNT.** This means an DIY gateway can send and
receive data on the Network. These LoRaWAN Gateways running `gateway-rs` are known
as Data Only Hotspots.

### Milestone 1.5: Add Hotspot to Blockchain

- Target Completion: early July
- Status: COMPLETE

At the completion of Milestone 1.5, Data Only Hotspots can be added to the
blockchain, assert its location, and be seen on explorer.helium.com.

Data Only Hotspots are added to the blockchain by paying a $10 Add Gateway
transaction fee, and a $5 Assert location transaction fee using the
[Helium Wallet CLI](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) and will not
earn $HNT.

### Milestone 2: Earn HNT For Device Packet Transfer

- Target Completion: Fall 2021
- Status: Development In Progress

Data Only Hotspots will earn $HNT for device data transfer. A further breakdown of progress is outlined below:

#### Milestone Breakdown
- server side updates for `state_channels` (complete)
- `gateway-rs` will use a new rust-based `state_channel` client (complete)
- final bug fixing and testing (in progress)
- expected completion to be mid-October 2021

#### Path to Milestone 3 and Milestone 4
Developing in parallel with Milestone 2, the following work is also under development. 

- Change how Hotspots route data packets by replacing its `state_channel` client from erlang to rust, taking advantange of the improvements in gRPC and data streaming (in progress)
- Update how Hotspots receive, emit, and acknowledge proof-of-coverage receipts from erlang to rust (in progress, targets milestone 4)
- Update how full Hotspots communicate from libp2p to gRPC and follow a Validator for ledger information instead of syncing a local copy of the blockchain (in progress, targets milestone 4)
- Implement the work to move Challenge creation to Validators from Hotspots, to be gated behind a chain variable (HIP in progress)
- Activate the chain variable to move Challenge creation to Validators (to be announced)
  - At this point, existing Hotspots no longer need to sync or absorb the blockchain, and will satisfy another property of Light Hotspot
  - Hotspots existing on-chain will be able to participate in Proof-of-Coverage, no longer need to syncronize the blockchain, and will require less computational power (Milestone 4)

### Milestone 3: Introduction of Light Hotspots

- Target Completion: Q1 2022
- Status: Development in Progress/PoC work started

Approved Hotspots from
[HIP19-approved manufacturers](/mine-hnt/full-hotspots/#approved-makers) with
lower compute requirements can be added to the network and participate in PoC.

Onboarding for these Light Hotspots will be done via the standard Helium Wallet
app onboarding. The fees will be equivalent to other Approved Hotspots ($40 and
$10 for add assert, respectively).

At this stage, there will be three types of Hotspots:

1. Approved Hotspot (HIP-19 approved, earns HNT for PoC and Data Transfer,
   follows Blockchain)
2. Light Hotspot (HIP-19 approved, earns HNT for PoC and Data Transfer)
3. Data Only Hotspot (DIY LoRaWAN Gateway, earns HNT for Data Transfer)

### Milestone 4: "Heavy" Hotspots -> Light Hotspots

- Target Completion: Q1 2022
- Status: Development in Progress

Approved Hotspots on the Network will be converted
to run [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) and will be dependent
on Validators to generate challenges and process witness receipts.

Hotspots will not need to follow the Blockchain.

Work on Milestone 4 has already started, please see **Path to Milestone 3 and 4** above.
