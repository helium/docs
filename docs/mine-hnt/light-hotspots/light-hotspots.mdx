# Light Hotspots - Beta

This document describes the architecture and technical roadmap planned for Light Hotspots.

:::warning

Everything here is very much beta and subject to change.

## What is a Light Hotspot?

Light Hotspots are the evolution of how physical LoRaWAN gateways will interact with the Helium blockchain. Since the genesis block, the Helium blockchain has run entirely on the physical Hotspot itself. This is no small feat, especially considering it's now running on [tens of thousands of globally-distributed Hotspots](https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots). But in the interest of greater scalability and security, the Helium blockchain needs to be moved off of the physical Hotspots and onto more robust cloud-based servers ([called Validators](/mine-hnt/validators), being developed in parallel). This will simplify the architecture immensely, an enable us to grow the Network exponentially while keeping blocktimes and epochs stable. And, over time, it will enable just about any LoRaWAN gateway to join the Helium Network, provide coverage, and mine HNT. 

## Light Hotspot Properties

When Light Hotspots are fully developed and in production (which will happen with the completion of Milestone 4 detailed below) they will satisfy the following properties:

* A Hotspot on the Helium network that, via [Validators](/mine-hnt/validators), can participate in PoC beacons and witnesses, and forwards data packets;
* Does not store a copy of the Blockchain;
* Does not create challenges (instead relies on Validators to create challenges on their behalf);
* Does not participate in Consensus Groups (again, relies on Validators for block production);
* Will be eligible to earn $HNT for all [packet forwarding and all POC-related mining rewards](/blockchain/mining/#how-do-hotspots-earn-helium-tokens) except for the Consensus Group rewards (which will only be mined by Validators). 

## Architecture 

This image shows the progression to Light Hotspots, with the role of Miner being deprecated as we move the blockchain off the Hotspots and into the Validator infrastructure. At the conclusion of Milestone 4, the entire Helium blockchain, and the coordination of Proof of Coverage, will be handled by Validators.

## Code and Development 

The bulk of the code that enables Light Hotspots on actual LoRaWAN gateways is called [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs). It's easiest to think of this as Helium's next-generation packet forwarder.

Development of this code takes place in the above GitHub repo, as well at the `#gateway` channel on the [Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium).

## Development Milestones 

The development of Light Hotspots will be broken up into the five following milestones. 

### Milestone 1 
#### Free Packet Forwarding

* **Target Completion Date: March 18**
* **Status: COMPLETE**

At the completion of Milestone 1, any LoRaWAN gateways running [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) can route packets to and from the Helium Network **but not earn HNT.** This means an DIY gateway can send and receive data on the Network.


### Milestone 1.5 
#### Add Light Hotspot to Blockchain

* **Target Completion: End of March**
* **Status: IN DEVELOPMENT**


When  Milestone 1.5 is done, Light Hotspots can be formally added to blockchain and be seen on the [Helium Coverage Map](https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots). Light Hotspots will be required to pay $20 transaction fee to join the blockchain, and $10 assert location fee. (Full Hotspots pay $40 and $10 for add assert, respectively.)

At this phase, Light Hotspots will be onboarded using the [Helium Wallet CLI](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs), and **will not earn any HNT**. 

### Milestone 2
#### Paid Packet Forwarding

* **Target Completion: April/May**
* **Status: NOT YET STARTED**

All Light Hotspots will be able to earn HNT for packet forwarding. 


### Milestone 3
#### Earn HNT for POC

* **Target Completion: Post Milestone 2**
* **Status: NOT YET STARTED**

At this point, Light Hotspots from [HIP19-approved manufacturers](/mine-hnt/hotspot-makers/approved-makers) will be able to earn HNT for POC. (Kerlink is the first approved maker to submit a [light hotspot design](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers/kerlink.md).) And onboarding for these Light Hotspots will be done via the standard Helium Wallet app onboarding. 

This milesone is dependent on Validators being fully live on mainnet with the ability to generate challenges and process witness receipts 

### Milestone 4
#### All Hotspots Operate as Light Hotspots

* **Target Completion: Post Milestone 3**
* **Status: NOT YET STARTED**

In the final milestone, all existing Hotspots on the Network will be converted to run [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) and will be dependent on Validators to generate challenges and process witness receipts.
