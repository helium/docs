# Maker Apps

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

This document describes what Maker apps are and how users interact with them on the Helium Network.

Beginning March 2022, all [HIP-19](https://github.com/dewi-alliance/hotspot-manufacturers#readme)
Hotspot Manufacturers (aka Makers) are required to support their customers with a bespoke Mobile App
to onboard their Hotspots, maintain their Hotspots with diagnostic tools, and various basic
troubleshooting tools.

Maker Apps can also include extra enhancements such as Proof-of-Coverage analysis, earnings tools,
and more.

For more information,
[read our blog post announcing this change](https://blog.helium.com/the-future-of-hotspot-apps-and-wallets-in-the-helium-ecosystem-a5b904b01d62).

## SDKs and Starter Apps

To assist Makers in developing their apps, an SDK and supporting libraries are available. An example
starter app is also open-sourced for forking and further customization.

### React Native SDK

The Helium React Native SDK is a collection of modules that can be used by a React Native
application to interact with Hotspots and the Helium Blockchain. It has first class support for
Typescript.

### Maker Starter App

The [Maker Starter App](https://github.com/helium/maker-starter-app) includes support for
deeplinking to the Helium Wallet App to sign transactions, removing any requirements for users to
enter their 12 word seed phrase into the Maker App. **This is a security precaution and prevents
potential lost of funds and Hotspots, as the seed phrase acts as a user's private key on the
blockchain.** If you find a Maker app that asks for your seed phrase, do not trust it.

#### Features

The following features are supported in the Maker Starter App:

- Add a Hotspot
- Set a Location (including gain and elevation)
- Transfer a Hotspot
- Settings with PIN Code and language selection
- Deeplinking to [Helium Wallet](/wallets/app-wallet) to sign transactions
