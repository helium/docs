# What is a Helium Miner?

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/mine-hnt/mint-hnt-hotspot.jpg")} />

Every Miner on the Helium Blockchain is first and foremost a LoRaWAN coverage
provider. A Miner provides long-range wireless coverage for very low power and
inexpensive IoT devices.

Therefore, a Miner boils down to two principle components:

- a LoRaWAN gateway
- [the Miner Client](https://github.com/helium/miner)

Every LoRaWAN gateway provides some "packet forwarder" application which is how
the Miner sends and receives radio packets. In turn, the Miner uses libp2p over
some standard Internet to communicate with other Miners and with Helium Network
Servers (ie: the servers that "own" the devices on the network).

The mechanics of mining and earnings on the Network are more fully covered in
[other sections](blockchain/mining). This section focuses on practical hardware
and software requirements for operating a Miner.

We will cover everything from [prebuilt Hotspots](mine-hnt/prebuilt-hotspots),
generic LoRaWAN gateways which require running your own Miner, to building your
own gateway using a Raspberry Pi.

**Note**: The ability to mine HNT with anything other than prebuilt Hotspots is
currently under development following the conclusion of the DIY Alpha program.
Please join the Helium Discord Server and the #hotspot-diy-hardware channel for
the latest updates on the roadmap here. To be a Helium Miner, there are three
principle components to know about
