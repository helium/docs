# Mine HNT

Any Helium-enabled Hotspot (sometimes called a **miner** or **gateway**) can mine $HNT. Helium Hotspots were originally built by Helium, Inc. and our now handled by our growing ecosystem of approved manufacturers.

### Hotspot Makers 

Interested in becoming a **Hotspots Maker**? Any qualified company can be approved by the Helium community to manufacture and distribute Hotspots. [Learn more about the process and requirements here](/mine-hnt/hotspot-makers).

### Approved Hotspots 

A full list of approved Hotspots with details on how to acquire them [can be found here](https://www.helium.com/mine).

### Build a Helium Packet Forwarder

As of today, only approved Hotspots can participate in mining $HNT. However, any LoRaWNAN Gateway can converted to route packets to the Helium Network for development and production applications. [Start here](/mine-hnt/build-a-packet-forwarder).
