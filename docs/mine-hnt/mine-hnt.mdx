# Mine HNT

Any Helium-enabled Hotspot (sometimes called a **miner** or **gateway**) can
mine $HNT. Helium Hotspots were originally built by Helium, Inc. and our now
handled by our growing ecosystem of approved manufacturers.

### Hotspot Makers

Interested in becoming a **Hotspots Maker**? Any qualified company can be
approved by the Helium community to manufacture and distribute Hotspots.

### Approved Hotspots

A full list of approved Hotspots with details on how to acquire them
[can be found here](https://www.helium.com/mine).

### Build a Helium Packet Forwarder

As of today, only approved Hotspots can participate in mining $HNT. However, any
LoRaWAN Gateway can be converted to route packets to the Helium Network for
development and production applications.
