## Prebuilt Hotspots

Buying a prebuilt Hotspot is by the far the easiest way to Mine on the Network.
They combine a LoRaWAN Gateway with the Helium Miner in a single, easy to setup
package and work seamlessly with the Helium Wallet App.

There are two models in existence:

- the Helium Hotspot
- the RAK Hotspot Miner

being sold but may be available for after-market purchase.
