# Hotspot Status

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

Hotspots are the heart of the Helium Network, creating coverage for devices to send data.

These Hotspots must communicate their availability and connectedness to the outside world so they
can be relied upon to help route packet data from devices.

## Online or Offline

A Hotspot, whether a Full, Light, or Data-Only, all confer on one metric to determine if it's
"Online" or available to transfer device packets.

If a Hotspot has had any blockchain activity in the past **36 hours**, the network considers the
Hotspot "Online."

Blockchain Activity can include:

- Added to the Network for the first time
- Was a challengee (initiated the Challenge, from a Challenger) in a Proof-of-Coverage event
- Was a witness in a Proof-of-Coverage event
- Transferred device packets for a device
- Received mining rewards
