# Validator Releases

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

To provide a consistent, predictable release cadence and window for validator updates, the team will move to a consistent release cadence for planned updates. 

Initially, these updates will be released on a weekly basis and will gradually move to every two weeks. The team plans to release Wednesday mornings PT. 

Important and Critical updates will be released out of band when available. Each release will be tagged with a color code, see table below.
