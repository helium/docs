# Monitor a Validator

The Docker commands will assume you have the same prefix to get you executing a command within the docker: ```docker exec validator``` . If you want to make it easier, you can always create an alias such as: ```alias miner="docker exec validator miner"```.

## Check the p2p network

Perform a health check to see if your validator node can see other validators. 

Once your validator is running perform an initial health check to verify you're connected to peers, your NAT type has been correctly identified, and that you have listen addresses:

Source: ```miner peer book -s```

Docker: ```docker exec validator miner peer book -s```

:::note

It could take several minutes before the peers appear in the table.

:::

Once you have an address listed in ```listen_addrs``` and ```peers``` in the table at the bottom, you're connected to the p2p network.

## View block height

When the genesis block is loaded, this query will work and return height 1 at least:

Source: ```miner info height```

Docker: ```docker exec validator miner info height```

If youâ€™re syncing something similar to the following should appear:
```
~$ docker exec validator miner info height
14        449
```

The first number is the **election epoch** and the second number is the **block height** of your validator.
