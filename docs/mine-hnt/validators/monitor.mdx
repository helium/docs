# Monitor a validator

The Docker commands will assume you have the same prefix to get you executing a command within the docker: ```docker exec miner``` . If you want to make it easier, you can always create an alias such as: ```alias miner="docker exec miner miner"```.

## Check the p2p network

Perform a health check to see if your validator node can see other validators. 

Once your validator is running perform an initial health check to verify you're connected to peers, your NAT type has been correctly identified, and that you have listen addresses:

Source: ```miner peer book -s```

Docker: ```docker exec miner miner peer book -s```

Once you have an address listed in ```listen_addrs``` and ```peers``` in the table at the bottom, you're connected to the p2p network and good to go.

## View block height

When the genesis block is loaded, this query will work and return height 1 at least:

Source: ```miner info height```

Docker: ```docker exec miner miner info height```

If youâ€™re syncing something similar to the following should appear:
```
~$ miner info height
6889        280756
```

The first number is the election epoch and the second number is the block height of your validator.
