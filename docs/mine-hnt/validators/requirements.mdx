# Technical Requirements

Based on early tests, validator node requirements include:

- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (if running from source)
- CPU: Intel processor 3.0 GHz or above with 2 cores or equivalent
- Memory: 8 GB or above
- Storage: 256 GB or more
- If using AWS, a T2 large or xlarge EC2 instance or equivalent is recommended. If using another cloud provider, like GCP, Azure, or Digital Ocean, an instance with the same capabilities should be the target.
- Static IP address with port `2154`(TCP) opened in your firewall with a route available to your validator host.
- Running on stable network connections free of things like proxies, NAT, etc. The load is largely symmetrical when producing blocks, so good upstream connectivity recommended.
- It is [discouraged to run Mainnet Validators at home](/mine-hnt/validators/validator-faqs-resources).

Please review the [Expectations for Running a Validator on Testnet](/mine-hnt/validators) for additional expectations.
