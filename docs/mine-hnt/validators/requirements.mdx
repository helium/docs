# Technical Requirements

Based on early tests, validator node requirements include:
* Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (if running from source)
* CPU: Intel processor 3.0 GHz or above with 2 cores or equivalent
* Memory: 8 GB or above
* Storage: 256 GB or more 

* If using AWS, a T2 large or xlarge EC2 instance or equivalent is recommended. If using another cloud provider, like GCP, Azure, or Digital Ocean, an instance with the same capabilities should be the target.

* Stable IP with port `2154`(TCP) open to Internet.

* Running on stable network connections free of things like proxies, NAT, etc. The load is largely symmetrical when producing blocks, so good upstream connectivity recommended.
