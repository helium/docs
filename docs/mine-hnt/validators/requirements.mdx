The following are meant to be used as guidelines for the hardware requirements when building a
validator, more so than absolute requirements, to help minimize your
[performance penalties](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/penalties/). Minimizing your
penalties increases your chances of being elected to the Consensus Group and earning more rewards.

As the role of validator continually grows, it may require more resources over time. Once you have
built your validator, please refer to the [Performance Baselining](#performance-baselining) section
below.

Most Validator operators who experience the least penalties have configurations similar to or
greater than these guidelines:

- Physical or Virtual:
  - Many validators with the least amount of penalties run bare metal validators rather than a
    Virtual Private Server (VPS)
- Internet Connectivity:
  - Commercial grade Internet connectivity with quality upstream providers and redundancy such as
    BGP. Not home fiber or cable modem connections.
  - Commercial grade router/firewall capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections, not
    consumer grade routers that may cause you to incur penalties due to dropped network connections
    while in the consense group.
  - Stable data center/cloud grade network connection free of proxies, NAT, etc. The load is largely
    symmetrical when producing blocks, so quality upstream connectivity is required.
  - Static WAN IP address with ports `2154tcp` and `8080 tcp` opened on firewall with a route
    available to your validator host.
  - Note: Port 8080 is required for communications with light hotspots a.k.a. light gateways
- Operating system:
  - When running from docker: Any linux based system capable of running docker
  - When running from source: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - Note: Testing has shown there is ~20% overhead when running from docker when compared to running
    from source. If you are running a single validator on bare metal hardware, this overhead is
    negligable but can be more pronounced when running on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or running
    multiple validators on a single bare metal server.
- CPU:
  - Intel, AMD or ARM based processor 3.0 GHz or above with 4 cores or equivalent, such as AMD Ryzen
    Zen3 CPU (5950X being the top choice) and Intel i9-12900K.
  - Note: Single threaded performance is more important than multi-threaded performance
  - Note: The vCPU term within a VPS is not a "core" but often just a hyperthread
  - [GeekBench 5](https://www.geekbench.com/) scores of greater than 1,000 Single-Core and greater
    than 5,000 Multi-core have performed well. Many of the high performance validators score higher
    than 2,000 for Single-core and 15,000 for Multi-core
  - For Intel and AMD systems,
    [AVX2 or AVX support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is required.
    Verify your CPU supports these extensions by checking `grep avx /proc/cpuinfo` and verifying
    that AVX support is included in the output.
- Memory: 16 GB or above (many validators run more)
- Storage: 20GB or more standard disk for OS and 256GB or more, high performance NVME for
  validator_data. 64GB of standard speed disk is sufficient for testnet. It is recommended that you
  keep your validator_data directory on a separate high performace disk from the OS.
  - Examples of PCI Express NVMe 4.0 that validators use are Sabrent Rocket Plus 2TB, Seagate
    FireCuda 530 2TB and Western Digital WD Black. NOTE: 2TB NVME dual sided drives have higher IOPS
    than single sided NVME drives.
- Public Cloud/VPS:
  - If using AWS, a t2.xlarge or c5a.xlarge EC2 instance or equivalent is recommended.
  - If using another cloud provider, like GCP, Azure, or Digital Ocean, an instance with similar
    capabilities should be the target.

See details for why Validators
[SHOULD NOT BE RUN ON A HOME NETWORK](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/faqs-resources-providers/#technical).
The one exception to this is if you live at an actual data center. If that's the case, you're
allowed to run Validators at home.

## Performance Baselining

- Follow these steps after the validator is caught up to the tip of the chain and running normally
  for a few hours.
- Review the underlying hardware your provider is using. You can review your instance cpu speeds by
  using `cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep -i "name|stepping|Mhz" | sort | uniq -c`. Some providers use the
  Turbo speeds as marketing and others the regular speed of the processor.
- Install sar package using `sudo apt install sysstat`
  - Confirm that sar is enabled in `/etc/default/sysstat` review that the `ENABLED` line is set to
    `true`.
  - Review the cron job and is set to the correct schedule that you would like to collect stats on.
    You can `sudo vi etc/cron.d/sysstat` file to adjust the default of collecting every 10 minutes
    `*/10 ...`.
- You can review your CPU steal using `sar` and looking at the `%steal` column. Averages of over 1%
  you should think about moving providers. You can also see this metric in `top` look for the `st`
  cpu metric on the second line.
- You can review your IOPS using `sar -b`
- You can review your Disk Bandwidth using `sar -d -p | egrep "sd[a-z]|DEV"` NOTE: this example
  command line is assumes `/dev/sd<some letter>` device names. Your instance may have disks with
  different device names, so change this command as needed.
- You can review your Disk Latency with `sar -d -p | egrep "sd[a-z]|DEV"` review the `await` which
  should be < 10ms
- Review your Absorb and Commit Block times and they should be < 2500ms on average, not including
  the rewards blocks that will be much higher. To check ongoing times you can use
  `tail -f log/console.log | grep -E 'add_block|absorb_and_commit'`
- Once your validator is caught up you can use
  `grep -E 'add_block|absorb_and_commit' log/console.log | awk '{print $6 $8 }' | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\ngossipped/ /g'`
  as a historical listing of your console.log
- If you believe you are having trouble getting the advertised disk performance you can install and
  run the `fio` package to give you a full baseline of disk performance. Make sure to not be in a
  Consensus Group while benchmarking using `fio`. You can do this by running
  `miner info in_consensus`.
- You can also refer to some steps shown at
  [Troubleshooting](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/troubleshooting/) to check
  performance.
