# Technical Requirements

Based on early tests, validator node requirements include:
* Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (if running from source)
* CPU: Intel processor 3.0 GHz or above with 2 cores or equivalent
* Memory: 8 GB or above
* Storage: 256 GB or more 

* If using a cloud provider (recommended) an AWS EC2 instance T2 large, xlarge or equivalent

* Stable IP and few ports (currently 2154 and eventually port 443) open to internet

* DNS resolvable URL strongly recommended

* Running on stable network connections (without things like proxies, NAT, etc.), load is largely symmetrical when producing blocks, so good upstream recommended.
