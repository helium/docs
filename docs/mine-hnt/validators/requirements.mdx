Based on early tests, validator node requirements include:

- Operating system: 
  - Planning on running from docker: Any linux based system capable of running docker
  - Planning on running from source: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- CPU: 
  - Intel, AMD or ARM based processor 3.0 GHz or above with 2 cores or equivalent
  - In testnet, scores of [GeekBench 5](https://www.geekbench.com/) Multi-Core of greater than 2,200 have performed well
  - For Intel and AMD systems, [AVX2 or AVX support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is required. Verify your CPU supports these extensions by checking `grep avx /proc/cpuinfo` and verifying that AVX support is included in the output.
  - These recommendations may change for mainnet as the size of consensus groups grow and hotspot transactions are added
- Memory: 8 GB or above
- Storage: 256 GB or more for mainnet.  64GB is sufficient for testnet.
- If using AWS, a t2.large or t2.xlarge EC2 instance or equivalent is recommended. If using another cloud provider, like GCP, Azure, or Digital Ocean, an instance with similar capabilities should be the target.
- Static IP address with ports `2154`(TCP) and `8080`(TCP) opened in your firewall with a route available to your validator host.
- Running on stable network connection free of things like proxies, NAT, etc. The load is largely symmetrical when producing blocks, so good upstream connectivity recommended.
- It is [discouraged to run Validators at home](/mine-hnt/validators/faqs-resources-providers/#technical). The one exception to this is if you live at an actual data center. If that's the case, you're allowed to run Validators at home.
