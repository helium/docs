Validator node requirements include:

- Operating system: 
  - Running from docker: Any Linux-based system capable of running docker
  - Running from source: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- CPU: 
  - Intel, AMD or ARM-based processor 3.0 GHz or above with 2 cores or equivalent
  - In Testnet, scores of [GeekBench 5](https://www.geekbench.com/) multi-core of greater than 2,200 have performed well
  - For Intel and AMD systems, [AVX2 or AVX support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is required. Verify your CPU supports these extensions by checking `grep avx /proc/cpuinfo` and verifying that AVX support is included in the output.
  - These recommendations may change for Mainnet as the size of consensus groups grow and Hotspot transactions are added
- Memory: 8 GB or above
- Storage: 256 GB or more for Mainnet.  64 GB is sufficient for Testnet.
- If using AWS, a t2.large or t2.xlarge EC2 instance or equivalent is recommended. If using another cloud provider, like GCP, Azure, or Digital Ocean, choose an instance with similar capabilities.
- Static IP address with port `2154`(TCP) opened in your firewall with a route available to your Validator host.
- Running on stable network connection free of things like proxies, NAT, etc. The load is largely symmetrical when producing blocks, so good upstream connectivity recommended.
- It is [discouraged to run Validators at home](/mine-hnt/validators/faqs-resources-providers#technical).
