There is no direct migration path to move Testnet Validators to Mainnet. For Testnet users youâ€™ll need to do the following:

1. Stop and remove any existing Testnet Validators;
2. Delete the data directory (including `swarm_key`). You'll need a new swarm key. The Testnet Validator swarm key is NOT valid for Mainnet;
3. Deploy a new Validator using instructions from the [Mainnet Deployment Guide](/mine-hnt/validators/mainnet/deployment-guide).
