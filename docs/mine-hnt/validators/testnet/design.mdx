A few things are slightly modified from what will eventually be Mainnet.
Specifically:

- Developers need Testnet Network Tokens (TNT) to stake test validator nodes.
  You can get them [via the Faucet](https://faucet.helium.wtf) but, before you
  do that, read the
  [Validator Deployment Guide](/mine-hnt/validators/testnet/deployment-guide) so
  you know how to use them.
- The Testnet Consensus Group will be sized dynamically based on the number of
  active testnet participants.
- The cooldown period - defined as the number of blocks after unstaking when the
  validator node doesn't earn rewards, and the stake is returned to the owner's
  wallet - is shortened to 180 blocks (or approximately 3 hours). On Mainnet
  this period will be 250,000 blocks (or approximately 5.8 months).
