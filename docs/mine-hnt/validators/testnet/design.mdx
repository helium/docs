There are a few important distinctions between Testnet and Mainnet. Specifically:

- Developers need Testnet Network Tokens (TNT) to stake test validator nodes. You can get them
  [via the Faucet](https://faucet.helium.wtf) but, before you do that, read the
  [Validator Deployment Guide](/mine-hnt/validators/testnet/deployment-guide) so you know how to use
  them.
- The Testnet Consensus Group will be sized dynamically based on the number of active Testnet
  participants.
- The cooldown period - defined as the number of blocks after unstaking when the validator node
  doesn't earn rewards, and the stake is returned to the owner's wallet - is shortened to 180 blocks
  (or approximately 3 hours). On Mainnet this period is 250,000 blocks (or approximately 5.8
  months).
