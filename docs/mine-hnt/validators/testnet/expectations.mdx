As Validators are playing an important role in the expansion, stability and success of the Helium
network, it's important to set expectations for running a Validator, especially on the Testnet, 
where critical changes are often tested.

In participating in Testnet, the expectations are that you will:

- Join the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) server to take part in the real-time
  Validator development. Participate in the
  [#validator](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/857353417739730954) channel, but
  more importantly subscribe to alerts in
  [#validators-announcements](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/816788105511305236).
  [#validators-announcements](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/816788105511305236)
  will provide you with important, timely information for upgrades and feedback during this process.
- Be attentive to upgrade the Validator software when requested through
  [#validators-announcements](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/816788105511305236).
  This may include tasks that will require you to delete & re-stake your Validator instance, or
  perform other tasks that will assist the team in bringing the best product to the network.
- Be proficient in command-line driven linux-based operating systems, comfortable working with cloud
  based service providers (AWS, Azure, Linode, DigitalOcean, or GCP, etc.), comfortable with working
  with firewall rules / NAT and other basic networking components, and experienced in working with
  docker images and controls.

The Helium team as well as the greater Helium community is continually attemping to make this
process as clear and easy to understand as possible.
