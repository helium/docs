Perform the following test cases to help with testing:

* Set up a wallet
* Set up a validator node
* Stake testnet network tokens (TNT) 
* Observe wallet receives rewards
* Unstake TNT, observe:
    * no longer in consensus group
    * no longer receiving rewards
* Take validator offline
    * prior to consensus group
    * during consensus group
* Restake owner wallet
* Transfer ownership of stake to different validator node (same wallet, different wallet)
* Set up wallet tied to multiple validator nodes
