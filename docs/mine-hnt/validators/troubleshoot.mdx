# Troubleshooting

There is a ```#validator``` [Discord](https://discord.gg/helium)  channel available to reach other testnet participants. Also use this channel to share feedback and report issues.

## View logs
This is always helpful to get an idea of what's going on:

```docker exec validator tail -F /var/log/console.log```

## Compromised server
If you find that the server has been compromised just wipe it (save the blocks to avoid having to resync the entire blockchain), close the hole, stand up a new validator and then transfer the stake to it.

## Syncing to the blockchain
Syncing to the blockchain could be impacted for the following reasons:
* slow internet connection
* your validator is disconnecting
* you just launched an AMI instance (if using AWS)
