**NOTE**: If you build the Validator from source, the paths below may be
different for you. For the following Docker example, `/var/data` is inside the
docker container which is mapped to your `validator_data` directory on the host
system and `validator_data` is in your $HOME directory. It is also assumed that
you've added `alias miner='docker exec validator miner'` to `~/.bashrc`.

# Troubleshooting

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

There is a `#validator` [Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) channel available
to reach other validator participants. Also use this channel to share feedback
and report issues.

## Confirm you are running the latest Validator version

Upgrade instructions can be found
[here](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/mainnet/deployment-guide/#:~:text=a%20timely%20manner.-,Upgrade%20your%20Docker%20container,-To%20do%20manual)
as well as the link to the latest miner tag.

## View logs

- Tailing the `console.log` is always helpful to get an idea of what's going on.
  Assuming your data is mounted at `$HOME/validator_data`

  - Run: `tail -f $HOME/validator_data/log/console.log`

- This can be run directly on the Docker container as well:
  - `docker exec validator tail -f /var/data/log/console.log`

## Validator stuck at a block

If your validator appears to be stuck at a particular block and is no longer
syncing, start with [Basic troubleshooting](#basic-troubleshooting). If this
does not fix your issue, you can follow the directions under
[Validator low disk space](#validator-low-disk-space) to reset the validator.

## Basic troubleshooting

If you haven't already done so, confirm you have plenty of free disk space, DNS
resolution is working properly, you can ping remote servers, etc.

## Compromised server

If you find that the server has been compromised, wipe it and close the hole or
stand up a new validator,
[Grab the latest blessed snapshot from Helium](#grab-the-latest-blessed-snapshot-from-helium),
and then transfer the stake to it.

## Syncing to the blockchain

Syncing to the blockchain could be impacted for the following reasons:

- slow internet connection
- your validator is disconnecting
- you just launched an AMI instance (if using AWS)

## Confirm Light Hotspot ports are open remotely

To check if your ports are open on the validator you will need a machine on a
completely seperate network from the host that you have chosen to test.

If you have a Windows machine you can use Powershell to test the port by using
`Test-NetConnection <ip> -Port 8080`.

```
   ComputerName     : <ip>
   RemoteAddress    : <ip>
   RemotePort       : 8080
   InterfaceAlias   : vEthernet (New Virtual Switch)
   SourceAddress    : <local ip>
   TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

If you have a Linux Computer you can use the CLI and `nc` to test the port by
using `nc -zv -w 2 <ip> 8080`

```
   Connection to 23.100.120.236 8080 port [tcp/http-alt] succeeded!
```

:::tip This also works for your Validator 2154 port, just swap it in for the
8080 above! :::

## Check block absorb times

- Run
  `tail -n 500 -f $HOME/validator_data/log/console.log | grep -E 'add_block|validation took'`
  and monitor it for several minutes to confirm blocks are being absorbed.
  - The fastest validators have an average `validation took` time below 1,000ms.
    Absorb times higher than 3,000-5,000ms are not out of the norm, but
    consistently higher absorb times can indicate an issue with your Internet
    connectivity, disk or CPU speed. Absorb times approaching 60 seconds may
    prevent your validator from catching up to the tip of the chain, as new
    blocks are created approximately every 60s.
  - Note: If you just loaded a snapshot or upgraded the miner version, absorb
    times may be higher than usual, so wait several hours before determining
    your average absorb time.

## Validator low disk space

- If your validator is operatinging properly but is running low on disk space
  and you cannot/do not want to increase the disk space, it is safe to delete
  everything under the `$HOME/validator_data` **EXCEPT** for
  `$HOME/validator_data/miner` where your `swarm_key` is located.
- This is also a good time to backup your `swarm_key` if you haven't already.
- You can also leave the `blockchain_swarm` directory which contains the peer
  book, which will prevent your validator from needing to rebuild it. It is,
  however, safe to remove the `blockchain_swarm` directory, if your validator
  has been having issues and you want to start from scratch.
- Deleting this data will also require you to load a snapshot and resync to the
  tip of the chain. If your validator height is already at or above the latest
  available snapshot height, as shown by `miner info height`, it is to your
  benefit to first create a snapshot by running
  `miner snapshot take filenamehere` so that you can load the snapshot after
  freeing up disk space. Snapshot files are currently ~400MB in size, so you'll
  need at least that much free space in order to run the command, while the
  validator is still running.
- If your current block height is behind the latest snapshot or if you don't
  have enough free space to create your own, follow the steps in the next
  section to download and load the latest snapshot, after completing this
  section.
- Stop your docker validator container or systemd service, remove all the
  files/directories noted above
- Run `systemctl set-environment LOAD_SNAPSHOT=0` to disable automatically
  loading of snapshots (may require sudo).
- Start the docker validator containter or systemd service.
- Follow the steps to
  [Grab the latest blessed snapshot from Helium](#grab-the-latest-blessed-snapshot-from-helium).

## Grab the latest blessed snapshot from Helium

Helium hosts snapshots for download for the convenience of syncing validators.
You may download snapshot by following these steps:

- First determine the height of the snapshot you would like to download:
  - The list of latest snapshots which have been agreed upon by the Consensus
    Group is available from the API at
    [https://api.helium.io/v1/snapshots](https://api.helium.io/v1/snapshots)
  - Additionally, the latest manually blessed snapshot used by hotspots to sync
    from is available at
    [https://snapshots.helium.wtf/mainnet/latest-snap.json](https://snapshots.helium.wtf/mainnet/latest-snap.json).
    Note: this link may include snapshots generated by Helium or the Helium ETL
    that were not agreed upon by the Consensus Group and may not have been
    tested to work on validators.
- Choose the block height you want to start from and download the compressed
  version of this snapshot from Helium (Note the .gz extension):
  - `curl -O https://snapshots.helium.wtf/mainnet/snap-<height>.gz`
- Move that file into your `validator_data` directory.
- Load snapshot from the file you curl'd:
  `miner snapshot load /var/data/snap-<height>.gz`. This command expects an
  absolute path to the snapshot file.
  - This command may return error:
    `RPC to 'val_miner@127.0.0.1' failed: timeout` but the snapshot load
    actually continues to run in the background.
  - You can confirm that the snapshot load has completed by running
    `miner info height` every few minutes until it successfully shows a block
    height >= the snapshot height you loaded. You can then move on to the next
    step.
  - If you receive this error during when running the load command
    `{{{badmatch, {error,enoent}}`, it is likely due to the validator not
    finding the snapshot file in the directory you specified after the load
    command. The `/var/data/` directory is the default location within the
    docker container that you mapped to a directory on your host machine via
    `--mount type=bind,source=$HOME/validator_data,target=/var/data` or via
    `volumes: - $HOME/validator_data:/var/data` in your docker-compose.yaml
    file, if you followed the default installation instructions. Even if you did
    not use the default `$HOME/validator` path, you should still specify
    `/var/data/snap-<height>` after the load command and ensure that you placed
    the snapshot file in the `$HOME/validator` directory on the host machine, or
    in whichever source directory on the host that you map to `/var/data` when
    you start the docker container.
- Run `systemctl unset-environment LOAD_SNAPSHOT` to enable automatic loading of
  snapshots (may require sudo).
- Run `miner info height` every few minutes to confirm your block height is
  increasing. If you receive an error when running this command, the snapshot is
  most likely still loading. Wait a few minutes and try again.
- Confirm sync state is `active` via `miner repair sync_state`.
  - If not active, you can resume transaction syncing via
    `miner repair sync_resume`.
- [Check your block absorb times](#check-block-absorb-times)

## Grab a snapshot from another Validator

**Make sure you trust the Validator that you take your snapshot from,
shenanigans could ensue! This an advanced procedure use with caution!**

- On the source Validator run `miner info p2p_status`.
- Temporarily pause transaction sync via `miner repair sync_pause`.
- Cancel any in-progress transaction sync via `miner repair sync_cancel`.
- On the source Validator take a snapshot via
  `miner snapshot take /var/data/snap-<height>` using the height you determined
  from the first step.
- On the source Validator resume transaction syncing via
  `miner repair sync_resume`.
- Move the `/var/data/snap-<height>` file into the `validator_data` directory on
  the destination Validator.
- Load snapshot from the file you copied to the destination validator:
  `miner snapshot load /var/data/snap-<height>`. This command expects an
  absolute path to the snapshot file.
  - This command may return error:
    `RPC to 'val_miner@127.0.0.1' failed: timeout` but the snapshot load
    actually continues to run in the background.
  - You can confirm that the snapshot load has completed by running
    `miner info height` every few minutes until it successfully shows a block
    height >= the snapshot height you loaded. You can then move on to the next
    step.
- Confirm sync state is `active` via `miner repair sync_state`.
  - If not active, you can resume transaction syncing via
    `miner repair sync_resume`.
- Run `miner info height` every few minutes to confirm your block height is
  increasing.

## Performance and DKG Penalties

If you aren't yet familiar with the penalty system, check out
[Validator Penalties and Impact on Rewards](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/penalties/).

Low-grade Performance and DKG penalties are very noisy and difficult to
troubleshoot.

Based on early data, it appears that if your validator has penalties where the
sum (Performance + DKG) is less than (Tenure), your validator is performant
in-line with expectations.

The most common cause of Perf/DKG penalties is bad luck (due to bad peers or
otherwise).

A few other penalty root causes exist, each requiring detailed monitoring
capabilities to troubleshoot.

For the time/blocks when your validator accrued penalties, check your metrics
dashboard (e.g., Grafana).

- CPU steal: was this spiking when you were in the CG? Is this at an elevated
  level generally (<1% is normal)? If regularly high, change hosting providers.
- Internet connectivity issues: did rate of network ingress / egress plateau or
  fall off while in consensus group? Check if your network usage is throttled.
- Slow disk write speeds: do your disk write speeds exceed 4ms/op (not a fixed
  line, just a level where "you could get dinged")? See if you can improve disk
  quality.
- Other metrics: memory usage, disk volume, disk i/o, write latency

If you don't have a metrics dashboard and think a non-luck element may have
caused your penalty, please set up metrics monitoring.

Two options are
[Tedder's miner_exporter](https://github.com/tedder/miner_exporter) and the
[PaulVMo miner_exporter fork](https://github.com/PaulVMo/miner_exporter), which
can be used in conjunction with Grafana (and Prometheus's built-in
node_exporter) for detailed validator monitoring.

Baselining your instance via command line tools is also documented here
