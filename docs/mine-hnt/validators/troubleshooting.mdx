# Troubleshooting

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

There is a ```#validator``` [Discord](https://discord.gg/helium)  channel available to reach other validator participants. Also use this channel to share feedback and report issues.

## View logs
Tailing the `console.log` is always helpful to get an idea of what's going on. Assuming your data is mounted at `~/validator_data`, run:

```tail -f ~/validator_data/log/console.log```

This can be run directly on the Docker container as well:

```docker exec validator tail -f /var/data/log/console.log```


## Compromised server
If you find that the server has been compromised just wipe it (save the blocks to avoid having to resync the entire blockchain), close the hole, stand up a new validator and then transfer the stake to it.


## Syncing to the blockchain
Syncing to the blockchain could be impacted for the following reasons:
* slow internet connection
* your validator is disconnecting
* you just launched an AMI instance (if using AWS)


## Validator stuck at a block
If your validator appears to be stuck at a particular block and no longer syncing, you may need to take manual action for your validator to make progress.

1. Reset the validator. You can reference this [testnet step](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/testnet/deployment-guide/#steps-to-get-back-on-the-current-chain) for commands.


## Performance and DKG Penalties
If you aren't yet familiar with the penalty system, check out [Validator Penalties and Impact on Rewards](https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/penalties/).

Low-grade Performance and DKG penalties are very noisy and difficult to troubleshoot.

Based on early data, it appears that if your validator has penalties where the sum (Performance + DKG) is less than (Tenure), your validator is performant in-line with expectations.

The most common cause of Perf/DKG penalties is bad luck (due to bad peers or otherwise).

A few other penalty root causes exist, each requiring detailed monitoring capabilities to troubleshoot.

For the time/blocks when your validator accrued penalties, check your metrics dashboard (e.g., Grafana)
* CPU steal: was this spiking when you were in the CG? Is this at an elevated level generally (<1% is normal)? If regularly high, change hosting providers.
* Internet connectivity issues: did rate of network ingress / egress plateau or fall off while in consensus group? Check if your network usage is throttled.
* Slow disk write speeds: do your disk write speeds exceed 4ms/op (not a fixed line, just a level where "you could get dinged")? See if you can improve disk quality.
* Other metrics: memory usage, disk volume, disk i/o, write latency

If you don't have a metrics dashboard and think a non-luck element may have caused your penalty, please set up metrics monitoring.

One option is [Tedder's miner_exporter](https://github.com/tedder/miner_exporter), which can be used in conjunction with Grafana (and Prometheus's built-in node_exporter) for detailed validator monitoring.
