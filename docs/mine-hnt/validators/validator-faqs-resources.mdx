# FAQs, Resources, and Providers

## FAQs 

**How much HNT does it require to stake and become a Validator?**

10,000 HNT. 

**What’s the minimum number of Validators needed to go to mainnet?** 

The current proposal is 100 with no maximum number of Validators that can participate. We will activate a separate chain variable when we reach the proposed minimum which will enable Consensus Group election from the Validator pool. 

**What is the expect APY of running Helium Validator?**

It depends on the number of Validators and how often a Validator is randomly chosen to participate in the consensus group. Validators split the Consensus Group reward, [which is 6% of all HNT mined](/blockchain/mining/#mining-and-token-rewards).

The community has produced several models which should be instructive. Please do your own analysis before deciding to stake.

* [Helium Validator Rewards Forecasting with Validator Ramp Calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E4XLpF-a3xo3ZtNpJzd9g6EcuMZ1nSKKvtmKy_LVjhE/edit#gid=1705424601)


**Is there a Validator cap?**

No. 

**How long is the cooldown/unbonding period (the length of time the staking amount is locked)? Do I earn $HNT after my stake is unbonded?**

If a wallet decides to unstake a Validator, the current proposal is for a 250,000 block unbonding / cooldown period (which is approximately 5 months). Once a stake is unbonded, it no longer earns $HNT. 


**Is overstaking permitted? If so, what’s the benefit?**

Initially there will be no overstaking. We'll decide later, via the HIP process, what kind of overstaking the network should allow and what it will mean for election into the Consensus Group and ultimately rewards.
