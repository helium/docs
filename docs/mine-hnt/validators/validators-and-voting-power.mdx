# Validators and Voting Power

The Helium Foundation is making progress in implementing HIP 70 and migrating our L1 to Solana.
Check out the [Solana Transition AMAs](https://twitter.com/HeliumFndn/status/1598361332520132608)
hosted on Twitter Spaces for the most up-to-date progress on the L1 transition.

Validators remain critical for the ongoing operation of the Helium Network and continue to earn HNT
rewards for their role in supporting the Helium ecosystem until the L1 transition is complete.

Validators currently maintain the network and provide vital operations, including issuing
challenges, validating transactions, and producing blocks from which all network participants
benefit. One of the impacts of the passing of HIP 70 and transitioning L1 is that the role
Validators play as we know it today will no longer be required, and Validators will be sunset by the
end of Q1 2023 after the transition is complete.

Validators that remain staked receive new vote escrowed tokens (veHNT) based on their staked HNT
amount and their lock-up period. Post-migration, veHNT will be the only way to vote in the Helium
network. Holding veHNT means you, the wallet holder, has the opportunity to influence the future of
the network, and the more voting weight you have, the more influence you can use. Vote escrowed
tokens will be used to vote in DAO and subDAO governance and open a world of opportunities for
on-chain voting and voting power delegation.

## Key Take Aways

- Until the L1 transition is complete, staked Validators will continue to earn HNT rewards for block
  production.
- veHNT gives holders voting rights to determine the future of the Helium Network.
- After the migration, anyone can stake HNT to veHNT. No more 10,000 HNT minimum.
- Validator operators can decide to remain staked and receive veHNT or unstake and remain in
  cool-down until the completion of the L1 migration.
- Validators who remain staked receive a 3x veHNT bonus for staked HNT, and their HNT remains locked
  up for the minimum six-month period.
- veHNT holders will earn MOBILE or IOT tokens depending on which Helium subDAO they delegate their
  veHNT.
- After the minimum lockup period, HNT releases to the owner’s wallet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Is veHNT?

veHNT represents the voting power of the Helium network.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking their HNT on chain for a specified
period in exchange for voting rights and power in the HeliumDAO. This was defined in
[HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336). Additionally, this provides other benefits,
such as earning MOBILE or IOT tokens, if the holder stakes to those subDAOs, respectively. After the
lock-up period ends, the same amount of HNT releases in the owner’s wallet and is now transferable,
if needed.

### What Was Staked HNT?

Following [HIP 25](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0025-validators.md), Validator operators
staked 10,000 HNT into a Validator. HNT holders could stake multiple validators if they chose to do
so. The work of block production moved to Validator nodes and those elected periodicaly into the
Consensus Group receive 6% of HNT emissions as a reward for block production.

All HNT holders, including Validator stakers, could vote on Helium HIPs as staked and unstaked HNT
was treated the same. HNT holders who elected to join a Validator pool were not able to decide
personally on voting as the pool operator controlled their voting power. In all known cases, pool
operators did not participate in governance.


### What Are the Staking Rewards?

Currently, Validators serve two roles in the network, block production and creating
Proof-of-Coverage challenges. For block production, Validators earn 6% of emissions when they are
elected to the Consensus Group. Validators are continuously generating PoC challenges and earn 0.85%
of emissions for this role. Thus, staking and operating a Validator roughly earns 6.85% of total HNT
emissions today.

## How Will Staking Rewards Change?

In the near term, the Challenger role will be removed from Validators as Hotspots begin to beacon
independently of challenges. This a part of HIP 70 and off-chain PoC and is documented elsewhere but
the direct impact is that Validators will be doing less work. The PoC Challenger rewards pool will
be returned to Hotspots. 

After HIP 70's L1 migration is implemented, the existing Validators will no longer be producing 
blocks for the Helium network and will no longer receive HNT rewards. As their staked HNT will be
converted to veHNT, these holders will have the option to delegate to specific subDAOs. At this 
time, the IOT and MOBILE subDAO have a 6% token emission pool for veHNT stakers.

After HIP 51-53 are implemented, all the subDAOs combined will get non-HST emissions of HNT. At this
time this is 68% of emitted HNT and increases to 69% at the next yearly emissions change in August
of this year. This emissions curve changes annually such that the subDAOs eventually receive 85% of
emissions.

### What Are The Benefits of Staking HNT after the subDAOs Are Launched?

After the Solana migration, stakers can use their staked veHNT to vote on proposals in the HeliumDAO
and help the DAO make collective decisions, influencing the future of the network.

Stakers will additionally be able to delegate veHNT to a subDAO for token rewards. Delegating veHNT
to a subDAO will count towards the DAO Utility Score, the ‘V’ value referenced in HIP 51. The higher
the DAO Utility Score, the higher the proportion of HNT earned by the individual subDAO treasury
each epoch.

### What Happens to HNT Previously Staked in a Pool?

Check with the vendor managing your staking pool for more detailed information about your staking
pool's decision.

:::warning

The Helium Foundation is neither responsible for nor manages the status of Validator staking pools.

:::

### What Happens if I Unstake Today?

If you unstake on October 15, 2022, for example, the expected release date is around January 9, 2023, assuming the cooldown period of 125,000 blocks and an average block time of 60 seconds. This also assumes the L1 chain is still running on that date. Based on information provided since September 2022 around the time of the vote and updates since then, the core developers expect that block production on the Helium L1 will discontinue sometime in early Q1 2023 when the implemention of HIP 70 is complete.

Any HNT that is in cooldown at the snapshot taken before the data migration to the new L1 will be
converted to veHNT with a staking release date of 6 months as described in HIP 70. Any HNT that is
still staked will also automatically convert to veHNT with a 6 month staking release date.

All veHNT that is still staked at the time of the snapshot will receive a 3x Voting Weight
multiplier during the 6-month lock-up as a reward for ongoing staking in the network.

### Where Does My HNT Go if I Stake veHNT?

If you stake your HNT for veHNT, your HNT will become veHNT and will remain completely in your
wallet's custody.

At the end of the lock-up period, you will receive HNT back to your wallet 1:1 for the HNT you
staked.

### What Is a “Lock Up” Period?

You will incur a lock-up period when you stake your HNT for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 6
and 48 months with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help incentivize long term holders of HNT and deter short term speculators and/or
those with shorter term interests in the governance of the network.

### What is Voting Power?

Voting power is the weight of your vote towards decisions made by the DAO or subDAO. The more veHNT
you have, the more weight your vote has.

You can only increase your voting power by staking more HNT or by extending an existing veHNT stake
for a longer period.

### How to Choose a subDAO to Stake?

[HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
defines that all subDAOs return a maximum of 6% of their earnings to their veHNT delegators and is
designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subDAOs so that no subDAO can buy their way
to a higher DAO Utility score.

Returns can be lower than 6% if the subDAO votes to provide a lower token return in return for other
benefits or similar.

As more veHNT is delegated to a subDAO, the DAO Utility Score improves (among other factors as
defined in HIP 51). This drives greater earnings of HNT for the subDAO.

We expect that as more veHNT holders delegate to a particular subDAO, individual holder earnings
will reduce the amount of net subDAO token earnings as delegators are sharing the 6% subDAO token
emissions. 

### How Will Staking Work By Using veHNT?

Anyone can stake ANY amount of HNT for a period of 6 months to 4 years. You choose your unstaking
date at the time of lock-up. The HNT staked is exchanged for veHNT which provides two benefits:

- Voting in the Helium DAO on new subDAO proposals.
- Participating in Governance of the HNT DAO.

Anyone can delegate veHNT to a subDAO and this is one component of a subDAO's Utility Score. 
Delegating veHNT to a subDAO allows the holder to proportionally earn subDAO token rewards based on
the subDAOs rules.

For example: If I delegate some veHNT to MOBILE subDAO, I proportionally earn MOBILE rewards
allocated to veHNT stakers.

The Helium network encourages your long-term participation in voting and governance. Those that
stake HNT for 6 months, will recieve an exchange of 1:1 HNT to veHNT. Those that stake veHNT for 48
months will recieve an exchange of 1:100 HNT to veHNT. Any time period in between that will be
treated on a linear scale from 1 to 100.

For example: I choose to lock up 10 HNT for 6 months. I recieve 10 veHNT. If I choose to unstake
immediately, after 6 months, my veHNT decays to my 10 HNT unlocks and is available to me for use in
my wallet.

### How Can I Obtain veHNT?

Staking HNT for veHNT will be done on [Realms](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/realms). This is not
available today.

Check out a [DAO beta view](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/dao/MNGO) on Realms today.

### Is There a Staking "Genesis" Period?

For the first 7 days, there will be a 3x bonus for HNT holders new veHNT stakers. Only during the 7
day ”genesis” period, new stakers receive 3x the veHNT they would normally receive for staking.

For example: Staking 10 HNT for 6 months gets 30 veHNT (10x1x3) that decays from 30 to 0 veHNT at
the end of the staking period and 10 HNT is returned to the wallet.

Staking 20 HNT for 24 months gets around 2598 veHNT (20x43.3x3) and these decay to 60 veHNT at 6
months and then remain at 60 veHNT that decays to 0 veHNT at the end of the last month of the
staking period and 20 HNT is returned to the wallet.

### Will I Earn HNT by Staking For veHNT?

No. HNT stakers will not actually earn any more HNT than they stake.

HNT staked to veHNT will not earn more HNT at the end of the staking period. When you stake 1 HNT to
1 veHNT for your set lock-up period, you will recieve the same amount of HNT back, at the end of the
lock-up period.

However, when you stake HNT into veHNT you are allowed to delegate your veHNT into one or more
subDAOs (such as IOT and/or MOBILE) and the subDAOs allocate up to 6% of their token emissions to
the veHNT owners delegating to that subDAO.

For example: When you delegate your veHNT to the IOT subDAO, you recieve IOT every epoch directly
into your Helium Wallet. This IOT can then be burned at the IOT subDAO treasury for HNT if you
choose or you may hold your IOT tokens.

### How Do I Stake for veHNT After HIP 51 and 70 Are Implemented?

1. To stake, transfer HNT into your Helium Wallet App (black icon app). Perform this step if you do
   not already have HNT in your wallet.
2. Using the Helium Wallet App, stake HNT into veHNT, and define the period of lock-up. The
   granularity of selection will likely be in blocks.
3. Using the Helium Wallet App, delegate that veHNT into one or more existing subDAOs. You may have
   to complete several transactions depending on how many subDAOs you are delegating to.
4. Your delegated HNT will count towards the subDAOs Utility Score and provide increased HNT
   earnings in the subDAO's treasury per epoch.

This process should be farily simple in the black wallet app. More instructions will be provided as
we get closer to the Solana migration.

All staking and vote escrow delegation operations will be performed within a Solana compatible
Wallet App or the Helium wallet CLI. The black Helium Wallet app will be Solana compatible.

- Staking HNT to veHNT
- Increasing the veHNT staking period for existing veHNT
- Delegating veHNT to a subDAO
- Voting for HNT governance
- Voting for subDAO governance
- Receiving the subDAO token that your veHNT is delegated into

### Do I Have to Delegate My veHNT to a subDAO?

No. You can hold your veHNT as is, or delegate to a subDAO at any time.

Note: Once you delegate veHNT, you cannot un-delegate. You must wait for the lock-up period to end.

### How Granular Is The veHNT Linear Decrease?

The decay in the veHNT quantity in a wallet is granulated per epoch, and the veHNT delegated to a
subDAo decays at the same rate.

A 48 month lock-in period has approximately 42 (48-6 months) x 30 (days) x 48 epochs (30 mins) =
60,480 linear steps between 100 veHNT and 1 veHNT.

After 1 epoch has passed after staking a single 1 HNT for 48 months the quantity of veHNT in the
wallet will decay from 100 veHNT to 99.998347 veHNT. This will decrease by this very small amount
every 30 mins over the 42 months till it reaches 1 veHNT and remains at 1 veHNT for 6 months.

A table showing the approximate HNT to veHNT multiplier for each month of starting a stake or veHNT
a stake has decayed to. Delegating veHNT to a subDAO or veDNT staking decays at the same rates.

### Can I Increase My Staking Period At Any Time?

Yes. You can increase your staking period to the maxium of 48 months at any time. It will be
activated at the next epoch.

### Can I Decrease My Staking Period For Fast Access to My HNT and Take a Penalty?

No. You define your staking period at the time of staking and cannot unstake for any reason.

### Can I Automate Re-staking?

This is being evaluated as the future default option for staking. This will not be available on day
1 on the Solana migration.

### Can I Transfer my veHNT or Any of The veDNTs, like veIOT or veMOBILE, to Someone Else?

No. veHNT and the like is fully non-transferable, and represents your voting power in the network.
It is not a token.

### How Do I Buy veHNT or Any of the veDNTs, Like veIOT or veMOBILE?

You cannot buy veHNT or any of the other veDNTs. It is not a token. veHNT can only be obtained by
staking HNT with a lock-up period. Likewise, you cannot buy veIOT or veMOBILE. veHNT and veDNT have
no price in the larger crypto markets.

### What Is the DAO Utility Score?

The Utility score is described in ([HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336)). Each new
sub-token of HNT, which are MOBILE and IOT (so far), have a utility score which mathematically
describes the proportion shared of HNT tokens distributed to them every epoch from the fixed amount
allocated to all subDAOs. The higher the utility score, the bigger the proportion of HNT emitted to
that subDAO’s treasury per epoch. A sub-token with a utility score of 100 would receive ⅔ of the
emitted HNT in an epoch, assuming the other token had a score of less than 100. But would receive ⅓
if the other token had a score of 200 Delegating veHNT to IOT or MOBILE increases the 'V' value in
the HIP 51 DAO Utility Score calculation. The two other ways the DAO Utility score can be increased
are:

1. The amount of data usage on the subDAO, i.e. the Data Credits burned. This increases the 'D'
   value in the score.
2. The Data Credits used to onboard the number of hotspots for that subDAO. This increases the 'A'
   value in the score.

### Will My subDAO Earnings Remain The Same Over The Time Period Lock-Up?

No, they are calculated and paid per epoch. They may increase when:

- More veHNT is delegated to your subDAO (your treasury gets more HNT)
- More hotspot onboarding fees are burned in your subDAO
- More data is transferred and burned in your subDAO

They may decrease when:

- More veHNT is delegated in your subDAO - your share is reduced
- More veHNT is delegated to other subDAOs - other treasuries get more HNT
- Your delegated veHNT decays over time
- More hotspot onboarding fees are burned in other subDAOs
- More data is transferred and burned in other subDAOs
