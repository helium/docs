The Helium Foundation is progressing in implementing HIP-70 and migrating our L1 to Solana. This
documentation on staking and lock-up is subject to updates and modifications before the migration
date.

:::info

Check out the [Solana Transition AMAs](https://twitter.com/HeliumFndn/status/1598361332520132608)
hosted on Twitter Spaces for the most up-to-date progress on the L1 transition.

:::

Validators were critical for the ongoing operation of the Helium Network and continued to earn HNT
rewards for their role in supporting the Helium ecosystem until the L1 transition completion.

Validators maintained the Network and provided vital operations, including validating transactions
and producing blocks from which all Network participants benefit. One of the impacts of the passing
of HIP-70 and transitioning L1 is that the role Validators play as we know it will no longer be
required, and Validators are sunsetted by the end of Q1 2023 after the transition is complete.

Validators who remained staked receive new vote escrowed tokens (veHNT) based on their staked HNT
amount and lock-up period. Post-migration, veHNT will be the only way to vote in the Helium Network.
Vote escrowed tokens will be used to vote in DAO and subDAO governance and open a world of
opportunities for on-chain voting and voting power delegation.

Holding veHNT means you, the wallet holder, have the opportunity to influence the future of the
Helium Network, and the more voting weight you have, the more influence you can use.

## Key Take Aways

- Until the L1 transition is completed, staked Validators continued to earn HNT rewards for block
  production.
- veHNT gives holders voting rights to determine the future of the Helium Network.
- Post migration, anyone can stake HNT to veHNT, and there will no longer be a 10,000 HNT minimum.
- Validator operators could decide to remain staked and receive veHNT or unstake and remain in
  cooldown until the completion of the L1 migration.
- Validators who remain staked receive a 3x veHNT bonus for staked HNT, and their HNT remains locked
  up for the a six-month period as defined in HIP 51.
- veHNT holders will earn MOBILE or IOT tokens depending on which Helium subDAO they delegate their
  veHNT.
- After the minimum lock-up period, HNT releases to the owner's wallet after staking cooldown is
  selected.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Is veHNT?

veHNT represents the voting power of the Helium Network.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking their HNT on-chain for a specified
period in exchange for voting rights and voting power in the HeliumDAO as defined in
[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336).

Additionally, this provides other benefits, such as earning MOBILE or IOT tokens, if the holder
delegates their veHNT to those subDAOs, respectively. After the lock-up period ends, the same amount
of HNT is released back to the owner's wallet and is now transferable, if needed.

### What Was Staked HNT?

Following [HIP-25](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0025-validators.md), Validator operators
staked 10,000 HNT into a Validator Node. HNT holders could stake multiple Validators if they chose
to do so. The work of block production moved to Validator nodes, and those elected periodically into
the Consensus Group received 6% of HNT emissions as a reward for block production.

All HNT holders, including Validator stakers, could vote on Helium HIPs as staked and unstaked HNT
are equally weighted in voting the same. However, HNT holders who elected to join a Validator pool
could not decide personally on voting as the pool operator controlled their voting power. In all
known cases, pool operators did not participate in governance.

### What were the Staking Rewards?

Validators served two roles in the Network, block production and creating and validating
Proof-of-Coverage challenges. Validators earned 6% of emissions for block production when elected to
the Consensus Group and 0.85% for Proof-of-Coverage challenges.

### How Will Staking Rewards Change?

As of 02/02/23, the Challenger role was removed from Validators as Hotspots begin to beacon
independently of be challenged. The PoC Challenger rewards pool has been returned to Hotspots.

After HIP-70's L1 migration is implemented, the existing Validators will no longer be producing
blocks for the Helium Network and will no longer receive HNT rewards. As their staked HNT will be
converted to veHNT, these holders can optionally delegate to specific subDAOs.

Currently, the IOT and MOBILE subDAO have a 6% token emission pool for veHNT stakers.

After HIP-51, HIP-52 and HIP-53 are implemented, all the subDAOs combined will receive the non-HST
emissions of HNT. At this time, this is 68% of emitted HNT and will increase to 69% at the next
yearly emissions change in August 2023. This emissions curve changes annually such that the subDAOs
eventually receive 85% of all future HNT emissions.

### What Are The Benefits of Staking HNT after the subDAOs Are Launched?

After the Solana migration, stakers can use their staked veHNT to vote on proposals in the HeliumDAO
and help the DAO make collective decisions, influencing the future of the Network.

Stakers will additionally be able to delegate veHNT to a subDAO for token rewards. Delegating veHNT
to a subDAO will count towards the DAO Utility Score, the `V` value referenced in
[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model).

:::note Utitily Score impacts HNT Proportion for a subDAO

The higher the DAO Utility Score in relation to the DAO Utility score of other SubDAOs, the higher
the proportion of HNT earned by the individual subDAO treasury each epoch.

:::

### What Happens to HNT Previously Staked in a Pool?

Check with the vendor managing your staking pool for more detailed information about your staking
pool's decision.

:::caution As a Reminder

**The Helium Foundation is neither responsible for nor manages the status of Validator staking
pools.**

:::

### What Happens if I Unstake Today?

If a Validator unstaked on January 1st 2023, the expected release date is around March 27th, 2023.

This date assumes a cooldown period of 125,000 blocks with an average block time of 60 seconds, and
the L1 chain is still running on that date. The core developers expect that block production on the
Helium L1 will discontinue late march 2023 when the implementation of HIP-70 is complete.

Any HNT in cooldown at the time the snapshot is taken before the data migration to the new L1 will
be converted to veHNT with a staking release date of six months,
[as described in HIP-70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md#reduce-the-cooldown-period-of-staked-validators).
Any HNT still staked will automatically convert to veHNT with a six-month staking release date.

All veHNT still staked at the time of the snapshot will receive a 3x Voting Weight multiplier during
the 6-month lock-up as a reward for ongoing staking in the Network.

### Where Does My HNT Go if I Stake veHNT?

If you lock-up your HNT for veHNT, your HNT will become veHNT and remain entirely in your wallet's
custody. veHNT ownership is represented by a non transferable Solana NFT held in your wallet. At the
end of the lock-up period, you will receive HNT back to your wallet 1:1 for the HNT you staked.

### What Is a "Lock-Up" Period?

A lock-up period is a window of time when users are not allowed to transfer their HNT.

You will incur a lock-up period when you stake your HNT for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 1
day and 48 months selectable in days but with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help incentivize long-term holders of HNT and deter short-term speculators and those
with shorter-term interests in the governance of the Network.

### What is Voting Power?

Voting power is the weight of your vote towards decisions made by the DAO or subDAO. The more veHNT
you have, the more weight your vote has.

You can only increase your voting power by staking more HNT or extending an existing veHNT lock-up
period for longer.

### How to Choose a subDAO to Stake?

[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
defines that all subDAOs return a maximum of 6% of their earnings to their veHNT delegators and is
designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subDAOs so that no subDAO can buy their way
to a higher DAO Utility score.

Returns can be lower than 6% in subDAO tokens if the subDAO votes to provide a lower token return in
return for other benefits or similar.

As more veHNT is delegated to a subDAO, the DAO Utility Score improves, among other factors defined
in HIP-51, which drives greater earnings of HNT for the subDAO.

As more veHNT holders delegate to a particular subDAO, individual holder earnings will reduce the
amount of net subDAO token earnings as delegators share the 6% subDAO token emissions.

The more veHNT delegated to a subDAO the more the subDAO Utility score increases and the more HNT
the subDAO gets at each epoch improving the HNT/subDAO Token ratio. But the more veHNT delegated,
the more veHNT holders the 6% will have to be shared between.

### How Will Staking Work By Using veHNT?

Anyone can stake any amount of HNT and lock it up for 1 day to 1461 days ( 48 months). You choose
your unstaking date at the time of lock-up or deciding to keep it on a rolling lock-up period,
called "constant lock-up" before initiating the start or the veHNT decay process. The HNT staked is
exchanged for veHNT, which provides two benefits:

- Voting in the Helium DAO on new subDAO proposals and Participating in the Governance.
- Receiving an income if the veHNT is delegated to a subDAO.

Anyone can delegate veHNT to a subDAO, it's one component of a subDAO's Utility Score. Delegating
veHNT to a subDAO allows the holder to earn subDAO token rewards proportionally based on the subDAOs
rules.

> For example: If I delegate some veHNT to MOBILE subDAO, I proportionally earn MOBILE rewards
> allocated to veHNT stakers.

The Helium Network encourages your long-term participation in voting and governance. Those who stake
HNT for 1 day will exchange 1:0.06844627 HNT to veHNT. Those that stake veHNT for 48 months will
receive an exchange of 1:100 HNT to veHNT. Any period in between will be treated on a linear scale
from 0.0684462 to 100.

> For example, I choose to lock-up 10 HNT for six months. I receive 125 veHNT. If I decide to
> unstake immediately, after six months, my veHNT decays to 0 until my 10 HNT unlocks and is
> available to me for use in my wallet.

An amount of locked-up veHNT is a Position and it is possible to own multiple Positions in your
wallet. Actions taken on locked-up veHNT like delegating, voting, lock-up periods are an all or
nothing option. If a veHNT owner would like to to recieve rewards from two SubDAOs then the veHNT
Position would need to be split into two Positions by transfering some veHNT to a send position
within the same wallet and then each position could delegate to different Positions. Similarly
wishing to extend the lock-up period on parts of a Position requires a similar split by transfer.

### How Can I Obtain veHNT?

Staking HNT for veHNT will be done on [Realms](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/realms).

:::note This is not available today.

Check out a [DAO beta view](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/dao/MNGO) on Realms today.

:::

### Is There a Staking "Genesis" Period?

For the first seven days after Helium's migration onto Solana, there will be a 3x multiplier bonus
for new veHNT stakers. This is called the "Landrush" multiplier.

New stakers are only eligible to receive this veHNT bonus during the initial seven-day Landrush
period. HNT staked after this period will receive veHNT at the normal rate with no multiplier.

This landrush period will end at 23:59:59 UTC time on 25th April 2023

For example:

> Staking 10 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of six months gets 375 veHNT
> (10x12.5x3) that if cooldown is selected decays from 375 to 0 veHNT at the end of the staking
> period, and 10 HNT is returned to the wallet.

> Staking 20 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of 24 months returns 3000 veHNT
> (20x50x3), and at the end of the staking period, 20 HNT is returned to the wallet.

Validator owners can also take advantage of the 7 day bonus period and get the 3x bonus reapplied if
they extend their default 6 month lock-up period. This 3x bonus will not apply to the later extended
period if they extend the lock-up further after the initial seven days, or veHNT is transfered to
another staking position after the 7 day period.

### Will I Earn HNT by Staking For veHNT?

**No.** HNT staked to veHNT will not earn more HNT, it will only return what they staked at the end
of their selected lock-up period.

However, when you stake HNT into veHNT, you can delegate your veHNT into one or more subDAOs (such
as IOT or MOBILE), and the subDAOs allocate up to 6% of their token emissions to the veHNT owners
delegating to that subDAO.

> For example: When you delegate your veHNT to the IOT subDAO, you receive IOT every epoch that is
> claimable in your Helium Wallet. If you choose, this IOT can then be burned at the IOT subDAO
> treasury for HNT, or you may hold your IOT tokens, or stake them into veIOT.

### How Do I Stake for veHNT After HIP-51 and HIP-70 Are Implemented?

1. If you do not already have HNT in your Helium Wallet, transfer HNT into your Helium Wallet to
   stake.
2. Using the Helium Wallet App/Realms, stake HNT into veHNT and define the lock-up period and if the
   decay cooldown period starts immediately or lock-up period is rolling with a decay countdown
   starting at a future date to be decided (default) The granularity of selection of lock-up period
   is in days.
3. Using the Helium Wallet App browser (Globe icon) access /Realms, delegate that veHNT into one or
   more existing subDAOs. You may have to complete several transactions depending on how many
   subDAOs you delegate to, or if you want different amounts delegated for different lock-up
   periods.
4. Your delegated HNT will count towards the subDAOs Utility Score and provide increased HNT
   deposits in the subDAO's treasury per epoch.

This process should be simple in the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). More
instructions will be provided on Realms usage as we get closer to the Solana migration.

The Helium Wallet App is Solana compatible. All staking and vote escrow delegation operations will
be performed within the Helium Wallet app browser and Realms

- Staking HNT to veHNT
- Increasing the veHNT staking period for existing veHNT
- Delegating veHNT to a subDAO
- Voting for HNT governance with veHNT
- Voting for subDAO governance with veIOT or veMOBILE

### How much veHNT will I get for each lock-up period?

The table below shows the approximate HNT to veHNT multiplier for example months of staking

This value is multiplied by 3x during the first 7 days after the Solana transition and this
multiplier lasts as long as the last lock-up period selected in the first 7 days after the solana
migration.

| Months staked | veHNT received |     | Months staked | veHNT received |
| :-----------: | :------------: | --- | :-----------: | :------------: |
|    1 week     |      0.5       |     |      12       |      25.0      |
|    2 weeks    |      1.0       |     |      15       |      31.2      |
|       1       |      2.0       |     |      18       |      37.5      |
|       2       |      4.1       |     |      21       |      43.7      |
|       3       |      6.2       |     |      24       |      50.0      |
|       4       |      8.3       |     |      27       |      56.2      |
|       5       |      10.4      |     |      30       |      62.5      |
|       6       |      12.5      |     |      33       |      68.7      |
|       7       |      14.5      |     |      36       |      75.0      |
|       8       |      16.6      |     |      39       |      81.2      |
|       9       |      18.7      |     |      42       |      87.5      |
|      10       |      20.8      |     |      45       |      93.7      |
|      11       |      22.9      |     |      48       |     100.0      |

### Do I Have to Delegate My veHNT to a subDAO?

No. You can hold your veHNT as is or delegate to a subDAO at any time.

:::note

Changing delegation is allowed, but any delegation changes within a Solana Epoch will void any
delegation rewards within that Epoch. A Solana Epoch is 24 hours long and starts and ends at
00:00:00 UTC time.

:::

### How Granular Is The veHNT Linear Decrease?

The veHNT decay countdown starts when initiated from the Wallet app/Realms, until then the veHNT in
the wallet remains a constant.

veHNT quantity decay is granulated per second even though the Epoch period is 24 hours.

It is the current delegated veHNT value at the start of an Epoch that is used for calculating the
subDAO utility score during the Epoch.

A 48-month lock-in period has approximately 1461 linear steps between 100 veHNT and 0 veHNT.

> 4 years x 365.25 days epochs per day = 1461 steps

After 1 day has passed after staking a single 1 HNT for 48 months, the quantity of veHNT in the
wallet will decay from 100 veHNT to 99.86311 veHNT. This decrease will recur linearly over all the
remaining 48 months until it hits zero.

### Can I Increase My Staking Lock-up Period At Any Time?

Yes. You can increase your lock-up period to the maximum of 48 months at any time, and each increase
activates at the start of the next epoch. If the veHNT is delegated you must undelegate, change the
period and redelegate and lose delegation rewards within that 24 hour Epoch. If those three actions
take longer than an epoch or are split over two epochs then delegation rewards are lost for two
Epochs.

### Can I Decrease My Staking Period For Fast Access to My HNT and Take a Penalty?

No. You define your lock-up period at the time of staking and cannot unstake or decrease the lock-up
period for any reason.

### Can I Automate Re-Staking?

Yes a constant rolling lock-up period will be the default option called Constant Lock-up. The decay
countdown start point will be positive action needed to start the lock-up cooldown period.

> Staking 10 HNT for 4 years will get approx 1000 veHNT and this will be a rolling 4 year period and
> will remain at 1000 veHNT until the decay countdown is activated and this will then decrease
> linearly over 4 years to 0 veHNT and the HNT is returned.

### Can I Transfer my veHNT or any of the veDNTs to Someone Else?

No. veHNT and the like are fully non-transferable and represent your voting power in the Network. It
is not a token.

### How Do I Buy veHNT or Any of the veDNTs?

You cannot buy veHNT, veIOT or veMOBILE. They are not a tradable tokens. veHNT can only be obtained
by staking HNT with a lock-up period. Likewise, for veIOT or veMOBILE.

veHNT and veDNTs have no price in the larger crypto markets.

### What Is the DAO Utility Score?

The DAO Utility score is described in [HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336)

Each new subDAO of HNT has a Utility Score that mathematically represents the proportion shared of
HNT tokens distributed to them every epoch from the fixed amount allocated to all subDAOs. This is
currently 68% until April 1st 2023. The higher the Utility Score, the more significant the
proportion of this 68% of HNT is emitted to that subDAO's treasury per epoch.

Delegating veHNT to IOT or MOBILE increases the `V` value in the
[HIP-51 DAO Utility Score](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
calculation.

The two other ways the DAO Utility score can be increased are:

1. The amount of data usage on the subDAO, i.e., the Data Credits burned. This increases the `D`
   value in the Utility Score.
2. The Data Credits used to onboard the number of Hotspots for that subDAO. This increases the `A`
   value in the Utility Score.

### Will My subDAO Earnings Remain The Same Over The Time Period Lock-Up?

No, they are calculated and paid to the lock-up position per epoch - daily. They may increase when:

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your treasury gets more HNT.
- More Hotspot onboarding fees are burned in the subDAO you delegated to.
- More data is transferred and burned in the subDAO you delegated to.

They may decrease when:

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your share is reduced
- More veHNT is delegated to other subDAOs - other treasuries get more HNT.
- Your delegated veHNT decays over time after you entered cooldown.
- More Hotspots are online in other subDAOs with a non zero onboarding fee.
- More data is transferred and burned in other subDAOs.

Thus it can be observed that delegating more or all of your veHNT to a specific subDAO has the
opportunity to both increase or decrease your subDAO earnings from delegation.
