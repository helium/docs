# Validators and Voting Power

The Helium Foundation is making progress in implementing HIP 70 and migrating our L1 to Solana.
Check out the
[Solana Transition AMAs](https://twitter.com/HeliumFndn/status/1598361332520132608?s=20&t=a5g0_g0ctlBfqlgUPzmCMQ)
hosted on Twitter Spaces for the most up-to-date progress on the L1 transition.

Validators remain critical for the ongoing operation of the Helium Network and continue to earn HNT
rewards for their role in supporting the Helium ecosystem until the L1 transition is complete.

Validators currently maintain the network and provide vital operations, including issuing
challenges, validating transactions, and building blocks from which all network participants
benefit. One of the impacts of the passing of HIP 70 and transitioning L1 is that the role
Validators play will no longer be required, and Validators will be sunset by the end of Q1 2023
after the transition is complete.

Validators that remain staked receive new vote escrowed tokens (veHNT) based on their staked HNT
amount and their lock-up period. Post-migration, veHNT will be the only way to vote in the Helium
network. Holding veHNT means you, or your pool, has the opportunity to influence the future of the
network, and the more voting weight you have, the more influence you can use. Vote escrowed tokens
will be used to vote in DAO and subDAO governance and open a world of opportunities for on-chain
voting and voting power delegation.

## Key Take Aways

- Until the L1 transition is complete, staked Validators will continue to earn HNT rewards for block
  production.
- veHNT gives holders voting rights to determine the future of the Helium Network.
- Validator operators can decide to remain staked and receive veHNT or unstake and remain in
  cool-down until the completion of the L1 migration.
- Validators who remain staked receive a 3x veHNT bonus for staked HNT, and their HNT remains locked
  up for the minimum six-month period.
- veHNT holders will earn MOBILE or IOT tokens depending on which Helium subDAO they delegate their
  veHNT.
- After the minimum lockup period, HNT releases to the owner’s wallet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Is veHNT?

veHNT represents the voting power of the Helium network.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking their HNT on chain from further
access for a specified period in exchange for voting rights and power in the HeliumDAO
([HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336)). Additionally, this provides other benefits,
such as earning MOBILE or IOT tokens. After the lock-up period ends, the locked up HNT releases to
the owner’s wallet.

### What Was Staked HNT?

Following [HIP 25](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0025-validators.md), Validator operators
staked 10,000 HNT, or multiples of 10,000 HNT, into a Validator or Validator group. The work of
Consensus Group creation moved to the Validator node type as an incentive to becoming a Validator,
and shifting a yearly average of 6% of HNT per year was to Validator operators.

Validator Operators could vote on Helium HIPs with HNT in their wallet or with the HNT in their own
managed staked Validators. HNT holders who elected to partially stake with a Validator pool operator
were not able to decide personally on voting; instead, the pool operator controlled their voting
power.

Currently staked validators receive the 6% of HNT allocated to the consensus group and the 0.85%
allocated to the Beacon Challengers. Thus staking token rewards is 6.85% of the total HNT emission
per epoch/day/month. This is fixed and unchanged until PoC is removed from earnings and the total
figure reduces to 6%. After HIP 51-53 are implemented, all the subDAOs combined will get 68% of
emitted HNT and the amount allocated to the vote escrowed tokens is a maximum of 6% of this 68%
across all subDAOs. So the new figure is 6% x 68% = 4.08% of the total HNT emission per
epoch/day/month. On 1st Aug 2023 the 68% figure increases by 1% to 69% and the amount issued for
veHNT increases proportionally to 4.14% This 69% further increases by 1% each year on August 1st
untill the max of 85% goes to the subDAOs and the amount issued for vote escrowed tokens increases
to 5.1% and stays at this value.

### So, If I'm a Validator, I Move From Roughly a Fixed 6% to a Fixed 4% Reward For Staking?

No. The 6% to validators always varied depending on the luck of consensus group membership and the
operational ability of the validator owner to maintain a high score and update status to be selected
for consensus. Individual validators earned more or less than 6%.

In the future with veHNT staking this 4% is shared to all the subDAOs and unless you perfectly match
your veHNT split delegated with the Utility Score split between the subDAOs, you will also earn more
or less than this 4%.

If you stake more proportionally in a subDAO than others, and it does better proportionally than the
other subDAOs for size/data rewards, your subDAO rewards amount will increase and its value against
HNT will increase.

### Benefits of Staking veHNT

After the Solana migration, stakers can use their staked veHNT to vote on proposals in the HeliumDAO
and help the DAO make collective decisions, influencing the future of the network.

Stakers will additionally be able to delegate veHNT to a subDAO for token rewards. Delegating veHNT
to a subDAO will count towards the DAO Utility Score, the ‘V’ value referenced in HIP 51. The higher
the DAO Utility Score, the higher the proportion of HNT sent the SubDAO treasury every epoch.

The staked return in subDAO tokens is about 4% but will vary based on the amount delegated per
subDAO.

### What Happens to HNT Previously Staked in a Pool?

Check with the vendor managing your staking pool for more detailed information about your staking
pool's decision.

:::warning

The Helium Foundation is neither responsible nor manages the status of Validator staking pools.

:::

If your unstake cooldown period started before the cooldown period was changed from 250,000 blocks
to 125,000 blocks and you have a cooldown date after the proposed date of HIP70 implementation, then
for any stake that has cooled down at least 125,000 blocks, the total stake will be released back to
the account owner.

For any Validator in a cooldown state with any stake (that has cooled down at least 125,000 blocks),
the total stake will be released back to the account owner.

### What Happens if I Unstake Today?

If you unstake today, the expected cooldown period is 125,000 blocks plus up to 30 blocks to the end
of the next epoch or approximately mid-February 2023, which is likely to be later than the
implementation of HIP 70.

Your HNT will convert to veHNT with a staking release date of 6 months from implementing the initial
HIP 70 block.

If you remain staked, your HNT will convert to veHNT with a 6-month staking lock-in period from the
same day of HIP70 implementation.

Your veHNT will receive a 3x Voting Weight multiplier during the 6-month lock-up as a reward for
staking in the network.

### Where Does My HNT Go if I Stake veHNT?

If you stake your HNT for veHNT, your HNT will become veHNT and will remain completely in your
wallet custody. In exchange for your HNT, veHNT will deposit into your wallet.

At the end of the lock-up period, you will receive HNT back to your wallet 1:1 for the HNT you
staked.

### What Is a “Lock Up” Period?

You will incur a lock-up period when you stake your HNT for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 6
and 48 months with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help protect the network from malicious actors and are a security measure to
maintain the stability of the HNT to veHNT swap.

### What is Voting Power?

Voting power is the weight of your vote towards decisions made by the DAO or subDAO. The more veHNT
you have, the more weight your vote has.

You can only increase your voting power by staking more HNT or by extending an existing veHNT stake.

### How to Choose a subDAO to Stake?

[HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
defines that all subDAOs return a maximum of 6% of their earnings to their veHNT delegators and is
designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subDAOs so that no subDAO can buy their way
to a higher DAO Utility score.

Returns can be lower than 6% if the subDAO votes to provide a lower token return in return for other
benefits or similar.

As more HNT deposits in a subDAO's treasury, the DAO Utility Score improves, thus the subDAO's
Hotspot earnings value in HNT.

Stakers with no Hotspot ownership or who are not inclined to one particular subDAO will have to
decide to delegate based on the following:

- The value in HNT of the subDAOs token
- The quantities of HNT and subDAOs tokens in the subDAOs treasury
- The amount of veHNT already staked in the subDAO The current and anticipated Hotspot onboarding
  fees burned in the subDAO
- The anticipated data credits to be burned in the subDAO

A strong trend in the delegation of veHNT to one subDAO to increase the amount of HNT sent to that
subDAOs treasury will increase the amount of value of HNT sent to that treasury per epoch, but, as
more delegators are sharing that 6% return, the share of the 6% will be less.

### How Will Staking Work By Using veHNT?

Anyone can stake ANY amount of HNT for a period of 6 months to 4 years. You choose your unstaking
date at the time of lock-up. The HNT staked is exchanged for veHNT which provides two benefits:

- Voting in the Helium DAO on new subDAO proposals.
- Participating in Governance of the HNT DAO.

Anyone can delegate veHNT to a subDAO for token rewards (DAO Utility Score). Delegating veHNT to a
subDAO allows you to proportionally earn subDAO token rewards.

For example: If I delegate some veHNT to MOBILE subDAO, I proportionally earn MOBILE rewards.

The staked return in subDAO tokens is about 4%, but will vary based on the amount staked per subDAO.

The Helium network encourages your long-term participation in voting and governance. Those that
stake HNT for 6 months, will recieve an exchange of 1:1 HNT to veHNT. Those that stake veHNT for 48
months will recieve an exchange of 1:100 HNT to veHNT. Any time period in between that will be
treated on a linear scale from 1 to 100.

For example: I choose to lock up 10 HNT for 6 months. I recieve 10 veHNT. After 6 months, my veHNT
decays to 0 and I recieve my 10 HNT back into my wallet.

### How Can I Obtain veHNT?

Staking HNT for veHNT will be done on [Realms](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/realms). This is not
available today.

Check out a [DAO beta view](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/dao/MNGO) on Realms today.

### Is There a Staking "Genesis" Period?

For the first 7 days, there will be a 3x bonus for HNT holders becoming new staked veHNT holders.
Only during the 7 day ”genesis” period, after the HIP 70 migration to the Solana blockchain, will
new stakers receive 3x the veHNT they would normally receive for staking.

For example: Staking 10 HNT for 6 months gets 30 veHNT (10x1x3) that decays from 30 to 0 veHNT at
the end of the staking period and 10 HNT is returned to the wallet.

Staking 20 HNT for 24 months gets around 2598 veHNT (20x43.3x3) and these decay to 60 veHNT at 6
months and then remain at 60 veHNT that decays to 0 veHNT at the end of the last month of the
staking period and 20 HNT is returned to the wallet.

### Will I Earn HNT by Staking For veHNT?

No. HNT stakers will not actually earn anymore HNT than they stake.

HNT staked to veHNT will not earn more HNT at the end of the staking period. When you stake 1 HNT to
1 veHNT for your set lock-up period, you will recieve the same amount of HNT back, at the end of the
lock-up period.

However, when you stake HNT into veHNT you are allowed to delegate your veHNT into one or more
subDAOs (such as IOT and/or MOBILE) and the subDAOs allocate up to 6% of their token emissions to
the veHNT owners delegating to that subDAO.

For example: When you delegate your veHNT to the IOT subDAO, you recieve IOT every epoch directly
into your Helium Wallet. This IOT can then be burned at the IOT subDAO treasury for HNT at the floor
level of the IOT/HNT treasury exchange rate and deposited into your Helium Wallet.

### How Do I Stake for veHNT After HIP 51 and 70 Are Implemented?

1. To stake, transfer HNT into your Helium Wallet App (black icon app). Perform this step if you do
   not already have HNT in your wallet.
2. Using the Helium Wallet App, stake HNT into veHNT, and define the period of lock-up. The
   granularity of selection will likely be in blocks.
3. Using the Helium Wallet App, delegate that veHNT into one or more existing subDAOs. You may have
   to complete several transactions depending on how many subDAOs you are delegating to.
4. Your delegated HNT will count towards the subDAOs Utility Score and provide increased HNT
   earnings in the subDAO's treasury per epoch.

This process should be farily simple in the black wallet app. More instructions will be provided as
we get closer to the Solana migration.

All staking and vote escrow delegation operations will be performed within a Solana compatible
Wallet App or the Helium wallet CLI. The black Helium Wallet app will be Solana compatible.

- Staking HNT to veHNT
- Increasing the veHNT staking period for existing veHNT
- Delegating veHNT to a subDAO
- Voting for HNT governance
- Voting for subDAO governance
- Receiving the subDAO token that your veHNT is delegated into

### Do I Have to Delegate My veHNT to a subDAO?

No. You can hold your veHNT as is, or delegate to a subDAO at any time.

Note: Once you delegate veHNT, you cannot un-delegate. You must wait for the lock-up period to end.

### How Granular Is The veHNT Linear Decrease?

The decay in the veHNT quantity in a wallet is granulated per epoch, and the veHNT delegated to a
subDAo decays at the same rate.

A 48 month lock-in period has approximately 42 (48-6 months) x 30 (days) x 48 epochs (30 mins) =
60,480 linear steps between 100 veHNT and 1 veHNT.

After 1 epoch has passed after staking a single 1 HNT for 48 months the quantity of veHNT in the
wallet will decay from 100 veHNT to 99.998347 veHNT. This will decrease by this very small amount
every 30 mins over the 42 months till it reaches 1 veHNT and remains at 1 veHNT for 6 months.

A table showing the approximate HNT to veHNT multiplier for each month of starting a stake or veHNT
a stake has decayed to. Delegating veHNT to a subDAO or veDNT staking decays at the same rates.

### Can I Increase My Staking Period At Any Time?

Yes. You can increase your staking period to the maxium of 48 months at any time. It will be
activated at the next epoch.

### Can I Decrease My Staking Period For Fast Access to My HNT and Take a Penalty?

No. You define your staking period at the time of staking and cannot unstake for any reason.

### Can I Automate Re-staking?

This is being evaluated as the future default option for staking. This will not be available on day
1 on the Solana migration.

### Can I Transfer my veHNT or Any of The veDNTs, like veIOT or veMOBILE, to Someone Else?

No. veHNT and the like is fully non-transferable, and represents your voting power in the network.
It is not a token.

### How Do I Buy veHNT or Any of the veDNTs, Like veIOT or veMOBILE?

You cannot buy veHNT or any of the other veDNTs. It is not a token. veHNT can only be obtained by
staking HNT with a lock-up period. Likewise, you cannot buy veIOT or veMOBILE. veHNT and veDNT have
no price in the larger crypto markets.

### What Is the DAO Utility Score?

The Utility score is described in ([HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336)). Each new
sub-token of HNT, which are MOBILE and IOT (so far), have a utility score which mathematically
describes the proportion shared of HNT tokens distributed to them every epoch from the fixed amount
allocated to all subDAOs. The higher the utility score, the bigger the proportion of HNT emitted to
that subDAO’s treasury per epoch. A sub-token with a utility score of 100 would receive ⅔ of the
emitted HNT in an epoch, assuming the other token had a score of less than 100. But would receive ⅓
if the other token had a score of 200 Delegating veHNT to IOT or MOBILE increases the 'V' value in
the HIP 51 DAO Utility Score calculation. The two other ways the DAO Utility score can be increased
are:

1. The amount of data usage on the subDAO, i.e. the Data Credits burned. This increases the 'D'
   value in the score.
2. The Data Credits used to onboard the number of hotspots for that subDAO. This increases the 'A'
   value in the score.

### Will My subDAO Earnings Remain The Same Over The Time Period Lock-Up?

No, but they are not random like the consesnsus group earnings were for Validators.

They are calculated and paid per epoch. They may increase when:

- More veHNT is delegated to your subDAO (your treasury gets more HNT)
- More hotspot onboarding fees are burned in your subDAO
- More data is transferred and burned in your subDAO

They may decrease when:

- More veHNT is delegated in your subDAO - your share is reduced
- More veHNT is delegated to other subDAOs - other treasuries get more HNT
- Your delegated veHNT decays over time
- More hotspot onboarding fees are burned in other subDAOs
- More data is transferred and burned in other subDAOs
