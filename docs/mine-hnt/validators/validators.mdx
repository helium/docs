# Validators (Testnet)

## Overview

Validators are a new entity on the Helium Blockchain that will perform the work of the consensus group including verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. 

More information about validators and to register interest in staking go [here](https://www.helium.com/stake).

**NOTE: Expect frequent updates during testnet operation which could result in api and faucet service interruptions and may need to be restarted.**

To test validator nodes:
* users need test tokens (TNT) to stake test validator nodes
* the testnet consensus group will be sized dynamically based on the number of active testnet participants
* block production and epochs are accelerated (10 second blocks, 10 minute epochs)
* the cooldown period (number of blocks after unstaking when the validator node doesn't earn rewards, and the stake is returned to the owner's wallet) is shortened to 360 blocks (approx. an hour)

To run a testnet validator node refer to the following:
