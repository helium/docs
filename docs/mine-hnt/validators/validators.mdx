# Validators (Testnet)

Validators are a new entity on the Helium Blockchain that will perform the work of the consensus group including verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain.

## Before you Start...

:::info

Use the ```#validator``` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) server to take part in the real-time Validator development, provide feedback, and report issues.

:::

:::warning 

During the Testnet, expect frequent updates which could result in API and Faucet service interruptions requiring node restarts.

## Deploy a Validator 

Ready to deploy a Validator to the Testnet? The [complete Validator Deployment Guide](/mine-hnt/validators/validator-deployment-guide) will walk you through the entire process.

## Validator Explorer

There is [a new Explorer for Validators](https://explorer.helium.wtf/validators) being developed by Helium and the Community.


## Validator Resources 

To run a Testnet Validator node refer to the following:

## Testnet Overview and Design

As stated above, we are currently running the Testnet. As such, a few things are slightly modified from what will eventually be Mainnet. Specifically:

* Developers need Testnet Network Tokens (TNT) to stake test validator nodes. You can get them [via the Faucet](https://faucet.helium.wtf) but, before you do that, read the [Validator Deployment Guide](/mine-hnt/validators/validator-deployment-guide) so you know how to use them.
* The Testnet Consensus Group will be sized dynamically based on the number of active testnet participants. 
* Testnet block production and epochs are accelerated. They are 10 second blocks and 10 minute epochs (mainnet targets 60 second blocks and 30 minute epochs).
* The cooldown period - defined as the number of blocks after unstaking when the validator node doesn't earn rewards, and the stake is returned to the owner's wallet - is shortened to 360 blocks (or approximately 60 minutes). On mainnet this period will be closer to 200000 blocks.
