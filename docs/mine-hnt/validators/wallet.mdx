# Configure wallet

You’ll need an owner wallet to:
* Stake your testing tokens (TNT)
* Receive validator node consensus group rewards

Note: you can have a single wallet for multiple validator nodes. However multiple wallets for a single validator node is not supported.

For instructions to build the wallet go here: https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs

At any time use ```-h``` or ```--help``` to get more help for a command.

## Wallet commands

### Create a wallet

```./helium-wallet create basic wallet``` 

### View wallet balance and public key
```./bin/helium-wallet balance info``` view public key and TNT balance. You’ll need this public key address to obtain testing tokens needed for staking. 

To obtain TNT tokens visit [Obtain testing token (TNT)](/mine-hnt/validators/validator-tnt).

### Stake tokens
After you have received your TNT you need to stake these tokens. 

As part of the staking process, the validator node address needs to be in the staking transaction and it also needs to sign the transaction. After a wallet stakes a validator node, the wallet becomes that node’s owner, has control over that validator node and receives the validator rewards.

#### To stake tokens perform the following:

* Obtain the validator node address:
    * On the validator, run ```miner peer addr```.  This will produce something like: ```/p2p/112sSfUCQrVNAfFKVZWUSCeLs67wH8o1xz4yj4nKSPJKBT8bUkXi```

    The part following the final slash (in this example ```112sSfUCQrVNAfFKVZWUSCeLs67wH8o1xz4yj4nKSPJKBT8bUkXi```), is the validator node's public address.

* ```./helium-wallet validators stake <public-address> <stake> --commit```

### Unstake tokens
If you unstake tokens the validator node enters a cooldown period. During this cooldown period the validator node will not earn rewards and at the end of the cooldown period (currently 250,000 blocks or approximately 5 months) your initial staking amount will be returned to the wallet. 

#### To unstake tokens from a validator node perform the following:
```./bin/helium-wallet unstake <public-address>```

### Validator transfers 
A wallet can be paired with multiple validator nodes. Validator nodes can be transferred to different wallets. Staking amount can also be transferred to someone else.

#### To transfer a validator's stake to a new validator, or transfer the stake to a validator in another wallet:
```./bin/helium-wallet validators transfer create --new-address <new-public-address> --old-address <old-public-address>```

To transfer the stake to someone else:

```./bin/helium-wallet --format json validators transfer --new-address <new-public-address> --old-address <old-public-address> --new-owner <new-owner-public-address> ```

You'll then need to send the JSON produced to the new owner and have them sign it.
