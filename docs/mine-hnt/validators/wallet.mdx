# Configure wallet

You’ll need an owner wallet to:
* Stake your test tokens (TNT)
* Receive validator node consensus group rewards

Note: you can have a single wallet for multiple validator nodes. However multiple wallets for a single validator node is not supported.

For instructions to build the wallet go [here](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs).

At any time use ```-h``` or ```--help``` to get more help for a command.

## Wallet commands

### Create a wallet

```./bin/helium-wallet create basic wallet --network testnet``` 

### View wallet balance and public key
```./bin/helium-wallet balance info``` view public key and TNT balance. You’ll need this public key address to obtain TNT needed for staking. 

To obtain TNT tokens visit [Obtain testing token (TNT)](/mine-hnt/validators/validator-tnt).

### Stake tokens
After you have received your TNT you need to stake these tokens. 

As part of the staking process the validator node address needs to be in the staking transaction and also needs to sign the transaction. After a wallet stakes a validator node, the wallet becomes that node’s owner, has control over that validator node, and receives the validator rewards.

#### To stake tokens perform the following:

* Obtain the validator node address:
    * On the validator, run ```miner peer addr```.  This will produce something like: ```/p2p/112sSfUCQrVNAfFKVZWUSCeLs67wH8o1xz4yj4nKSPJKBT8bUkXi```

    The part following the final slash, in this example ```112sSfUCQrVNAfFKVZWUSCeLs67wH8o1xz4yj4nKSPJKBT8bUkXi```, is the validator node's public address.

* Stake the TNT:
    * ```./bin/helium-wallet validators stake <public-address> <stake> --commit```

### Unstake tokens
If you unstake tokens the validator node enters a cooldown period. During this cooldown period the validator node will not earn rewards and at the end of the cooldown period (currently 250,000 blocks or approximately 5 months) your initial staking amount will be returned to the wallet. 

#### To unstake tokens from a validator node perform the following:
```./bin/helium-wallet unstake <public-address>```

### Validator transfers 
A wallet can be paired with multiple validator nodes. Validator nodes can be transferred to different wallets. Staking amount can also be transferred to someone else.

#### To transfer a validator's stake to a new validator, or transfer the stake to a validator in another wallet:
```./bin/helium-wallet validators transfer create --new-address <new-public-address> --old-address <old-public-address>```

To transfer the stake to someone else:

```./bin/helium-wallet --format json validators transfer --new-address <new-public-address> --old-address <old-public-address> --new-owner <new-owner-public-address>```

This will produce an output similar to the following:

```
{
  "amount": 0.0,
  "fee": 0,
  "hash": null,
  "new_address": "1YwbuihaJrCxxHMi7Cxu5u57W8LFpfD4J2N6NJLMCYZ2FbQ5hNg",
  "new_owner": "1ZxcEMNnUUwujudHSfYMS9YUoQPQHor6wceRLxdpL8txWCJ7UKZ",
  "nonce": 2,
  "old_address": "1YwbuihaJrCxxHMi7Cxu5u57W8LFpfD4J2N6NJLMCYZ2FbQ5hNg",
  "old_owner": "1ZxcEMNnUUwujudHSfYMS9YUoQPQHor6wceRLxdpL8txWCJ7UKZ",
  "txn": "8gHQAQohEG6PJ7AZkUSGBqEO89CmdQAu8Y6SepBx11wgw2IY7WWGEiEQbo8nsBmRRIYGoQ7z0KZ1AC7xjpJ6kHHXXCDDYhjtZYYaIRD0idqz8SRyoUMBZhygY/fgpX9juEX+46Pya8ZyMMxa0yIhEdxxIOJxUVrnbQo2f/htY/kWQy3bWq5o0hVz4DQMZdPzMkBmtCjmV++wGbLp5oSVoUQJMYCE2u4AuhBhTZFWa2vhew6XBTYY4UIdqGiK0Fb9AD5qed7OW18smUP66Yfg+swISAI="
}
```

You'll then need to send the JSON produced to the new owner and have them sign it by calling:

```./bin/helium-wallet validators transfer accept --commit <txn>```

Where ```<txn>``` is replaced by the unquoted version of the ```txn``` field in the JSON above.
