## Helium Entity API

Helium provides a basic API for accessing high-level data about entities on the network.

- [Entity API Documentation](/network-data/entity-api)

## Third-Party API Providers

Helium's open on-chain data and Oracles enable third-party API providers to offer rich,
production-grade access to network data. These providers power robust applications and services in
the Helium ecosystem.

### Relay

Relay API provides an easy access to all Helium Oracle, on-chain, and historical data via simple
REST endpoints. The API is public and free to use with the Community plan, sponsored by Helium
Foundation. Community can get instant access to data like Hotspot earnings, Hotspot information,
mobile data offload, and much more.

Relay API also provides paid plans to help support users who are looking to access data at scale.
Paid plans offer higher monthly API call limits, premium features, and allow to fetch all historical
data, including from Helium L1.
