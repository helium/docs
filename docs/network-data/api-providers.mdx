## Helium Entity API

Helium provides a basic API for accessing high-level data about entities on the network.

- [Entity API Documentation](/network-data/entity-api)

## Third-Party API Providers

Helium's open on-chain data and Oracles enable third-party API providers to offer rich,
production-grade access to network data. These providers power robust applications and services in
the Helium ecosystem.

### HeliumGeek

HeliumGeek delivers a production-grade Helium API that blends on-chain and off-chain intelligence
into a single, reliable service. The same endpoints that drive our mobile apps and fleet management
platform power rewards tracking, Hotspot health monitoring, performance tracking, and custom vector
map tiles with confidence, giving us hands-on insight into what Helium operators really need.

By focusing exclusively on Helium, we absorb every protocol change and publish new data the moment
it becomes available. Customers and clients lean on us for live dashboards and community explorers
because we operate the API around the clock, bolster it with proactive monitoring, and back it with
a track record of accuracy and stability that has supported the ecosystem since 2021.

Flexible paid plans align with deployments ranging from boutique operations to nationwide fleets,
ensuring the infrastructure scales without sacrificing responsiveness or support. Our independent
funding model keeps the platform sustainable, while we still extend complimentary access to research
collaborations and other strategic partners that benefit the broader Helium community.
