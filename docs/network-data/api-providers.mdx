## Helium Entity API

Helium provides a basic API for accessing high-level data about entities on the network. This API is
provided without any guarantees of uptime or support, and is intended for light use cases.

## Third-Party API Providers

Helium provides extensive network data through Oracles, but does not offer an extensive first-party
API for accessing this data. Instead, several third-party API providers have built services on top
of Helium's open data infrastructure. These providers power robust applications and services in the
Helium ecosystem.
