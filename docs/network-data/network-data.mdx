The Helium Network operates a hybrid architecture, combining on-chain data stored on the Solana
blockchain with data stored in network Oracles.

On-chain data includes information about Hotspots, wallet and account state, tokens, and other
attributes that pertain to the Helium Network.

Oracles store additional network data that is not practical to store on-chain, such as Hotspot
earnings, witness data, and other time-series information.

Review the relevant documents for a deeper dive into each data source:

- [Oracles](/network-data/oracle-data)

In addition to the raw data sources, Helium and third-party providers offer APIs that provide
convenient access to network data:

- [Helium API Providers](/network-data/api-providers)

Data from Helium's legacy blockchain (Helium L1) is also available for historical reference:
