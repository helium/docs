All actors in the network that receive tokens are considered "Rewardable Entities."

A rewardable entity on the Helium Network is represented on Solana as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token).

NFTs are ideal for this job as they represent ownership in a way that is easily transferable and
recognized by all major wallets.

## Fetching Rewardable Entities

All rewardable entities are created by the `helium-entity-manager` program. Further, they exist
under a collection that is managed by the Maker of that entity. The easiest way to fetch all Helium
entities for a given wallet is to filter by the `helium-entity-manager-creator`

We can get this address by running

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { daoKey } from "@helium/helium-sub-daos-sdk";
import { entityCreatorKey } from "@helium/helium-entity-manager-sdk";

const hntMint = new PublicKey('...hnt mint...')
const dao = daoKey(hntMint)[[0]]
const creator = entityCreatorKey(dao)[0]
```

This should output: `Fv5hf1Fg58htfC7YEXKNEfkpuogUUQDDTLgjGWxxv48H`

Now, we can use the Metaplex Digital Asset API to get rewardable entities my wallet
(`BcJzP2hEYgzjUwpHEtS6RhuqGfEJVx8Rq3MejujAAWrR`) owns:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://rpc-devnet.aws.metaplex.com/ \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "search_assets",
      "id": "get-assets-op-1",
      "params": {
        "ownerAddress": "BcJzP2hEYgzjUwpHEtS6RhuqGfEJVx8Rq3MejujAAWrR",
        "page": 0,
        "creatorAddress": "Fv5hf1Fg58htfC7YEXKNEfkpuogUUQDDTLgjGWxxv48H",
        "creatorVerified": true,
        "sortBy": {"sortBy": "created", "sortDirection": "asc"}
      }
    }'
```

### Hotspots and ECC Compact Keys

Hotspots on the Helium Network currently are uniquely identified by their ECC Compact Public Keys.

At onboarding time, Hotspots can sign an onboard transaction proving physical ownership of the
device.

As such, the Helium Solana implementation enforces that all NFTs are unique by ECC Compact keys.

If you have an asset id of an NFT on Solana, you can get the ECC Compact Key by fetching the digital
asset and pulling out the last value from the content.json_uri.

For example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { getAsset } from "@helium/spl-utils";

const asset = await getAsset(rpcUrl, new PublicKey("...asset id..."));

const eccCompactKey = asset.content.json_uri.split("/").slice(-1)[0];
```

If you have only an ECC Compact key and would like to find the NFT, you can use the `KeyToAssetV0`
struct that is stored on-chain:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { daoKey } from "@helium/helium-sub-daos-sdk"
import { keyToAssetKey, init } from "@helium/helium-entity-manager-sdk"

// Declare constants
const hntMint = new PublicKey("...hnt mint...")
const dao = daoKey(hntMint)[0]
const eccKey = "...ecc compact key..."

// Init program
const program = await init(provider);

// Get the asset id from the KeyToAssetV0 account on-chain
const keyToAssetPkey = keyToAssetKey(dao, eccKey)[0]
const keyToAssetAcc = await program.account.keyToAssetV0.fetch(keyToAssetPkey);
const assetId = keyToAssetAcc.asset;

// Now get the asset from the metaplex asset api
const asset = await getAsset(rpcUrl, assetId)
```

## Onboarding Rewardable Entities

The onboarding flow for an entity is generally that a customer purchases the hardware from a Maker,
and then self-onboards to the network. Because all hardware is created by approved Makers, the
onboard transaction must be approved by the Maker. This uses a similar flow to the legacy
onboarding-server of the Helium blockchain.

Makers are approved for specific subnetworks. A maker that creates IoT Hotspots cannot necessarily
onboard Mobile Hotspots. Each network subnetwork must approve makers to issue rewardable entities.

The following test shows the full flow of onboarding a Hotspot using the onboarding server.

The [React Native Helium](https://github.com/helium/react-native-helium) SDK should greatly simplify
this process.

## Claiming Rewards on Rewardable Entities

A system of oracles keeps track of the rewards owed to each Rewardable Entity. For example, in the
IoT network there are oracles that keep track of the HNT tokens earned by each Hotspot for PoC.

These oracles are responsible ONLY for tracking the total lifetime rewards associated with a
Hotspot. This frees the oracles from any kind of dependence on the blockchain. They don't care about
the issuance or movement of tokens.

The `lazy-distributor` program keeps track of, for each Hotspot, how much of the total lifetime
rewards have been claimed. Claiming rewards, then, consists of two steps:

1. Ask oracles to update the on-chain state to reflect the latest lifetime rewards for this Hotspot.
2. Issue the difference between the total lifetime rewards and total claimed rewards to the Hotspot
   owner.

In practice, we have made it so that this can all happen in a singular transaction for PoC rewards.
Staking rewards will happen in transactions combining up to 4 days of rewards.

### Finding Current Rewards

Oracles work off of a restful API that involves

1. Grabbing lifetime rewards for all oracles.
2. Constructing a transaction to set the rewards and passing the transaction to each oracle to
   partially sign.
3. Submitting the fully signed transaction to Solana.

The SDK simplifies this process into two functions, `getCurrentRewards` and `formTransaction`.

If you have interest in using the REST api, you can see the relatively simple client code
[here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/blob/master/packages/distributor-oracle/src/client.ts)

To fetch rewards across all oracles for a given asset id:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { init, lazyDistributorKey } from "@helium/lazy-distributor-sdk";
import { getCurrentRewards } from "@helium/distributor-oracle";
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";

anchor.setProvider(anchor.AnchorProvider.local("...rpc url..."));
const provider = anchor.getProvider() as anchor.AnchorProvider;
const program = await init(provider)

const iotMint = new PublicKey("...iot mint...")
const assetId = new PublicKey("...asset id...")
const lazyDistributorPkey = lazyDistributorKey(iotMint)[0];
const rewards = await getCurrentRewards(program, lazyDistributorPkey, assetId);

rewards.map(reward => {
  console.log(`Oracle ${reward.oracleKey} stating lifetime rewards of ${reward.currentRewards}`);
})
```

### Claiming Rewards

:::info

The claim example in this section requires a connection to an RPC node (provider) that understands
compressed NFTs. This is an advanced feature that is not yet supported by Solana's public RPC
servers. **This example will not work unless you use an appropriate RPC provider such as
[Helius](https://www.helius.xyz/).**

:::

You can then get a transaction to submit to the Solana blockchain using those rewards:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js

import { formTransaction } from "@helium/distributor-oracle";
import { sendAndConfirmWithRetry } from "@helium/spl-utils";

const tx = await formTransaction({
  program,
  provider,
  rewards, // from above
  hotspot: assetId,
  lazyDistributor: lazyDistributorPkey,
})

const signed = await provider.wallet.signTransaction(tx);

await sendAndConfirmWithRetry(
  provider.connection,
  Buffer.from(signed.serialize()),
  { skipPreflight: true },
  'confirmed',
);
```
