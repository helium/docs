The [Mappers Coverage map](https://mappers.helium.com) is a crowd-sourced effort to build a
true-signal coverage map of the Helium network across the globe. By mapping real-world coverage,
network users can understand where sensor deployments are likely to have success connecting to
Helium.

> Coverage mapping should only be done from ground level, or slightly above it. We would like the
> map to indicate the expected coverage a standard sensor device would experience. If you want to
> fly a GPS tracker on a balloon or aircraft, please do not contribute this data to the coverage
> map.

[#mappers](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/730801390431240228) channel on the
[Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium).

## Mapping Projects

### Helium Mappers

Helium Mappers lets you see the areas that have been explored by participants in the coverage
mapping project. The map also shows the Helium hotspots that have provided coverage to these areas.
Helium Mappers uses the H3 hexagon tiles to aggregate survey results and provided statistics. View
Mappers data at [mappers.helium.com](https://mappers.helium.com/).

### Helium Cargo

Cargo is an evaluation tool for LoRaWAN GPS tracking devices. It shows the current location of these
devices, along with the coverage of the network as an H3 hex grid. While Helium Mappers shows an
aggregate view of the network coverage, Cargo can display specific mapper devices by name, and their
most-recent position reports.

View GPS trackers on Cargo at [cargo.helium.com](https://cargo.helium.com/).

### CoverageMap.net

Coverage Map is a third party tool that draws heatmaps for LoRaWAN networks. This tool has the
ability to show raw survey results for devices and hotspots. It aggregates coverage measurements
into a heatmap, radar plots and alpha shapes. View Helium's heatmap at
[CoverageMap.net](https://coveragemap.net/).

## Project Roadmap

Take a look at the big picture in the [Mappers Roadmap](/iot/coverage-mapping/roadmap). The roadmap
is a great way to understand the full scope of the project and find an area to make your own
contributions to the project.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Mappers work?

Participants use low cost LoRaWAN devices to survey the real-world network created by Helium. Many
contributors bring their mapper with them when they walk, hike, bike, drive or even boat! They’re
small and fit well in a pocket or on a car dash. Some have set up their mappers so they’re
contributing to the coverage map every time they take a drive.

In order to place a mark on the map, the mapper device sends out a signal with a GPS location
encoded. If a Helium Hotspot ‘hears’ that signal, data is passed through the internet and recorded
in the Mappers database. The Mappers database uses the GPS information from the Mapper to ‘light up’
the hex on the map.

### Why should I contribute to Mappers?

There are a variety of ways that Mapping is valuable to both hotspot owners and network users. For
hotspot owners, the collected data helps to visualize the coverage provided by all Helium hotspots -
identifying areas where coverage is lacking or even where hotspot placements could be made that
would participate in Proof of Coverage with other hotspots. A marked hex on the map indicates that
uplink signals from registered Helium LoRaWAN sensors have been proven to be “heard” by the Helium
network somewhere within that hex shaped area.

For network users, the map proves the real-world coverage that hotspots provide. This is like
looking at the Verizon or T-Mobile map when evaluating phone plans, but for business users. This
real world evidence at the scale and resolution offered by our map gives prospective network users
the information they need to make decisions about their deployments. As an example, this map is what
someone like Lime scooters would look to before they sign a contract.

In short, a robust map means high priced customers, which means adoption, which means the network
grows and the token value increases.

### Do I earn HNT for contributing?

No, coverage mapping is entirely voluntary. In order to participate in mapping, you will need to
spend Data Credits to pay for the data transfer that your mapper uses. To get you started, new
Helium Console accounts are funded with 250 DC. Beyond that, HNT can be converted to DC to fund
device data transfer or DC can be purchased directly through Console.

Mapping does not make a hotspot earn more HNT through Proof of Coverage. The real value is to prove
the network, drive adoption, and increase the purchase of data credits by commercial users.

If the hotspots that you are mapping are your own, those data credits are paid back to your hotspots
in the form of HNT. Hotspots earn HNT for data packets they transfer, for mapping or otherwise.

### How can I use Mappers for my own hotspot deployments?

- Find new locations for hotspots.
- Get real-world information about how far your hotspot reaches.
- Learn RF data analytics in an interactive way.

### How can I use Mappers for my own sensor deployments?

Take a mapping device to the area where you want to deploy sensors and watch to see if it is picked
up by a hotspot in the hex where you want to deploy a sensor. If it’s picked up by only one hotspot,
decide if you want to deploy an additional hotspot in that area for sensor connection redundancy.
Look at existing mapped areas for confirmation that your sensors can be deployed in that area and
how many hotspot can pick them up. It only takes one hotspot to receive and transmit data through
the internet, but the redundancy offered by the Helium Network helps to ensure that your data is
received.

## Get Started with Mapping

There are a wide variety of ways to get involved depending on your level of comfort with
arduino-type devices. A few common devices are listed below, but in no way is this list exhaustive.

### Fully Preconfigured

Fully managed mapping devices are ready to use as soon as they arrive. These are pre-configured and
enrolled by the seller, and not your own Helium Console. The Data Credits are provided by the
seller, and the devices have pre-selected back-end Integrations that are not user-configurable.
Generally, these devices are the most easy and accessible, requiring just power to start mapping.

### Plug & Play

Console-ready device that you onboard to spend your own Data Credits. The
[Mappers Quickstart](/iot/coverage-mapping/quickstart) guide focuses on the the Dragino LGT-92, but
the steps are effectively the same for any mapping device.

up a mapper from your own dev board is a great way to learn about LoRaWAN devices on the Helium
Network.

### Configuration Basics

At its core, contributing to Helium Mappers is just a matter of delivering a specific payload
through the console. Learn more about the [Mappers API](/iot/coverage-mapping/api).

If your mapping device is delivering messages to Helium Mappers, you can also enable the
integrations for [Cargo](/network-iot/console/integrations/cargo/) and
[CoverageMap.net](https://docs.ttnmapper.org/integration/helium.html) to contribute to these two
projects using the same Decoded payload.

A flow that sends data to all three projects would look similar to this:

## Understanding the Mappers Visualization

From within the [Mappers tool](http://mappers.helium.com), clicking on a green hexagon will allow
you to get more information about the coverage available in that region.

- H3 Index
  - The funny looking number like `89283082853ffff` is the unique h3 index of the hexagon on the
    map. In other words, it's the hex’s name. H3 is a system of managing global datasets, and is
    pervasive throughout different Helium protocols.
- RSSI
  - “Received Signal Strength Indicator” is a measure of the power present in a received radio
    signal. This number is computed by the hotspot when it hears the signal from a mapper. The
    higher the signal (less negative), the ‘stronger’ it is considered.
- SNR
  - “Signal to Noise” measures the ratio of received power to background power in the received
    signal. Like the RSSI, it is also computed by the hotspot when it hears signal from the mapper.
    A higher ratio represents a clear signal whereas a negative number in this field represents a
    noisy signal.
- Redundancy
  - The total count of hotspots that heard a mapper from within this hex. This metric is helpful in
    understanding the resilience of the network in a given area.
- Distance
  - This is the approximate distance of the mapper from the hotspot that heard it.
