# Adeunis Mapper

## Mapping Tips

- Only operate at an above ground level of 1-2 meters, otherwise your data will not be
  representative of most real world devices.
- The device is configured with an uplink interval of five seconds, sufficient for mapping on foot
  or in a moving vehicle.

## Device Instructions

### Charging

The device is rechargeable via a micro USB connector located on the bottom. It will charge
automatically in the ON or OFF state. The device can be used while charging. Any charger supplying
5V and at least 500mA is sufficient.

If the battery is completely empty, it will be necessary to recharge the device for 6 hours in order
for it to be fully charged.

### Operating Procedure

Follow all the steps provided below for step-by-step instructions on how to properly operate the
field test device.

:::important

You must power on the device in a location with coverage in order for the device to first join the
network. If the device is not able to join, it will never begin sending uplinks.

:::

First, power the device On by flipping the switch on the bottom of the device into the ON position.

After you are presented with the start screen, you will see the join screen.

Start Screen

Join Screen

Press _Push Button 2,_ shown below, once to navigate to the GPS screen, also shown below. If the
backlight is off, you will have to press the button twice, once to turn the backlight back on and
another time to navigate to the next screen.

Push Button 2

GPS Screen

Once you have navigated to the GPS screen you'll next be monitoring this screen to validate that the
device has a sufficient GPS fix (enough satellites are visible to accurately calculate its position
and time). Make sure the device is located in a place where a good amount of the sky is visible.
Once your device obtains a fix (this may take a few minutes), you will see a latitude and longitude
show as well as how many satellites are visible. It's best if six or more satellites are visible.
You can now navigate to the Packet Count screen by again pressing the same _Push Button 2_, once if
the display backlight is on, and twice if it is off.

:::important

Ignore the PER % number as shown in the packet count screen below. This value is not meaningful for
the current configuration. Only pay attention to the UL\(Uplink\) Count.

Packet Count Screen

Once you see a positive number in the UL Count field, you have successfully joined the network and
are now transmitting packets with location data. At this point you are ready to begin mapping new
area. Read about how you can view your location live with Helium Cargo below! When you are finished,
simply switch the power switch to OFF.

## Viewing on Cargo

When your device is transmitting packets with a valid GPS fix your device will be visible on
[cargo.helium.com](https://cargo.helium.com/). The device names are in the format of _Mapper \#_,
with the number being that which is displayed on the front of your device with a label as shown
below. The Avg Speed, Elevation, and Voltage will always show zero, as these values were not
included.

When you click on your device on the left, you will see a details window pop up in the right top of
the window. Here you can click on the _Sequence No_ box shown below to get a time series view of
each packet that was received in sequence as well as the Hotspot that received it. The sequence
number should match the _UL Count_ on the _Packet Count_ screen shown on the device, although it
will likely be a few seconds delayed. The sequence number will start from zero after each power
cycle of the device.

You can also click on the _RSSI_ box shown below to view a time series view again, but with the
signal strength and Hotspot that received each packet.
