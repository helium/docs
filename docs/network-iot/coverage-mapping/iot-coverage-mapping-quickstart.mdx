## Mapping Devices

There are a wide variety of ways to get involved depending on your level of comfort with
arduino-type devices. A few common devices are listed below, but in no way is this list exhaustive.

### Fully Preconfigured

Fully managed mapping devices are ready to use as soon as they arrive. These are pre-configured and
enrolled by the seller, and not your own Helium Console. The Data Credits are provided by the
seller, and the devices have pre-selected back-end Integrations that are not user-configurable.
Generally, these devices are the most easy and accessible, requiring just power to start mapping.

### Plug & Play

Console-ready device that you onboard to spend your own Data Credits. The
[Mappers Quickstart](/iot/coverage-mapping/quickstart) guide focuses on the the Dragino LGT-92, but
the steps are effectively the same for any mapping device.

### DIY Mappers

Flash your own code, add the device to your Helium Console, and spend your own Data Credits. Setting
up a mapper from your own dev board is a great way to learn about LoRaWAN devices on the Helium
Network.

## Configuration Basics

At its core, contributing to Helium Mappers is just a matter of delivering a specific payload
through the console. Learn more about the [Mappers API](/iot/coverage-mapping/api).

If your mapping device is delivering messages to Helium Mappers, you can also enable the
integrations for [Cargo](/console/integrations/cargo) and
[CoverageMap.net](https://docs.ttnmapper.org/integration/helium.html) to contribute to these two
projects using the same Decoded payload.

A flow that sends data to all three projects would look similar to this:

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('img/flow-mappers-cargo-coverage.png')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 350, minWidth: 0, flex: '1 1 auto' }}
  />
</figure>

---

This guide will show you step by step how to contribute data to the Mappers project with an
off-the-shelf tracker. This guide will use the
[Dragino LGT92](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/142-lgt-92.html), but any LoRaWAN
compatible tracker will work.

### Steps

1. Add device to Console.
2. Create new HTTP integration with Mappers API ingest endpoint.
3. Create Function Decoder to decode device payload.
4. Create a Flow and verify data is being sent successfully.

### 1. Add Device to Console

To start, you'll need to add your device to Console. You should have been provided with a DevEUI,
AppEUI, and AppKey from the seller of the device. Follow our [quickstart](/console/quickstart) for
instructions on how to add a new device to Console.

### 2. Create HTTP Integration

To create a new HTTP integration in Console, navigate to the Integrations page using the left
navigation and then select the HTTP integration.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-select-http.png')} />

Next we'll fill in the details, see instructions and image below.

1. Enter the Mappers API Ingest Endpoint URL (Required)
   `https://mappers.helium.com/api/v1/ingest/uplink`
2. Enter the name for this Integration: _Mappers Integration_
3. Finally, click _Add Integration_ to complete.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-http-integration.png',
  )}
/>

### 3. Create Function Decoder

Next, we'll be creating a Function decoder to decode the payload from the device and properly format
it for the API endpoint. The decoder is specific to the encoding scheme used to encode the data
before the device transmits it. For off-the-shelf devices this is usually manufacturer specific. For
development devices,
[CayenneLPP](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload) is
often used. For this guide we'll be using a decoder specifically made for this tracking device. We
have a repository with decoders for various devices
[here](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders).

To start, navigate to the Functions page using the left navigation and then click _Add Function_.

1. Enter a name for the decoder (below we've used _Dragino LGT92 Decoder_), select the type of
   Function, _Decoder_ in this case, and finally select _Custom Script_ from the drop down.
2. Copy and paste the complete decoder function provided by the manufacturer or found
   [here](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders/blob/master/Dragino/LGT92/decoder-v1.6.4.js).

   ```javascript
   function Decoder(bytes, port) {
     // Decode an uplink message from a buffer
     // (array) of bytes to an object of fields.
     var latitude //gps latitude,units: °
     latitude = ((bytes[0] << 24) | (bytes[1] << 16) | (bytes[2] << 8) | bytes[3]) / 1000000 //gps latitude,units: °
     var longitude
     longitude = ((bytes[4] << 24) | (bytes[5] << 16) | (bytes[6] << 8) | bytes[7]) / 1000000 //gps longitude,units: °
     var alarm = bytes[8] & 0x40 ? 'TRUE' : 'FALSE' //Alarm status
     var batV = (((bytes[8] & 0x3f) << 8) | bytes[9]) / 1000 //Battery,units:V
     if ((bytes[10] & 0xc0) == 0x40) {
       var motion_mode = 'Move'
     } else if ((bytes[10] & 0xc0) == 0x80) {
       motion_mode = 'Collide'
     } else if ((bytes[10] & 0xc0) == 0xc0) {
       motion_mode = 'User'
     } else {
       motion_mode = 'Disable'
     } //mode of motion

     var led_updown = bytes[10] & 0x20 ? 'ON' : 'OFF' //LED status for position,uplink and downlink
     var Firmware = 160 + (bytes[10] & 0x1f) // Firmware version; 5 bits
     var roll = (((bytes[11] << 24) >> 16) | bytes[12]) / 100 //roll,units: °
     var pitch = (((bytes[13] << 24) >> 16) | bytes[14]) / 100 //pitch,units: °
     var hdop = 0
     if (bytes[15] > 0) {
       hdop = bytes[15] / 100 //hdop,units: Â°
     } else {
       hdop = bytes[15]
     }
     var altitude = (((bytes[16] << 24) >> 16) | bytes[17]) / 100 //Altitude,units: °
     return {
       latitude: latitude, // Note that must be lower-case
       longitude: longitude,
       altitude: altitude,
       accuracy: 3,
       Roll: roll,
       Pitch: pitch,
       BatV: batV,
       ALARM_status: alarm,
       MD: motion_mode,
       LON: led_updown,
       FW: Firmware,
       HDOP: hdop,
     }
   }
   ```

   Next we need to verify that all required fields are present in the function. Find more details on
   the API specification [here](/iot/coverage-mapping/api). The required fields are case-sensitive.
   If you got your decoder from the manufacturer and one or more required fields are missing - add
   them with hard-coded values like accuracy in the above example.

3. Finally, save your function.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-decoder.png')} />

### 4. Create a Flow

Next we will create a [_Flow_](/console/flows/orientation). Navigate to the Flows page and click
the + sign next to Nodes.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-flow-nodes.png')}
/>

Drag and drop your device, function and integration on the workspace. Link them by drawing lines
with your mouse between the connection points. Link device -> decoder -> integration.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-flow-basic.png')}
/>

You are now ready to power on your device and verify that data is being sent correctly to the Mapper
API. To do this just expand an uplink event in the event log and verify that you are getting a
_"Success"_ message for the integration as shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-device-event.png')} />

That's all! You can now expect to see your data show up on
[mappers.helium.com](https://mappers.helium.com) in a few minutes. If you want to see where your
mapper is on the map, you could use [Cargo](https://cargo.helium.com). You will have to add one more
[integration](/console/integrations/cargo#add-a-cargo-integration) and link it to the decoder in
your flow.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-flow-with-cargo.png')}
/>
