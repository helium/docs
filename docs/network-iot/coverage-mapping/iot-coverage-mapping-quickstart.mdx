## Mapping Devices

There are a wide variety of ways to get involved depending on your level of comfort with
arduino-type devices. A few common devices are listed below, but in no way is this list exhaustive.

### Fully Preconfigured

Fully managed mapping devices are ready-to-use as soon as they arrive. These are pre-configured and
enrolled by the seller, and not your own Helium Console. The Data Credits are provided by the
seller, and the devices have pre-selected back-end Integrations that are not user-configurable.
Generally, these devices are the most easy and accessible, requiring just power to start mapping.

### DIY Mappers

Flash your own code, add the device to your Helium Console, and spend your own Data Credits. Setting
up a mapper from your own dev board is a great way to learn about LoRaWAN devices on the Helium
Network.
