:::warning Removing A Hotspot from the Denylist with Crowdspot

If a Hotspot has been added to the Denylist in error, the **only** method to have it removed is to
file a Removal Request using [Crowdspot](https://crowdspot.io/).

**Instructions for submitting a removal request can be found on the
[Denylist Removal Request documentation page.](/iot/denylist-removals)**

:::

[Crowdspot](https://crowdspot.io/) is an unmonitored, self-service tool built by Nova Labs for the
Helium Community. This tool allows anyone to explore Helium Network Hotspot data to understand
atypical Hotspot behavior and identify anomalies.

Similar to Voting, submitting Denylist additions, removal requests, or casting a vote on the status
of a Hotspot requires a Crowdspot account associated with a unique Helium Wallet address.

If you do not have the [Helium Wallet app](/helium-wallet-app), you'll need to download the Helium
Wallet app and create a new Wallet or import an existing Wallet before proceeding.

:::note Crowdspot Connections are Free

There are 0 fees to connect a Helium Wallet address to Crowdspot.

## How to Submit to the Denylist

To submit Hotspots for Denylist consideration, start by logging in with your Helium Wallet and
clicking on the `Submit Denylist Request` button on the Crowdspot.io landing page.

### Log In with the Helium Wallet App

To associate a Helium Wallet address, click the `Login` menu bar item on the Crowdspot homepage and
scan the QR code with your phone.

<div className="img-center">
  <img className="appscreenbanner" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/login-popover.png')} />
</div>

Once you have scanned the QR Code, the Helium Wallet app will open and prompt you to authenticate
Crowdspot.

1. **Confirm Connection Start**: Confirm that you _do_ want to connect a Helium Wallet to Crowdspot.
2. **Choose Wallet**: Choose the account you would like to use with Crowdspot, and tap Continue.
3. **Authenticate**: Send a transaction to the Helium blockchain to complete login.

address. The Profile badge will match in the Helium Wallet app and on Crowdspot. If you are already
logged in, you will see a Profile Badge and a portion of the connected Wallet

Otherwise, if no account is logged in, no Profile Badge is visible, and the `Login` menu bar item is
shown.

:::note Login Status Indication

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>

#### How to Log Out

You can log out of Crowdspot by clicking your profile badge in the upper right corner and selecting
`Log Me Out` from the pop-up menu.

<div className="img-center">
  <img className="appscreenbanner" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/logout-popover.png')} />
</div>

### Submit an Addition

Once you have logged in, click the `Submit Denylist Request` button to begin your submission.

<div className="img-center">
  <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/report-addition.png')} />
</div>

#### Submission Type

On the Submission form, select the `Addition` radio button under `Submission Type.`

#### Enter Hotspot Address

Copy and paste the `b58` address of the Hotspot into the `Enter Hotspot b58 Address` field. The
`b58` address for a Hotspot is the 52-character address of the Hotspot, **NOT THE ANIMAL NAME**. The
`b58` address for a given Hotspot is the end of the URL for the Hotspot on the Helium Explorer or
the value next to `Address` on the Hotspot's page on Crowdspot.

Multiple Hotspots can be added as part of a single Denylist submission by clicking the `+` button
and inputting more Hotspot `b58` addresses.

#### Reporting Clusters

Some abnormal Hotspots are part of a "Cluster", a group of Hotspots that only witness each other.
Clusters are often asserted in a roughly circular formation and may be nestled among legitimate
Hotspots.

When reporting a Cluster of Hotspots, include all `b58` addresses **and** toggle on the
`Is this a cluster of Hotspots` checkbox. This information assists in evaluating the legitimacy of
the Hotspots in the request.

#### Written Reasoning

Submitting a written description to support the Denylist submission provides valuable insight for
evaluation. A minimum of 150 characters is required.

#### Create the Submission

Once you have added all the required and optional information, click the `Create Submission` button.

:::note Submission Status

You can view the status of your submission on the
[Submissions page](https://www.crowdspot.io/submissions/), linked in the Crowdspot menu bar.

### Submitting Hotspots as a Batch

Investigation of abnormal Hotspots can be a lot of work, and many workflows exist, especially for
the submission of large Clusters. To make the process easier for extensive submissions, Hotspot
`b58` addresses can be added in a batch (of up to 100 addresses) rather than one at a time.

<div className="img-center">
  <img className="homeicon" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/report-removal-batch.png')} />
</div>

#### Entering a Batch of Hotspot Addresses

To submit multiple Hotspots, Click the `Submit a Batch` link, and the individual address entry field
will be replaced with a text box.

:::caution Formatting is essential!

Hotspot addresses must be separated by commas; no more than 100 addresses can be included in a
single submission.

:::

#### Good Example

> comma separated, no new lines, 100 or fewer addresses

```bash
112Y9MOI0cSuhXXmtdjbwbggmiUTXtpGvz26djJscfJKRfoj2sUN,112YoUnnjdbi2qW51UNdcfIfzLvfzLwmWkvE7ZO1LJoz8j5XyfGu,112snBh48MrKFwkzT29ciqPDjFkpq0FtQI6uCv4EpOK6QfW9w45N,112ugTSdVRHWvO85WrAuV5JvcytQYRnkgdxtxgXKNOGMi1XYXQR7,112ZTwJcUBGC65J3XjQGKWmNkcGspVFOkDyZJVCRs5vIQrpPyT8O,112VDtGIy9COHkZFdsBQyAXM9aOfbQ2oIKSOOBSVbpwV38dxnDN5,113oCV3rIwxwwG2umgc0vBbSqRm856HrUFRdgWAJERXkA9M5aVmu,113Wcs25X8JYDVzWKgAgf1nzkUnS2i9XLrYV4bbo9RL4Xv2Q4Yay,113nRmEovrRvQF6UNFrSv79Ys9Thuw6ajAJrN7wpmen9KbqZO7nU,114xSLeZSB6DaWkirHGZsxQ0kfs2DwZ8zIFQQWRnQshshcZ0zXl8

## Voting

A connected Helium Wallet can vote on the legitimacy or abnormality of a given Hotspot. This
community feedback assists in the evaluation process and is an essential factor in the evaluation
process.

To submit a vote, navigate to a Hotspot page on Crowdspot and below the map, select the option to
Vote that the Hotspot is `Legitimate`, or that the Hotspot is `Abnormal` given the information
provided.

## Hotspot Evaluation Metrics

Crowdspot provides insight to several metrics for a given Hotspot that can be used to assist the
Community in identifying abnormal Hotpots and validating legitimate Hotspots.

:::note Current Denylist Status

If a Hotspot is currently on the Denylist, they will have a special badge on their page. This badge
is -not- present for Hotspots -not- currently on the Denylist.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6 img-center" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <img className="crowdspot-vote-button" src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/denylist-badge.png')} />
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <p>
        This example badge includes <b>"+ 54 other appearances"</b>, which indicates that this
        particular Hotspot appears on the latest Denylist and in <b>54</b> previous updates of the
        Denylist.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

:::

### Location Confidence

Using witness receipt data, 1,000 programmatic estimates of the asserted location are made to derive
a predicted location of a Hotspot.

The Location Confidence Score metric reflects what percentage of estimations are within range of the
Hotspots asserted location.

When under 20% of estimations are further than 2.3 km from the asserted location, we would describe
that Hotspot as abnormal.

### Witness Maker Diversity

The Witness Maker Diversity metric gives the percentage of Hotspots witnessed by the original
Hotspot that are produced by different Makers.

When under 15% of the Hotspots being witnessed are made by different Makers, then we would describe
that Hotspot as abnormal.

### Witness SNR versus RSSI Plot

This graph compares a Hotspot's Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) against its Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI). In general, small RSSI values correlate to a low SNR and vice versa.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Legitimate Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="crowdspot-chart img-center"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/snr-rssi-legit-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        Witnesses will likely show a more natural, positive correlation over a broad range of RSSI
        and SNR values.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Abnormal Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="crowdspot-chart img-center"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/snr-rssi-sus-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        Witnesses tend to appear 'grid-like' and concentrated within a much smaller range of RSSI
        (±3bm) and high SNR (+10db).
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Hotspot Witness Graph

The graph shows a central Hotspot, the Hotspot’s immediate witnesses, and other witnesses
connections within a 10 km range. Each line indicates a witness connection between two Hotspots.
Hotspot owners are represented by unique colors, where Hotspots owned by the same Wallet address
will be displayed in the same color.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Legitimate Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="crowdspot-chart img-center"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-graph-legit-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        The central Hotspot's witnesses vary with placement and the natural terrain of the area.
        These witness connections are more random and feature a wider variety of Hotspot owners.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Abnormal Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="crowdspot-chart img-center"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-graph-sus-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        The central Hotspot can only see a specific subset of Hotspots. This is illustrated by a
        sphere-like containment of Hotspots witnessing only each other but failing to connect
        outside the containment. There may be less variation of Hotspot owners in an abnormal
        cluster.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Witness RSSI versus Distance

As the distance between Hotspots increases, the received signal strength (RSSI) decreases due to
environmental factors. Signal strength ranges between -136 to -80 dBm, with -90 to -110 dBm is a
very strong RSSI (unlikely in real life), while -130 dBm is very weak. Similarly, a high R² value
indicates strong correlation and goodness of fit.

<div class="container" style={{ padding: 0, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Legitimate Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="crowdspot-chart img-center"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-rssi-distance-legit-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        A Hotspot's Witness RSSI compared to distance has a weak “fit” seen through the larger
        deviations from the curve. This results in a low R² value closer to 0.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6" style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
      <b>Abnormal Hotspot</b>
      <img
        className="crowdspot-chart img-center"
        src={useBaseUrl('img/crowdspot/witness-rssi-distance-sus-example.png')}
      />
      <p>
        A Hotspot's Witness RSSI compared to distance has a predictable, strong “fit” with minimal
        deviations from the curve. This results in a high R² value close to 1, suggesting few
        effects from environmental factors.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Evaluation Process

Hotspots in a submission are evaluated on a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not
limited to Trust Scores, community provided text reasoning, and data found on
[Crowdspot.io](http://Crowdspot.io), including graph metrics, Witness Maker Diversity, and Location
Confidence.

### Submission Status

A submission is given a status to update the community on it’s evaluation progress.

#### Pending

This is the default state of a submission.

> In this state, the Denylist Maintainers are working on evaluating the submission.

#### Accepted

This state indicates that the submission request has been accepted.

> The Hotspots in this submission are either in the Denylist or will be added in the next version.

#### Declined

This state indicates that the submission request has been declined.

> This may happen when Hotspots requested to be added are found to be legitimate or when Hotspots
> that have been requested to be removed cannot be proven to be legitimate.

### Trust Score

Crowdspot will leverage algorithms to increase efficiency and accurately detect gaming Hotspots.
Trust Scores will be assigned to every submitted Hotspot to assist in the evaluation.

A Trust Score is a score assigned to Hotspot based on a combination of metrics found on
[Crowdspot.io](http://crowdspot.io/). These metrics are primarily graph data and include the Hotspot
Witness graph, the Witness SNR vs. RSSI graph, and the Witness RSSI vs. Distance graph.

The Trust Score compares these graph metrics to a sample of known gaming Hotspots from the Denylist,
as well as a sample of known legitimate Hotspots, to determine the relative legitimacy of the
Hotspot.

---

## Issues Currently on GitHub

Current issues on GitHub will continue to be evaluated. Therefore, if you currently have an issue on
GitHub, there is no need to re-submit your request on Crowdspot.io.

:::info What will happen to the Denylist repository on GitHub?

While the community will no longer be able to open an issue, Pull Requests will remain on Github
with multi-signature verification for the time being.

Hotspots submitted on Crowdspot will be pushed to the Denylist via GitHub.
