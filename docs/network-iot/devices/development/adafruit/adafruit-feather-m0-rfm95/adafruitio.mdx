## Adafruit IO Guide with Adafruit Feather M0 RFM95

## Introduction to Guide

:::important

Before we begin, please make sure you've followed the steps from the Console quickstart
[here](/console/quickstart). This will ensure you have a Console account and have created a new
device.

:::

## Objective and Requirements

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Connect your hardware
- Setup your firmware environment
- Program a basic application that will send packets over the Helium Network
- Verify real-time packets sent to the Helium Console via Hotspot that's in range
- Create an AdafruitIO integration and attach to device

For this example, you will need the following:

### Hardware

- [Adafruit Feather M0 - RFM95](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178)
- [DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385)
- Micro USB Type B Cable -
  [Example](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0719H12WD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?)
- Jumper cables

### Software

- [Arduino software \(IDE\)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)

## Hardware Setup

This step will cover adding an antenna, jumping pins on the LoRaWAN radio, and finally wiring the
DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. Below is a breadboard wiring diagram that you can reference
for your setup.

    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-adafruitio-breadboard.png',
  )}
/>

### Adding the Antenna

Please visit Adafruit's Documentation for antenna options and instructions
[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-radio-with-lora-radio-module/antenna-options).

### Jumping IO1 to Pin6

In order to use the RFM95 radio module onboard the Feather M0 for LoRaWAN we'll need to connect two
pins together. The pins are labeled `io1` and `6` on the board, as shown below. If you have the
headers soldered on, you can use a female to female jumper cable to connect them, or you can simply
solder a wire from pin to pin.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-jumper-pins.jpg',
  )}
/>

### Wiring the DHT22 Sensor

Connect the signal pin `2` of the DHT22 sensor to pin `12` on the feather board. You will also need
to add a pull up resister (20-50k) between the signal pin `2` of the DHT22 sensor and the 3.3V
supply. Last, connect the power(3.3V or 5V) and ground pins. Please reference the breadboard diagram
above.

## Software Setup

  )}
/>

#### Update IBM LMIC framework config.h

This library requires that a config file be setup properly. After you have installed the
`IBM LMIC framework` library, navigate to its directory on your operating system found below. Next,
replace the `config.h` file in this directory with this
[config.h](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Adafruit-Feather-M0-RFM95/longfi-us915/config.h)
file.

linux: /home/\{user\}/Arduino/libraries/IBM_LMIC_framework/src/lmic windows:
Documents/Arduino/libraries/IBM_LMIC_framework/src/lmic mac os:
Documents/Arduino/libraries/IBM_LMIC_framework/src/lmic

### Programming Example Sketch

Now that we have the required Arduino board support and library installed, lets program the board
with the provided example sketch.

To create a new Arduino sketch, open your Arduino IDE, \(**File &gt; New\).** Next, replace the
template sketch with the sketch found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Adafruit-Feather-M0-RFM95/longfi-us915-cayenne-dht22/longfi-us915-cayenne-dht22.ino),
copy and paste the entirety of it.

Next we'll need to fill in the AppEUI\(lsb\), DevEUI\(lsb\), and AppKey\(msb\), in the sketch, which
you can find on the device details page on Console. Be sure to use the formatting buttons to match
the endianness and formatting required for the sketch, shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-console-keys.png',
  )}
/>

At the top of the sketch, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with the matching field from
Console, example shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-arduino-sketch-keys.png',
  )}
/>

### Selecting Board

Next, we need to select the correct board to build for in the Arduino IDE. Navigate to \(**Select
Tools &gt; Board: &gt; Adafruit Feather M0\).**

### Enter Bootloader Mode

Next, we need to place the board into bootloader mode, which allows us to update it with new
firmware. To do this, first plug the device into your computer, make sure the power switch is turned
on \(you should see a red LED on\). Next, quickly double click the reset push button on the top side
of the board, you should see the red LED slowly blink. If you see this then you have successfully
entered bootloader mode.

### Selecting Port

We're almost ready to upload our sketch, the very last step is to select the correct Serial port in
the Arduino IDE. Navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: Adafruit Feather M0**\). You will also see either
**COM\# or /dev/ttyACM\#** depending on whether you are on Windows, Mac, or Linux. If you do not see
a port, please visit the Drivers section in
[Adafruit's Docs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-radio-with-lora-radio-module/using-with-arduino-ide#install-drivers-windows-7-and-8-only-6-11)
to make sure you have what's needed for your operating system.

### Upload Sketch

We're finally ready to upload our sketch to the board. In the Arduino IDE, click the right arrow
button, or navigate to \(**Sketch &gt; Upload\),** to build and upload your new firmware to the
board. You should see something similar to the image below at the bottom of your Arduino IDE, when
the upload is successful.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-arduino-terminal.png',
  )}
/>

### Viewing Serial Output

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining the network. Let's
use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output from the board. We first need to select
the serial port again, but this time it will be a **different port** than the one we selected to
communicate with the bootloader. Once again, navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: Adafruit Feather
M0**\), but make sure the serial device, either COM\# or ttyACM\#, is different! Next navigate to
\(**Tools &gt; Serial Monitor**\), you should begin to see output similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-arduino-serial.png',
  )}
/>

Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and look at our device page, you
should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-console-event-graph.png',
  )}
/>

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next step is to create
and attach the AdafruitIO integration.

## Adafruit IO

Next we'll create and attach the Adafruit IO integration.

You can sign up for a free account at [https://io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com/).

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **Adafruit IO** integration as shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-select-adafruitio.png')} />

The next step is to enter your Adafruit IO username and key. These can be found by visiting
[https://io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com/) and clicking _MyKey_ in the top right corner as
shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-adafruitio-mykey.png')} />

You will then be presented with both your username and key as shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-adafruitio-get-user-key.png')} />

Copy these values into the username and key fields in Console for the integration configuration
shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-adafruitio-enter-user-key.png')} />

Last for this step, you can optionally change the group name that is set to `{{device_id}}` by
default. The group name is used to group one or more data values that is received from a device and
sent to AdafruitIO in a single message. This name is used as the default because it is guaranteed to
be unique for every Helium device. You can use any of the available template tags which are auto
populated when messages are actually sent, which are `{{device_id}}`, `{{device_eui}}`, and
`{{device_name}}`. This integration uses group topics to send device data to AdafruitIO over MQTT,
you can read more about it [here](https://io.adafruit.com/api/docs/mqtt.html#group-topics).

Next let's name the integration in step 3, you will use this name later to identify the integration
when attaching it to devices.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-adafruitio-label.png')} />

The very last step is to select the decoder that will be used to decode the data payload received
from your device. We will be using the _CayenneLPP_ decoder as shown below and encoding the sensor
data with CayenneLPP. Last be sure to click _Create Integration_ to finish.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/integrations/integrations-adafruitio-choose-decoder.png')} />

### Connecting AdafruitIO Integration to Device

Now that we have our integration created, the last step is to attach the label to our device. To do
this, navigate your device page and click the `Add Label` button shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-console-add-label.png',
  )}
/>

Search for the AdafruitIO label, select, and finally click Add Label.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-console-select-label.png',
  )}
/>

You should now see your data appearing on Adafruit IO under Feeds as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/adafruit/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95/adafruit-feather-m0-rfm95-adafruitio-feeds.png',
  )}
/>

That completes this guide!
