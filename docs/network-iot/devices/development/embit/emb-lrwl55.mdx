## EMB-LRWL55

EMB-LRWL55 is the first ultra-low-power LoRaWAN® OEM module based on STM's new system-on-chip,
STM32WL55xx. Its tiny form factor and its capability of working both with 868MHz EU ISM band and
915MHz US make EMB-LRWL55 the perfect solution for small and battery powered LoRaWAN® end-devices,
with the possibility to interface any kind of sensors.
