  )}
/>

### Manual updates to the Heltec runtime libraries

Some versions of Heltec's runtime libraries have set default configuration variables to values that
are incompatible with the Helium network, especially when the Heltec device is configured targeting
the North American market.

The following discusses two Heltec runtime files that must be inspected to ensure compatibility. The
exact location of these files will depend on which operating system you are using, Windows, Linux,
or Mac as well as where the Arduino IDE is installed.

The typical top-level locations of the runtime libraries is shown below for each operating system.
From there the following discussions will present to you the file locations within these top-level
directories/folders. Please note the Heltec library version numbers are expected to change as time
goes on.

XXXXX denotes your specfic user id.

##### Arduino IDE library location

- Windows

```text
C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\CubeCell\hardware\CubeCell\1.0.0
```

- Linux

```text
/home/XXXXX/.arduino15/packages/CubeCell/hardware/CubeCell/1.0.0
```

- Mac

```text
/Users/XXXXX/Library/Arduino15/packages/CubeCell/hardware/CubeCell/1.0.0
```

#### Verify LoRaWAN Data Rate

Within an editor of your choice open the file path formed by prepending the above described platform
specific top level directory structure to the following file:

```text
libraries/LoRa/src/LoRaWan_APP.cpp    (Linux/Mac)
libraries\LoRa\src\LoRaWan_APP.cpp     (Windows)
```

Within this file look for

```
#define defaultDrForNoAdr
```

Depending on the version of the Heltec runtime that is installed this default may be set to DR_0,
DR_3, DR_5 or some other value. Note: DR_5 is not valid for US915, the North American market.

The defaultDrForNoAdr setting is tied directly to the maximum size of the data packet you are
transferring.

NOTE: If you try to transfer a packet that is larger than this setting allows, your device may
successfully join the network but the data transmitted will fail silently.

| Data Rate \(DR\) | Max Application Payload |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- |
| DR_0             | 11 bytes                |
| DR_1             | 53 bytes                |
| DR_2             | 125 bytes               |
| DR_3             | 242 bytes               |
| DR_4             | 242 bytes               |
| DR_5 - 7         | Not Valid               |

Update the defaultDrForNoAdr as appropriate for your application needs.

The above values are valid for the US902-928MHz region\(North America\), the values may differ for
other LoRa regions, which you can find
[here](https://resources.lora-alliance.org/document/rp2-1-0-1-lorawan-regional-parameters).

#### Dynamic Data Rate Change

If your application needs to change the current uplink data rate dynamically and Adaptive Data Rate
(ADR) is not enabled, one can call the

```
LoRaWAN.setDataRateForNoADR(int8_t dataRate)
```

API within your sketch. If you do call this API it must be called after the LoRaWAN.init() within
your sketch for the change to be effective.

#### LoRaWAN preamble size

There are some versions of the Heltec runtime libraries that may set a LoRaWAN preamble size that is
incompatible with the current LoRaWan specification. If the preamble size is not set correctly your
device cannot join the network.

This should be verified in the region-specific file corresponding to the region your device is
targeting. Be sure to prepend the above described platform-specific top-level directory structure.

The following is the file that must be checked if targeting region US915. Within an editor of your
choice open the file path formed by prepending the above described platform-specific top-level
directory structure to the following file:

```text
cores/asr650x/loramac/mac/region/RegionUS915.c     (Linux/Mac)
cores\asr650x\loramac\mac\region\RegionUS915.c     (Windows)
```

Within this file locate the line below, the 7th parameter which might be 14 should be changed to
either 8 or 16. Either value will work. Earlier versions of the runtime may have this value set to
14 which is "not" correct.

Change:

```text
Radio.SetTxConfig( MODsEM_LORA, phyTxPower, 0, bandwidth, phyDr, 1, 14, false, true, 0, 0, false, 3e3 );
```

To:

```text
Radio.SetTxConfig( MODEM_LORA, phyTxPower, 0, bandwidth, phyDr, 1, 8, false, true, 0, 0, false, 3e3 );
```

Heltec support has been notified of these issues. Hopefully, a future release of those libs will
resolve the issues.

### Install Serial Driver

Find Directions on Heltec's website
[here](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/establish_serial_connection.html).

### Set Project Configuration Options

The following options are set via the Arduino IDE Tools menu:

#### Select Board

If you are using the HTCC-AB02 flavor of Heltec board

- Select Tools -&gt; Board: -&gt;CubeCell-Board \(HTCC-AB02\)

If you are using the HTCC-AB02S GPS-enabled flavor of Heltec board

- Select Tools -&gt; Board: -&gt;CubeCell-GPS \(HTCC-AB02S\)

#### Select LoraWAN Configuration Options

Arduino IDE: Until you are familiar with their configuration behavior it is recommended you set the
board options as follows:

- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_REGION: -&gt; REGION_US915
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_CLASS: -&gt; CLASS_A
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_NETMODE: -&gt; OTTA
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_ADR: -&gt; OFF
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_UPLINKMODE: -&gt; UNCONFIRMED
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_Net_Reservation: -&gt; OFF
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_AT_SUPPORT: -&gt; OFF
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_AT_RGB : -&gt; ACTIVE
- Select Tools -&gt; LoRaWan\_ Debug Level : -&gt; FREQ&&DIO \(for most verbose messages\)

### Programming **Example Sketch**

Now that we have the required Arduino board support and library installed, lets program the board
with the provided example sketch.

To create a new Arduino sketch, open your Arduino IDE, \(**File &gt; New\).** Next, replace the
template sketch with the sketch found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/longfi-us915/longfi-us915.ino),
copy and paste the entirety of it.

Next we'll need to fill in the AppEUI\(msb\), DevEUI\(msb\), and AppKey\(msb\), in the sketch, which
you can find on the device details page on Console. Be sure to use the formatting buttons to match
the endianess and formatting required for the sketch, shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-console-details.png',
  )}
/>
)

At the top of the sketch, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with the matching field from
Console, example shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-console-keys.png',
  )}
/>

### Upload Sketch

We're finally ready to upload our sketch to the board. In the Arduino IDE, click the right arrow
button, or navigate to \(**Sketch &gt; Upload\),** to build and upload your new firmware to the
board. You should see something similar to the image below at the bottom of your Arduino IDE, when
the upload is successful.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-arduino-upload.png',
  )}
/>
)

### Using HTCC-AB02S Board With GPS Capable Sketch <a id="HTCC-AB02S-with-GPS"></a>

If you are using the HTCC-AB02S board with a sketch that is GPS enabled but find the device is
unable to obtain a GPS lock you can try changing the GPS data satellite source via the GPS class
Air530.setMode\(\) API. Add the Air530.setmode\(\) to the setup\(\) method of your sketch.

```text
// MODE_GPS - US,
// MODE_GPS_BEIDOU - Chinese - This is the default
// MODE_GPS_GLONASS - Russian
// set what works best for your connectivity, for example:
Air530.setmode(MODE_GPS);
```

### Patching ADR Functionality

The CubeCell may have issues joining the network with ADR OFF. If you're using ADR ON, you may also
encounter an issue where your CubeCell stops successfully sending packets after a few minutes. This
is caused by the CubeCell firmware's ADR behavior, and may happen if your payload is above the DR0
maximum size \(11 bytes\).

To patch the CubeCell firmware, find and open the `RegionUS915.c` file in the firmware directory. On
macOS, an example path would be
`~/Library/Arduino15/packages/CubeCell/hardware/CubeCell/1.0.0/cores/asr650x/loramac/mac/region/RegionUS915.c`.

Find the following lines in the file and comment them out:

```text
// Decrease the datarate
getPhy.Attribute = PHY_NEXT_LOWER_TX_DR;
getPhy.Datarate = datarate;
getPhy.UplinkDwellTime = adrNext->UplinkDwellTime;
phyParam = RegionUS915GetPhyParam(&getPhy);
datarate = phyParam.Value;
```

This will prevent the CubeCell from reducing the Data Rate over time and allow you to send larger
packets on a repeated, prolonged basis.

### Viewing Serial Output <a id="viewing-serial-output"></a>

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining the network. Let's
use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output from the board. We first need to select
the serial port again, but this time it will be a **different port** than the one we selected to
communicate with the bootloader. Once again, navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: COM\#/ttyACM\#**\),
but make sure the serial device, either COM\# or ttyACM\#, is different! Next navigate to \(**Tools
&gt; Serial Monitor**\), you should begin to see output similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-arduino-serial.png',
  )}
/>
)

Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) and look at our device page,
you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-console-event-graph.png',
  )}
/>

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next step is to learn how
to use your device data to build applications, visit our Integrations docs
