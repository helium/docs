## MKR WINDY

MKR WINDY is an Arduino MKR1000 form factor board based on the Midatronics WINDY Module, an IoT
module with onboard uFL connector based on the ST Microelectronics STM32WL, System-On-Chip
integrates both a general-purpose microcontroller and a sub-GHz radio on the same chip. Built on an
Arm® Cortex®‐M4 core architecture, STM32WL microcontrollers also support multiple modulations –
LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK, BPSK – to ensure flexibility in wireless applications with LoRaWAN®, Sigfox®
or any other suitable protocol in a fully open way. The windy module features a sub-GHz radio
based-on Semtech SX126x to meet the requirements of a wide range of Low-Power Wide Area Network
(LPWAN) wireless applications in industrial and consumer Internet-of-Things (IoT).
