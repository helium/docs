## Windy Module

The Windy Module is an IoT module with onboard uFL connector based on the ST Microelectronics
STM32WL, System-On-Chip integrates both a general purpose microcontroller and a sub-GHz radio on the
same chip. Built on an Arm® Cortex®‐M4 core architecture, STM32WL microcontrollers also support
multiple modulations – LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK, BPSK – to ensure flexibility in wireless applications
with LoRaWAN® , Sigfox® or any other suitable protocol in a fully open way. The windy module
features a sub-GHz radio based-on Semtech SX126x to meet the requirements of a wide range of
Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) wireless applications in industrial and consumer
Internet-of-Things (IoT).
