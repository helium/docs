# Getting started with Helium and PlatformIO

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework,
professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications
for embedded products.

:::important

Before we begin, please make sure you've followed the steps from this guide, which goes over some
initial setup steps.

:::

## Introduction to Guide

This guide will walk through installing PlatformIO and deploying a Helium Arduino program on a
target device. Here, as an example, we will detail the steps required to integrate a specific board
type, the [RAKwireless WisBlock](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock) family of boards.

However, this guide can be also used to on-board many other types of target devices. In most cases
one can just substitute your target device in place of the WisBlock developer board.

## Objective and Requirements

In this guide, you will learn:

- How to setup your PlatformIO IDE environment
- How to create, build, upload a simple embedded application
- How to program a basic application that will send packets over the Helium Network
- Verify real-time packets sent to the Helium Console via Hotspot that's in range

For this example, we are going to use the
[RAKwireless WisBlock Starter Kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-starter-kit).
This procedure should work as a starting point if your particular device contains more of the
WisBlock components. Follow on RAKwireless products may work but have not been tested at this point.

### Hardware

- [RAKwireless WisBlock Starter Kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-starter-kit)
- Micro USB Type B Cable -
  [Example](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0719H12WD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?)

### Software

PlatformIO is not a standalone IDE, it installs as an extension to Microsoft VSCode. The Helium
Console is a cloud based device management tool that we will use to enable our device access to the
Helium network. There is no installation required however one will need to create a user account
with the Helium Console.

- [VSCode \(IDE)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [PlatformIO \(VScode Extension)](https://platformio.org/)
- [Helium Console](/console)

## Hardware Setup

### Attaching the LoRa and BLE Antennas

Your WisBlock Starter Kit should have come with two U.FL antenna.

- the one that resembles an "I" is the LoRa antenna, this one connects to the connector on the core
  module marked LoRa, which is below the large K in the RAK logo.
- the one that resembles a "T" is the BLE antenna, this one connects to the connector on the core
  module marked BLE

### Connect Target Board to Development PC<a id="connect-board"></a>

The target boards are typically connected to the host computer via a USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro B
cable.

## Software Setup <a id="software-setup"></a>

### Install Development Machine Serial Device Driver

Some operating systems, especially Windows, may require the installation of hardware specific USB
device driver code. In general it's best to just try to upload a built application before installing
new device drivers. If the upload fails and you believe it is a device driver issue refer to the
WisBlock support forum for the most up to date information.
[RAKwireless Support Forum](https://forum.rakwireless.com/).

### Installing PlatformIO

The WisBlock Starter Kit is not currently supported by PlatformIO out of the box. One must install
VSCode/PlatformIO and then take some extra steps to add support for WisBlock.

This guide will walk you through the following basic steps to get a simple Helium enabled embedded
application up and running. The steps will include

- install VSCode and the PlatformIO extension
- install the Nordic nRF52 Arduino framework
- Implement patch files for RAK WisBlock Core boards
- Add WisBlock Core RAK4631 Variants Definition Files to PlatformIO
- create a new PlatformIO project
- prove out the install via a sample RAKwireless WisBlock project
- add a project dependency library, SX126x-Arduino
- integrate your device specific Helium network configuration keys, Device EUI, APPEUI, APPKEY which
  you obtain from the Helium console device definition.
- add your target LoRaWAN region defines to the platformio.ini configuration file
- compile and upload the device application

#### Install VSCode and PlatformIO Extension

Using the VSCode instructions found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) download and install
Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. PlatformIO IDE is built on top of VSCode as an extension. Once the
VSCode is installed:

1. Open VSCode Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions icon on the left side of the main
   view.
2. Within the Extensions Marketplace search for official "PlatformIO IDE" extension
3. Click on the "Install" button contained within the PlatformIO IDE item
4. Addtional details for the PlatformIO extension can be found
   [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-platformio-exten.png',
  )}
/>

It is highly recommended to give the PlatformIO quick-start guide a read. It will help you navigate
the unfamiliar interface. The guide can be found
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#quick-start).

Once PlatformIO is installed, you should be welcomed to VSCode with the following "PIO Home" screen:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-platformio-welcome.png',
  )}
/>

If not already open, the PlatformIO "Home" view can be opened by clicking on the house icon within
the VScode status bar.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-home-button.png',
  )}
/>

### Updating PlatformIO to Support the WisBlock Developer Board

#### Install Nordic nRF52 Arduino framework

We now need to install the framework of WisBlock support libraries.

Select the "Platforms" icon located on the left side of the PIO Home view. In the "Filter Platforms
by Name" field, enter "Nordic" as follow:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-install-platform-1.png',
  )}
/>

You may see there are several items, just select the "Nordic nRF52" item and then select "Install"
as seen below:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-install-platform-2.png',
  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-install-platform-3.png',
  )}
/>
When complete you should see a successful install message such as the one above.

#### Implement patch files for RAK WisBlock Core boards

Download the PlatformIO folder from:

https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/PlatformIO/

and save it on your computer.

From the downloaded folder copy the file **`wiscore_rak4631.json`** to the boards folder of the
nordicnrf52 platform folder.

The path should be similar to:

```
Windows: %USER%\.platformio\platforms\nordicnrf52\boards
Linux:    ~/.platformio/platforms/nordicnrf52/boards
Mac OS:  /Users/{Your_User_id}/.platformio/platforms/nordicnrf52/boards
```

#### Add WisBlock Core RAK4631 Variants Definition Files to PlatformIO

Now, from the folder downloaded above, copy the complete "WisCore_RAK4631_Board" folder into
PlatformIO's packages/framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52/variants folder. The path should be similar to:

```
Windows: %USER%\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52\variants
Linux: ~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52/variants
Mac OS: /Users/{Your_User_id}/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52/variants
```

When complete you will have a new sub folder under variants called "WisCore_RAK4631_Board".

#### Restart PlatformIO

This completes the necessary WisBlock updates to PlatformIO. To fully implement these changes
shutdown, then restart PlatformIO

### Creating a New PlatformIO Project

If you have not already used PlatformIO to build, upload and verify the operation of a sample
application it is best familiarize yourself with the basic use of PlatformIO before adding the
complexity of Helium network access code to the mix.

If you are familiar and confident with the steps required you can continue at "Sample Helium Network
Access Code" by clicking [here](#add-helium-network-code).

#### Prove out the install with a sample non Helium project

To avoid too many unknowns when first starting out, the following will create, build and upload a
non Helium Network device applications. Once the basics are proven we will add more complexity by
introducing code that will access the Helium LoRaWAN network. The following steps will walk you
through what is required to:

- create a template project
- inspect the default source file, main.cpp as well as the primary project configuration file,
  platformio.ini
- build the project and inspect the build log output
- upload the sample binary to the target development board.
- inspect serial output debug information.

#### Open "New Project Wizard" - Select project name and board

- Within the "PIO Home" view click on "New Project".

- At the "Project Wizard" dialog enter a name for your project in the "Name" field.
- Within the "Board" field select the appropriate target board by entering the name of the board,
  "WisCore" for our example. The PlatformIO auto search feature should present you with a known list
  of supported boards. In our case we should see "WisCore RAK4631 Board (RAKwireless)" presented as
  a selection.
- For the "Framework" selection some devices will support more than one framework within PlatformIO,
  for our WisBlock example make sure "Arduino" is selected.

  <img
    src={useBaseUrl(
      'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-wizard-board.png',
    )}
  />

- With the Project Wizard items filled in, click on Finish to start the project creation.

The time taken to create a project will vary depending on whether or not the selected platform and
framework files have been previously downloaded. When the project has been created it should be
shown, as seen below, within the PlatformIO Explorer view typically found on the left side of the
IDE.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-wizard-complete.png',
  )}
/>

Typical project explorer view.

#### Default project main.cpp

If you are familiar developing within the Arduino IDE, main.cpp is much the same as the Arduino
\*.ino. It also contains default setup() and loop() functions.

PlatformIO also adds a required `\#include <Arduino.h\>` statement. This is an important/necessary
difference between PlatformIO and Arduino IDEs.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-main-cpp.png',
  )}
/>

#### platformio.ini - project configurations

Let's take a look at the platformio.ini file in the root of our new project. This is where one
defines project configuration definitions. In the Arduino world one would do this via the IDE tool
bar selections.

NOTE: when this file is modified the entire project will be rebuilt when the project is next built
or uploaded.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-platformio-ini.png',
  )}
/>

Here we see the platformio.ini file that was created as a result of the running the New Project
wizard targeting our WisBlock board.

#### Build the target device application

Now that the template project has been created it's time to build the device application. Within
PlatformIO the "Build" button is the check-mark found within the bottom status bar. Clicking on this
button should start the build process.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-build-button.png',
  )}
/>

#### Inspect the build output

Due to the defines within platformio.ini, PlatformIO is able to determine the project board and
framework dependencies. Any missing dependencies are automatically installed at build time, thus
this process may be seen in the build output. This feature allows us to add libraries into our
platformio.ini file, which will then be downloaded for us, if needed, at build time.

The build process results can be found within the "Terminal View" typically found at the bottom of
the VSCode window. Much like with Arduino, the build output will dump the calculated amount of Ram
and Flash memory used by your application.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-build-output-1.png',
  )}
/>

Start of the build output displaying configuration information.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-build-output-2.png',
  )}
/>

Tail end of build log showing Ram and Flash usage. There is also a Problems output view that may
help when trying to resolve build issues.

#### List of attached devices

For this sections please make sure your target device is connected to your development computer.

If, within the "PIO Home" view, you select the "Devices" icon on the left, you will see listed any
attached physical devices as well as their associated comm ports:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-devices.png',
  )}
/>

The list should reflect your target device. The exact content will vary depending which operating
system PlatformIO is being executed on.

#### Uploading binary to target device

Now that the code has built successfully, if a target device is attached to your computer the
resulting binary can be uploaded to the target device.

The method of uploading the binary to your device may vary depending on the target device.
PlatformIO will attempt to configure upload options appropriate for the chosen board. If the default
configuration does not work in your instance detailed information can be found within the PlatformIO
documentation
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env_upload.html?highlight=upload)
or within your target board vendors documentation set.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-upload-button.png',
  )}
/>

Click on the Upload button within the bottom Status bar.

Below you will see a typical output as the binary is uploaded to the target board.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-upload.png',
  )}
/>

```
NOTE:
 With some target devices PlatformIO will
 automatically close any open comm port connection.
 An upload error may occur if for some reason the
 comm port cannot be closed. If this is the case you
 must manually close down the terminal emulator's
 connection before retrying the upload.
```

Now that the application has been uploaded you can connect your favorite terminal emulator to the
comm port seen in the list of devices above. Because the above sample project is an empty project
you will not see any addition output via the terminal emulator output unless you customize the
sample with debug output statements.

Additional RAKwireless supported WisBlock sample code can be found at
[https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples)

If you have made it this far then we know your environment can build and upload a device
application. Now it's time to connect to the Helium network.

### Helium Console - Create Device

In order for a target device to communicate via the Helium Network a user account must first be
created. Once the user account is created then a console device must be created.

When creating the console device, make note of the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey device credentials.
These are used to connect to the network and will need to be inserted into the device application
code below. A console quick start guide can be found [here](/console/quickstart).

### Sample Helium Network Access Code {#add-helium-network-code}

If you have not created a simple template project and you want to try one of the samples you can
copy a sample into your workspace where it should build without error. A full PlatformIO project can
be found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/tree/master/RAKWireless-WisBlock/examples/LoRaWan_OTAA).
Alternatively you can update the template project created above by continuing the following steps.

#### Update main.cpp

Now that we have the minimum required board and library runtime support installed, let's program the
board with an example Helium network enabled application.

To update the sample application created above:

- open, within PlatformIO, your projects src/main.cpp file
- replace this template main.cpp with the content of the sample application found
  [here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/RAKWireless-WisBlock/examples/LoRaWan_OTAA/src/main.cpp).
  Copy and paste the entirety of it.

#### Add WisBlock LoRaWan Support Library to Project

The WisBlock LoraWan support library is not fully integrated into PlatformIO at this point. It must
be included within each WisBlock project. This is accomplished by:

- Open the PlatformIO:Home view by selecting the "house" button located on the VSCode status bar
- Select the "Libraries" icon on the left side of the "PlatformIO:Home" view
- within the "Search libraries" field enter "SX126x-Arduino" and hit the enter key
- When presented with the library entry, click on it.
- Click on the highlighted "Add to Project" button
- In the dialog that pops up, select the project into which you want to include the library, then
  click on the "Add" button

This process will add a library dependency line into the platformio.ini file similar to:

```
lib_deps = beegee-tokyo/SX126x-Arduino@^1.3.1
```

The dependent libraries are also installed into the selected project within it's .pio/libdes
directory.

#### Add device credentials

Next we'll need replace the placeholder AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey values found within the sample
program with the real values found on the target device page within the Helium Console.

```
NOTE:
 The endianess required for these credentials varies
 depending on the LoRaWAN runtime library implementation.
 Using a custom library implementation will require an
 understanding of that libraries endian requirement, big
 endian or little endian.
```

For our WisBlock example all values are big endian \(msb\), most significant bit on the left.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-console-details.png',
  )}
/>

At the top of the main.cpp file, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with the matching field
from the Helium Console, example shown below. Your numbers will be different depending on what the
console creates when you add your target device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-console-keys.png',
  )}
/>

#### Verify LoRaWAN channels mask

Runtime library implementations are designed to work across several LoRaWAN regions and networks.
The firmware will attempt to join the network using various frequency sub-bands, defined by a
channel mask, until the join succeeds. It is recommended that you change the default channel mask to
a value that will help the join process complete connection to the Helium network in a more timely
manner. The process, where and how, to update this channel mask will vary depending on the LoRaWAN
runtime implementation

For our example using the WisBlock and it's runtime the channel mask is set via a runtime API call.
The following piece of code can be incorporated into sample projects. Refer to a sample to determine
where this code should reside, generally just prior to the call to the join API call is fine.

```
/* Helium Network LoraWan sub channel 2 is recommended, default channels 0-7*/
 if (!lmh_setSubBandChannels(2))
 {
    Serial.println("lmh_setSubBandChannels() failed");
 }
```

#### A Note About Network Join Failures

Within the project main.cpp file there is the following define:

```
#define JOINREQ_NBTRIALS 10
```

This define is used by the runtime to determine how many times to attempt a LoRaWAN network join.
Once this number of join retries is exhausted the runtime will call a device application level
callback, if defined.

The runtime will no longer attempt to join the network once this callback has been called. It is
left to the device application to monitor via the join success and join fail callbacks the status of
the join process.

If your device application has or may have difficulty joining the network due to poor signal quality
the application will need to manage the join retries beyond the number defined by JOINREQ_NBTRIALS.
An example project which attempts to handle join failure retries can be found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/RAKWireless-WisBlock/examples/LoRaWan_OTAA_Join_Retry).

The currently supported device application level callbacks can be found within the sample
applications within the following define.

```
static lmh_callback_t lora_callbacks = { ... };
```

#### platformio.ini - project configurations

For our sample application we need a few configuration items added to the project platformio.ini
file. These include project defines, serial debug monitor configurations and debugger
configurations.

Complete documentation of platformio.ini content can be found
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/index.html). Serial debug monitor specific
items [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env_monitor.html).

For our example WisBlock project update the projects platformio.ini with the content from the sample
project:

- open, within PlatformIO, your projects platformio.ini file
- replace this template file with the content found
  [here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/RAKWireless-WisBlock/examples/LoRaWan_OTAA/platformio.ini).
  Copy and paste the entirety of it.

Once you have become more familiar with the LoRaWAN/Helium network feel free to experiment with
different configuration settings possible within platformio.ini.

NOTE: The comment character for this file type is the semicolon.

#### Build the device application

After updating the main.cpp and platformio.ini files it's time to build the device application.
Within PlatformIO the "Build" button is the check-mark found within the bottom status bar. Clicking
on this button should start the build process.

#### Inspect the build results

The build output results can be found within the "Terminal View" typically found at the bottom of
the VSCode window. Verify the build completed successfully.

#### Possible Arduino to PlatformIO porting issues

When porting Arduino sketches to PlatformIO you may find errors such as undefined functions. These
may be functions that are called by setup() or loop() or other custom functions prior to them being
defined. This is a side effect of the different C version of C compilers used with PlatformIO vs
Arduino. In this instance we just need to define the function prototype before the function is
actually called. Another compatibility issue is that unlike Arduino IDE, you must include Arduino.h
at the start of your C file if you are using Arduino defined constructs. Generally the compatibility
issues are minor.

#### Upload Binary to target device

If the build process completed successfully, upload the binary to the target device via the "Upload"
(right pointing arrow) button found on the status bar.

```
NOTE:
 With some target devices PlatformIO will
 automatically close any open comm port connection.
 An upload error may occur if for some reason the
 comm port cannot be closed. If this is the case you
 must manually close down the terminal emulator's
 connection before retrying the upload.
```

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-upload.png',
  )}
/>

Successful upload example, your results will vary.

#### Viewing Target Device Serial Output

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining the network. The
built-in PlatformIO Serial Monitor or any other virtual serial terminal emulator can be used to view
the serial debug output from the board.

If the built-in serial monitor is selected PlatformIO will attempt to connect to it automatically.
If using another terminal emulator refer to the Devices view as mentioned above to determine which
comm port your device is connected to.

To open the serial monitor click on the "Serial Monitor" button within the status bar.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-serial-monitor.png',
  )}
/>

You should begin to see output similar to below. This example uses VSCode's builtin virtual terminal
emulator.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-serial-debug.png',
  )}
/>

#### Helium Console Uplinks

Now let's head back to the [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) and login to your account.
Once logged in select the "Devices" item on the left, then select the target device previously
created. Scroll down a bit on the device page and you should see something similar to the screenshot
below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-console-event-graph.png',
  )}
/>

Activation messages are those seen when the device first attempts to join the network. Downlink
messages are those delivered from the network to your target device. Uplink messages are those
messages delivered from your target device to the Helium network.

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next step is to learn how
to use your device data to build applications, visit our integration docs
[here](/console/integrations).

### Device Application Code Debugging with PlatformIO

If, as is frequently the case, your application misbehaves VSCode/PlatformIO does support board
level debugging via various debug probes/interfaces. A general debug discussion can be found
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debugging.html) or debug probe specific discussion
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debugging.html#tools-debug-probes). PlatformIO
will attempt to seamlessly support your projects defined target board for debugging but with the
vast number of target boards, not all are supported out of the box.

PlatformIO supports out of the box debugging with the WisBlock developer board via the SWD ST-Link
protocol. To enable debugging add the following to your project platformio.ini file:

```
build_type = debug
upload_protocol = stlink
debug_tool = stlink
```

The ST-Link probe should connect to the SWDIO, SWCLK and GND pins of the Single Wire Debug pins as
marked on the WisBlock core board. Complete SWD/ST-Link operation is out of scope for this guide.

Then you can utilize the PlatformIO integrated debugging.

<img

    'img/network-iot/devices/development/rak-wisblock-starter/platformio/rak-wisblock-stlink.png',
  )}
/>
