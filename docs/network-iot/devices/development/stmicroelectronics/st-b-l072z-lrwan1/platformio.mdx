## Introduction

:::important

Before we begin, please make sure you've followed the steps from this guide, which goes over some
initial setup steps.

:::

### Objective and Requirements

In this guide, you will learn:

- What hardware and software are required

- Software required
- Where to find sample embedded application projects

For these examples, you will need the following:

### Hardware

- [STMicroelectronics B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html)
- Micro USB Type B Cable -
  [Example](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0719H12WD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?)

### Software

The following products are required.

- [VSCode \(IDE)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [PlatformIO \(VScode Extension)](https://platformio.org/)
- [Helium Console](https://www.helium.com/console)

### PlatformIO - An Easier Way to Develop Embedded Applications

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework,
professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications
for embedded products.

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)provides developers with a modern integrated development
environment
\([Cloud & Desktop IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/index.html#ide)\) that
works cross-platform, supports many different software development kits \(SDKs\) or
[Frameworks](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html#frameworks), and includes
sophisticated debugging
\([PIO Unified Debugger](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debugging.html#piodebug)\), unit
testing
\([PIO Unit Testing](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/unit-testing.html#unit-testing)\),
automated code analysis
\([PIO Check](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/pio-check.html#piocheck)\), and remote
management \([PIO Remote](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/pio-remote.html#pioremote)\).
It is architected to maximize flexibility and choice by developers, who can use either graphical or
command line editors
\([PlatformIO Core \(CLI\)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html#piocore)\), or
both.

If you are used to developing using the Arduino IDE but constantly feel constrained by the
environment, you are going to love what [PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)opens up for you.

This guide will walk through installing PlatformIO and deploying a Helium Arduino program on the ST
Discovery Development Kit. Let's do it.

### Installing PlatformIO

[Download ](https://code.visualstudio.com/)and install Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, PlatformIO
IDE is built on top of it.

1. Open VSCode Extension Manager
2. Search for official PlatformIO IDE extension
3. Install PlatformIO IDE.
   \([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)\)

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-exten.png',
  )}
/>

It is highly recommended to give the quick-start guide a read. It will help you navigate the new
interface.
[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html\#quick-start](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#quick-start)

In this tutorial, I will be using the
[Helium Developer Kit](https://developer.helium.com/devices/devkit).

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-boards.png',
  )}
/>

Once PlatformIO is installed, you should be welcomed to VSCode with the following "PIO Home" screen:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-home.png',
  )}
/>

### Starting a new PlatformIO Project

Let's click on "New Project" to get started.

Enter a project name and select the following board:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-wizard.png',
  )}
/>

We will be using the Arduino Framework, so go ahead and click "Finish".

This may take a bit on the first run, but you should soon be left with a project that looks as such:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-explorer.png',
  )}
/>

If we look into `src/main.cpp`, we see the familiar empty Arduino sketch structure:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-main-cpp.png',
  )}
/>

Let's take a second here to look at the `platformio.ini` file in the root of our new project:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-platformio-ini.png',
  )}
/>

Notice that we specify the environment that we are going to be developing in using the following
variables:

- platform
- board
- framework

At this point, you may click the **PlatformIO Build** checkbox in the status bar, and the project
will build \(just don't expect it to do anything yet\):

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-build-btn.png',
  )}
/>

You may notice something unexpected here \(but very cool, and we will get into that here in just a
bit\):

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-build-out-1.png',
  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-build-out-2.png',
  )}
/>

Above, PlatformIO "knew" what platform we were building on and installed what was necessary. This
will come in handy, as we can add libraries into our **`platformio.ini`** file, and they will be
added in at build time.

If, on the **PIO Home** page, you select the "Devices" icon on the left, you will see the physical
devices that are connected to your development machine, and what ports they are connected to:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-devices.png',
  )}
/>

Notice that under **Description**, it says we are running "JLink" rather than "ST-Link". If we were
to attempt to flash the board at this point, we would get a failure that looked like this:

```text

```

What happened here? Well, we have this board set up to use a `SEGGER JTAG` interface rather than the
`ST-Link` interface that is integrated into the Discovery board. There are a number of advantages of
this approach, and I would _highly_ suggest doing this. It will make your development iteration
process much faster.

Luckily, `SEGGER` has provided a method to \(non-destructively\) replace the ST-Link on our board
with a JTAG interface.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-upload-fail.png',
  )}
/>

[Head here](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/st-link-on-board/)
to walk through the simple process.

We then need to add one additional line to our `platformio.ini` file to let PlatformIO know that we
will be using a JTAG interface to our board \(written as `jlink` in your file\):

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-stlink-cvt.png',
  )}
/>

The next time we build and attempt to upload our project, we will be presented with the following
Terms of Use:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-upload-protcol.png',
  )}
/>

Accept this agreement, and you should see the following popup:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/development/st-b-l072z-lrwan1/platformio/st-disco-platformio-jlink-terms.png',
  )}
/>

And there you have it. At this point, we have successfully programmed an empty sketch onto our
Helium Developer Kit using PlatformIO! Check out the
[Helium LongFi PlatformIO repo](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio) for some example
programs to get you started.

**Go forth and build magical things.**
