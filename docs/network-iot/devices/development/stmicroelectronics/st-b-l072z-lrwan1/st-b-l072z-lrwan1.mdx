The ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRaWAN development board includes the popular
[Murata CMWX1ZZABZ-091](https://wireless.murata.com/type-abz-078.html) module, which is powered by a
[STM32L072CZ ](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l072cz.html)microcontroller
and [SX1276 ](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/sx1276)transceiver. The
board also includes a fully featured ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface, LEDs, push-buttons,
antenna, Arduino™ Uno V3 connectors and USB OTG connector in Micro-B format. Paired with the ST
X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 Sensor Expansion Board, this kit will enable you to rapidly develop and test your
end device applications on the Helium Network. To start transmitting data with the board, please see
