## Abeeway Geolocation Module

The Abeeway Geolocation Module is a multi-technology fused location LPWAN module designed as the
ideal platform to develop a wide range of IoT tracking solutions, minimizing the Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO) of IoT geolocation use cases. It allows your engineering to focus on the use case,
to optimize time-to-market and cost by using less complex PCBs (all high-density devices being
encapsulated), to reduce certification risk and budget, as well as testing time and cost for mass
production.
