<img src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/adeunis-field-test-device.png')} />

### Introduction

The Adeunis Field Test Device (ARF8124A LoRaWAN US902-928) is a great tool for network testing. It
allows you to rapidly test network coverage at specific geographical positions to verify that
devices will have coverage.

### Add Device to Console

To start, you'll need to add your device to Console. You should have been provided with a DevEUI,
AppEUI, and AppKey from the seller of the device. Follow our
[quickstart](/use-the-network/console/quickstart) for instructions on how to add a new device to
Console.

### Device Configuration

The following device configuration changes are required for the device to function properly on the
Helium Network. Although the Adeunis IoT Configurator application makes the device configuration
much easier, it does not allow you to change all the required settings, so we must use a serial
utility. We are using Realterm for our serial utility, but any will work, just be sure to use the
correct serial settings and send the commands in the correct format.

[Realterm - Serial Utility](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/)

#### Serial Settings

### Sending Packets

After exiting command mode and on every power on, the device will immediately attempt to join the
network. You will see the status of the join attempt on the Uplink/Downlink screen, please see the
manual for more details on this screen. Once the device has joined press the large push button in
the center of the device to send the uplink payload.
