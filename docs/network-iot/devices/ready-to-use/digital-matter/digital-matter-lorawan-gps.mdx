### Introduction

The [Digital Matter Oyster3](https://www.digitalmatter.com/devices/oyster-lorawan/) /
[Yabby Edge](https://www.digitalmatter.com/our-devices/yabby-edge/) are rugged IP68-rated
battery-powered GPS tracking devices. This guide will show you the hardware and software setup steps
required to provision and onboard these devices on the Helium Network.

Functionally, the Oyster3 and Yabby Edge are both battery-powered GPS tracking devices. Their main
differences lie in form factor and battery life.

[Yabby Edge LoRaWAN Configuration and Usage Guide](https://support.digitalmatter.com/support/solutions/articles/16000122827-yabby-edge-lorawan-configuration-and-usage-guide)
[LoRaWAN Provisioning Tool](https://www.oemserver.com/tools/LoRaWANProvisioningTool/setup.exe)

### Hardware

- Digital Matter Oyster3 / Yabby Edge
- 3 x AA Lithium (LiFeS2) or Lithium Thionyl Chloride (LTC) batteries \(Oyster3\)
- 2 x AAA Lithium (LiFeS2) batteries \(Yabby Edge\)
- DM-Link Wired Provisioning Cable for LoRaWAN devices

### Software

- [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)
- [LoRaWAN Provisioning Tool](https://www.oemserver.com/tools/LoRaWANProvisioningTool/setup.exe)
  \(Windows\)

### Hardware Setup

The Oyster3 takes 3 cells of AA battery; the Yabby Edge takes 2 cells of AAA battery.

The Oyster3 and the Yabby Edge both use the
[DM-Link Wired Provisioning Cable for LoRaWAN decives](https://www.digitalmatter.com/dmlink/).

Compatibility with the DM-Link Wired Provisioning Cable for older Digital Matter LoRaWAN devices can
be found at
[Wired Provisioning Tool](https://support.digitalmatter.com/support/solutions/articles/16000104317-wired-provisioning-tool).
On LoRaWAN devices, DM-Link is used to configure the region and JoinEUI to connect to a network. A
DM-Link can also be used to configure device parameters prior to deployment and update firmware and
Almanac data where applicable.

Once the devices have been provisioned and the batteries are populated, the enclosure can be sealed
by using the included screws.

That’s it for the hardware setup!

### Software Setup

The Oyster3 / Yabby Edge ship with a pre-provisioned AppEUI and AppKey. If you choose to use these
credentials, you can leave the AppEUI and AppKey fields blank in the Windows utility. If you would
like to provision the device with new credentials, you must copy the AppEUI and AppKey from the
device [created in Console](/console/adding-devices).

The basic parameters of interest are as follows:

```text
General:
In Trip Fix : hh:mm:ss : Will determine transmission frequency

Basic LoRaWAN:
	Region : US915 [1.0.2B]
	Sub-Band : 2 (ch. 8-15, 70)
	Activation : OTAA
	JoinEUI / AppEUI : [ Blank to use pre-provisioned / AppEUI from Console ]
	NwkKey (1.1) / AppKey (1.0) : [ Blank to use pre-provisioned / AppKey from Console ]

```

### Connecting your device

When you plug in your cable, your PC will assign it a COM port, which you can retrieve from the
Device Manager from the _**Ports \(COM & LPT\).**_

To access the device manager, press the Windows key on your keyboard and search for "Device
Manager".

##### Windows Device Manager

Select the corresponding port from the drop-down list in the top right of the utility and click
_**Start**_.

If the Program Firmware and Program Parameters boxes are left unchecked, the utility will
continuously read and display the current device settings without applying changes.

##### Current Device Settings and Transaction List

You can check logs by clicking the DevEUI List button on the top left, which will show a list of
scanned DevEUIs and transactions. Each time a device is programmed, the parameter list will flash,
and the DevEUI list will update. This list is available in CSV format, so it can be conveniently
imported into a spreadsheet.

To program the new parameters and firmware, enter the desired parameters in the right-hand column,
and check the corresponding boxes to update _**firmware**_ and/or _**parameters**._ When you are
finished, you may hit _**Stop**_, and disconnect your device.

Once the device has been configured, it will attempt to join the Helium Network by transmitting join
requests. If the device has been configured properly in Console and has knowledge of the device’s
AppEUI and AppKey, the Hotspot that hears the join request will send a join-accept message and allow
the device to join the Network and transmit data.

### Usage

These devices use an accelerometer to detect movement, allowing it to decide when an asset is
in-trip and when it is stationary. This allows it to schedule battery-hungry GPS fixes when
appropriate, to optimize battery life. Each time a status update is scheduled, the device will
attempt a GPS fix, then transmit results \(regardless of whether a fix succeeded or not\).

### Device Payload

A sample device payload is as follows:

```text
DCCF3816BF5046B70000D3
```

When decoded becomes:

```text
{
  "type": "position",
  "latitudeDeg": 37.282198,
  "longitudeDeg": -122.0128577,
  "inTrip": false,
  "fixFailed": false,
  "headingDeg": 0,
  "speedKmph": 0,
  "batV": 5.275,
  "manDown": null
}
```

To learn more about decoding this payload, you may use this
[utility](https://www.oemserver.com/tools/Oyster3LoRaWAN/oyster3-lr-html-decoder.html). To view the
JavaScript sample code, you can view source.

### Battery Life Estimate Calculator

Download the
[Oyster3 LoRaWAN Battery Life Estimate Calculator](https://support.digitalmatter.com/helpdesk/attachments/16084686136)

This spreadsheet will help estimate the approximate battery life of the Digital Matter Oyster3
LoRaWAN. Simply modify the fields to represent the desired number of transmissions within a day.

### myDevices/Cayenne Integration

Helium now supports myDevices and the Cayenne LPP \(Low Power Payload\) format. Cayenne is a
drag-and-drop IoT platform developed by myDevices, allowing developers, designers, and engineers to
quickly prototype and share their connected device projects.

To learn more about myDevices Cayenne integration, visit
[myDevices Cayenne](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/features/) and their
[documentation](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/intro/).

:::info

myDevices currently only includes the Digital Matter Oyster in their device library.

:::

When you are adding a device/widget in Cayenne, look for the **Digital Matter Oyster** under
**Helium**.

#### myDevices Cayenne - Adding a Digital Matter Oyster

Copy the device's **DevEUI** into the field. This value should correspond to the associated Digital
Matter Oyster DevEUI in **Console**. Then, click **Add device**.

That's it for adding a Digital Matter Oyster in myDevices Cayenne!
