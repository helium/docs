LSE01 -- LoRaWAN Soil Moisture & EC Sensor

The Dragino LSE01 is a LoRaWAN Soil Moisture & EC Sensor for IoT solutions in the field of
agriculture. It is designed to measure the soil moisture of saline-alkali soil and loamy soil. The
soil sensor uses the FDR method to calculate the soil moisture with compensation from soil
temperature and conductivity. It also has been calibrated in the factory for mineral soil type.
