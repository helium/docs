## Air Quality Monitor

The IoTsens Air Quality monitor consists of a set of environmental sensors capable of collecting
different variables to evaluate the conditions of the air that surrounds it. This device measures
the concentration of CO, SO2, NO2, O3, NO, H2S, CO2, the particles suspended in the air (PM1, PM2.5
and PM10) and TVOC. In addition, it also records environmental conditions such as temperature and
humidity. The use of this device is recommended for the evaluation of air conditions, being able to
monitor the levels of contamination to make the appropriate decisions.
