## Sound Monitor

The device can monitor noise levels due to its integrated microphone. It can analyze the surrounding
ambient sound A-weighted in the audible frequency spectrum for the human ear, showing the collected
data in dBA. Developed based on the guidelines set out in Directive 2002/49 / CE of the European
Parliament and of the Council, of June 25, 2002 and Law 37/2003 of November 17 published in the BOE
of Spain. This law aims to regulate noise pollution to avoid and, where appropriate, reduce the
damage it may cause to human health, property, or the environment.
