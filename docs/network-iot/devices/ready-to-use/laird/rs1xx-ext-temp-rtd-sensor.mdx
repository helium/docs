## Sentrius RS1xx External RTD Temperature Probe

Sentrius RS1xx External RTD Temperature Probe The Sentrius RS1xx External RTD Temperature Probe is a
battery-powered, long-range sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) connectivity. The RS1xx External RTD Temperature Probe serves specialized temperature
ranges for accurate temperature reading in extreme environments.

Low Temp (-100°C to +100°C): suited for cold-chain applications such as food safety, vaccine
storage, industrial cooling, etc. Mid Temp (-40°C to +180°C): suited for applications such as
industrial cookers and smokers, food safety, HVAC, etc. High Temp (-50°C to +450°C): suited for
applications such as extreme industrial applications, fryers, pizza ovens, etc.

Part no: #455-00103/#455-00104/#455-00105/#455-00106/#455-00108/#455-00109/#455-00110/#455-00111
