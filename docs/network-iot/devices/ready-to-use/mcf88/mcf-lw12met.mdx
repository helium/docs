MCF-LW12MET LoRaWAN Mono-Phase Metering

The MCF-LW12MET is a LoRaWAN Mono-Phase Meter that allows instantaneous reading of active, reactive
and apparent power, voltage and current up to 230 V AC - 16 Amp (active, reactive and apparent
energy, Class 0.2s). It can switch ON and OFF a 230 V AC - 8A load and reads the status of a 100-230
V AC input. It can be used for industrial process control and home automation, energy metering,
water treatment, agriculture irrigation and similar applications. Input can be used as a pulse
counter.
