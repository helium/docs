MCF-LW12TERPM LoRaWAN Outdoor Environmental Sensor PM1 PM2.5 PM10

The MCF-LW12TERPM is a solar-powered outdoor environmental sensor that reads the temperature,
relative humidity, barometric pressure and PM (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) and sends collected data over the
LoRaWAN network. Ideally suited for a wide range of applications such as weather stations, urban
monitoring, air quality, industrial, environmental or farming projects.
