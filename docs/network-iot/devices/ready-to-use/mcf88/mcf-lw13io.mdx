MCF-LW13IO LoRaWAN Wireless Actuator

The MCF-LW13IO is a wireless actuator that can switch ON and OFF a 230 V AC - 8A load and reads the
status of a 100-230 V AC input. The device can transmit the status of its input and control the
output through the LoRaWAN network. The device can be used for industrial process control and home
automation, water treatment and similar applications. Input can be used as a pulse counter.
