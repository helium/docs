## Milesight EM500-CO2 Carbon Dioxide Sensor (4 in 1)

EM500-CO2 Carbon Dioxide Sensor (4 in 1)

The EM500-CO2 is designed for measuring CO2, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure in harsh
environments and transmitting data by using LoRaWAN technology. With this low-power consumption
technology, the EM500-CO2 can work for up to 10 years with a 19000 mAh battery. The EM500-CO2 is
widely used for applications like greenhouse, building ventilation, fruit and vegetable storage,
