## Milesight EM500-UDL Ultrasonic Distance/Level Sensor

EM500-UDL Ultrasonic Distance/Level Sensor

The EM500-UDL is designed for object distance or level detection in harsh environments and for
transmitting data using LoRaWAN technology. With this low-power consumption technology, the
EM500-UDL can work for up to 10 years with a 19000 mAh battery. The EM500-UDL is widely used for
outdoor applications like snow level detection, flood monitoring, wastewater management, granary
level monitoring, etc. The measurement is based on ultrasonic waves transmitted and reflected from
nearby objects.
