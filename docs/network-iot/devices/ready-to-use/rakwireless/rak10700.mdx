## Overview

The RAK10700 WisBlock GNSS Tracker for LoRaWAN is an LPWAN Tracker device with a GNSS modem. It is
built with the WisBlock modules providing LPWAN and BLE communication using the nRF52 MCU and SX1262
LoRa transceiver of the RAK4631 Core module. It includes the RAK12500 GNSS location module with the
u-blox ZOE-M8Q chip, the RAK1906 environment sensor with the Bosch BME680 sensor, and the RAK1904
with an ST LIS3DH 3-axis acceleration sensor.

It is a feature-packed tracker device for featured applications development. It can also be used as
a quick prototyping tool for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and LoRaWAN Integration. Moreover, this LPWAN
Tracker is perfect for IoT applications such as asset tracking, smart vehicle management, and
location-based services.

### Product Features

## Connecting to Helium (The People's Network)

:::tip Before going through each and every step in Connecting the RAK10700 to Helium, it is
recommended to check first our
[Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK10700/Quickstart/).
:::

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network, with more than 400,000
hotspots deployed globally at the beginning of 2021. All the RAKwireless node products are
compatible with it, and the process of adding a device to the network is intuitive and
straightforward.

This guide focuses on connecting the GNSS Tracker to the network console, assuming that there is a
Helium Hotspot within range.

Log in or create your account [here](https://www.helium.com/console).

<img

/>

Once registered/logged in, you will end up at the home page, where you can see your function tree on
the left and DC balance at the top, as well as a number of useful links.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/2.home.png')} />

Go to the **Devices** section in the function tree. There will be no registered devices if this is
your first time doing this. To add a device, click the **+ Add Device** button and get started.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/3.device-section.png')}
/>

A window will pop up with a set of fields containing the device parameters required for its
registration.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/4.add-device.png')}
/>

Fill in a name of your choosing. The **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** will have random
values generated for you by default. Press the eye icon to reveal the values. You can manually
replace them with values of your own. For this tutorial, default values are used. Press the
**Submit** button, and you are done.

    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/5.registered-device.png',
  )}
/>

To check the decoded values in the Helium Console, you need to create a **Flow** that decodes the
data.

- First, go to **Functions** in the Helium Console and create a new function. For the name, you can
  choose anything. The function type needs to be **Decoder**. For the format, choose **Cayenne
  LPP**.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/5a-add-function.png')}
/>

- Next, go to **Flows** in the Helium Console and create a new flow. Connect your device to the flow
  that you just created.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/5b-add-flow.png')}
/>

Now, your RAK10700 is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen, import the **Dev
EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** in the RAK10700 using the
[RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Then start importing your
settings.

Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the EU868 band and OTAA
(the only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (the default one does not need
configuring).

The different regions are selected by number:

- 0: AS923
- 1: AU915
- 2: CN470
- 3: CN779
- 4: EU433
- 5: EU868
- 6: KR920
- 7: IN865
- 8: US915
- 9: AS923-2
- 10: AS923-3
- 11: AS923-4
- 12: RU864

:::

- Regional band and activation mode setting

```
AT+NJM=1
```

```
AT+BAND=10
```

- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:

```
AT+DEVEUI=XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

Update the APPEUI value of your LPWAN tracker by replacing the XXXX with the APPEUI value you get
from the Helium Console

```
AT+APPEUI=XXXX
```

- Enter App Key

You also need to update the APPKEY by getting the 16-byte APPKEY from the Helium Console:

```
AT+APPKEY=XXXX
```

- Join Network

Finish executing the join command for the node to initiate the join procedure.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:8:30
```

Once the procedure is initiated and completed, you will have a notification in the serial console.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak10700/6.successful-join.png',
  )}
/>

If you take a look at the Helium console, you will also see the join request packets both in the
graph and event log. Your node is now a part of the Helium Network.

If your GNSS Tracker can get a location fix, you can see the live data in the Helium Console Debug
window.
