## WisNode TrackIt Helium Integration

:::tip

Before going through each and every step in connecting RAK2171 to Helium, it is recommended to check
first the
[Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK2171/Quickstart/).

:::

This guide shows how to register the TrackIt device in the Helium console and make integration to
Datacake, where you can use the dashboard to view the data in a more user-friendly way.

Before you dive into registering the device in the Helium console and creating the Datacake
integration, you need to set the device to work in
[Third-Party LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) Mode](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK2171/Quickstart/#third-party-lorawan-network-server-lns-mode).

### Register the TrackIt Node in the Helium Console

1. Login to your Helium console account. If you do not have one, head to the web page and create
   one. Once you are logged in, you will see the Welcome window.

<img

/>

2. In the menu on the left side of the console, select **Devices** and click the **Add new device**
   button to register your device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/2.console-devices-page.png',
  )}
/>

3. In the **Name** field, type the preferred name of your device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/3.add-device.png')}
/>

4. You can see that the Helium console generates random **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key**.
   Since the TrackIt keys cannot be changed, you need to type your keys in the fields. These keys
   are found in the TrackIt application in the LoRaWAN Working Mode (Third Party NS).

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/4.trackit-keys.png')}
/>

5. Optionally, you can select a **Profile** and **Attach a Label**. For this tutorial, they will be
   skipped. Note that **Profiles** and **Labels** can be added after the device is registered.

6. After typing in the required keys, click **Save Device**, and you will see the registered device.
   As mentioned by the console, the initial join process takes about 20 minutes for the device to
   join, so be patient.

### Create Datacake Integration

1. While the device is joining, you can create the integration. Select **Integrations** from the
   menu in the left panel.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/5.integration-page.png',
  )}
/>

2. To create an integration, click on the **Add New Integration** button. A list of the available
   integrations will appear. As for this guide, click **Datacake**. For further information, refer
   to the [**Integrations** documentation](/console/integrations/).

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/6.available-integrations.png',
  )}
/>

3. On the next page, you will need a **Datacake Token**. To generate one, you will need a Datacake
   account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one on
   [Datacake's website](https://datacake.co/).

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/7.endpoint-token.png')}
/>

4. After logging in to your Datacake account, click your profile and select **Edit Profile**.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/8.datacake-console.png',
  )}
/>

5. In the **API** tab, you will find your API token. Copy and paste it into the **Enter Datacake
   Token** field in the Helium console.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/9.endpoint.png')} />

6. When you place the token, type a name of your choice for the integration and click **Add
   Integration** to continue.

#### Connection Between Helium and Datacake

1. Now that the device is registered and the integration is created, you will need to make a
   connection between Helium and Datacake. Click **Flows** on the left menu.

  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/11.console-flows.png')}
/>

2. Click the **+** icon in the **Nodes** area. A window will pop up with four menus – **Labels**,
   **Devices**, **Functions**, and **Integrations**. Click **Devices**, and you will see your
   registered device.

/>

5. On the next page, type the **Dev EUI** and the **Name of your device**. You can add more than one
   device. You can also drag and drop a `.csv` file, and it automatically adds multiple devices at
   once. Then click **Next**.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/19.add-device.png')}
/>

6. Finally, choose a plan. For this example, choose the **Free** one. Click **Add 1 device** to
   finish.

<img

/>

7. Now, your device is registered in Datacake.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/21.registered-device.png',
  )}
/>

8. You can click the name of your device and check the Dashboard.

<img
