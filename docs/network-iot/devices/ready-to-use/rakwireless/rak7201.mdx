## Connecting to Helium (The People's Network)

:::tip

Before going through each and every step in connecting the RAK7201 to Helium, it is recommended to
check first our
[Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK7201/Quickstart/).

:::

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network with more than 27,000 devices
deployed globally. All the RAKwireless node products are compatible with it and the process of
adding a device to the network is intuitive and straightforward. This section will focus on giving a
brief guide on how to connect the RAK7201 to the network console, assuming that there is a Helium
Hotspot within range.

Log in or create your account [here](https://www.helium.com/console).

<img

/>

Once registered/logged in, you will end up at the home page, where you can see your function tree on
the left and DC balance at the top, as well as a number of useful links.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7201/2.Console-Home-Screen.png',
  )}
/>

Go to the **Devices** section in the function tree. There will be no registered devices if this is
your first time doing this. To add a device, click the **+ Add Device** button and get started.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7201/3.Helium-Devices.png')}
/>

A window will pop up with a set of fields containing the device parameters required for its
registration.

ill in a name of your choosing. The **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** will have random
values generated for you by default. Press the eye icon to reveal the values. You can manually
replace them with values of your own. For this tutorial, default values are used. Press the
**Submit** button, and you are done.

/>

Now, your RAK7201 is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen, import the **Dev
EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** in the RAK7201 using the
[RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Hold the button 1 for 3
seconds to enter configuration mode, and then start importing your settings.

Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the EU868 band and OTAA
(the only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (the default one does not need
configuring).

- Regional band, device class, and activation mode setting

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

The same as with the Device EUI, replace the XXXX with your value:

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter App Key

Finally, fill in the App key with the command:

```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:XXXX
```

- Join Network

Finish executing the join command for the node to initiate the join procedure. Once the procedure is
initiated and completed, you will have a notification in the serial console.

```
at+join
```

Your output should resemble the one in figure below:

If you take a look at the Helium console, you will also see the join request packets both in the
graph and event log. Your node is now a part of the Helium Network.
