## Overview

RAK7431 WisNode Bridge Serial is an RS485 to LoRaWAN converter designed for industrial applications.
The device relays ModBUS data using the LoRaWAN network as means of wirelessly transmitting to and
from the end-devices.

RAK7431 can operate in all of the LoRaWAN bands within the standard parameters defined by the LoRa
Alliance. Its open environment range is 15+ km, and in industrial cases, where there are heavy
obstructions in the path of the RF signal performance is improved compared to conventional wireless
systems due to the characteristics of LoRa as a modulation technique. This allows for consistently
good signal quality within the confines of large factories, densely populated offices, storehouses,
etc.

This RS485 compatible device can address up to 16 client terminal nodes. The conversion from and to
LoRa frames is seamless and allows for real-time control and monitoring of multiple RS485 devices,
and bus data to access and control the RS485 terminal nodes.

RAK7431 together with RAK gateway and LoRa Server products, can easily and quickly build a wireless
industrial field control system. It adopts industrial protection design, supports a wide range
voltage supply, supports wall mounting and DIN rail installation, and facilitates field installation
and use.

## Connecting to Helium (The People's Network)

:::tip

Before going through each and every step in connecting the RAK7431 to Helium, it is recommended to
check first our
[Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/rak7431/Quickstart/).

:::

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network with more than 27,000 devices
deployed globally. All the RAKwireless node products are compatible with it and the process of
adding a device to the network is intuitive and straightforward.

This section will focus on giving a brief guide on how to connect the RAK7431 to the network
console, assuming that there is a Helium Hotspot within range.

Log in or create your account [here](https://www.helium.com/console).

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7431/1.helium-console.png')}
/>

Once registered/logged in, you will end up at the home page, where you can see your function tree on
the left and DC balance at the top, as well as a number of useful links.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7431/2.home.png')} />

Go to the **Devices** section in the function tree. There will be no registered devices if this is
your first time doing this. To add a device, click the **+ Add Device** button and get started.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7431/3.device-section.png')}
/>

A window will pop up with a set of fields containing the device parameters required for its
registration.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7431/4.add-device.png')}
/>

Fill in a name of your choosing. The **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** will have random
values generated for you by default. Press the eye icon to reveal the values. You can manually
replace them with values of your own. For this tutorial, default values are used. Press the
**Submit** button, and you are done.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/network-iot/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7431/5.registered-device.png',
  )}
/>

Now, your RAK7431 is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen, import the **Dev
EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** in the RAK7431 using the
[RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Then start importing your
settings.

Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the EU868 band and OTAA
(the only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (the default one does not need
configuring).

- Regional band, device class, and activation mode setting

```
at+joinmode=OTAA
```

```
at+region=EU868
```

- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:

```
at+deveui=XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

The same as with the Device EUI, replace the XXXX with your value:

```
at+appeui=XXXX
```

- Enter App Key

Finally, fill in the App key with the command:

```
at+appkey=XXXX
```

- Join Network

Run the following AT command for the node to join the network. Once the procedure is initiated and
completed, you will have a notification in the serial console.

```
at+restart
```

Your output should resemble the one in figure below:

If you take a look at the Helium console, you will also see the join request packets both in the
graph and event log. Your node is now a part of the Helium Network.
