<br />

This guide walks through the process of onboarding a data-only Hotspot to the Helium Network. The
onboarding procedure expects a gateway configured with the Semtech Packet Forwarder and Helium
Gateway-rs.

## Prerequisites

- LoRaWAN Gateway with Gateway-rs installed.
- Helium Wallet CLI with a funded account imported.
- Token balances to onboard data-only Hotspot.
  - 1,500,000 Data Credits (DCs)
    - 1,000,000 ($10) Data-Only Onboard
    - 500,000 ($5) Location Assert
  - SOL (Solana's native cryptocurrency) to cover transaction fees (~0.1 Sol)

## Installing Gateway-rs

If the gateway is already configured with gateway-rs, skip to
[Prepare the Helium Wallet CLI](#prepare-the-helium-wallet-cli).

If the gateway does not already have gateway-rs installed, follow these steps to install and
configure it.  
For more in-depth guides, refer to the available tutorials.

### Running From a Release

Compiled releases are available directly from GitHub.

- https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases

### Building From Source

Build the program from source. The build chain for gateway-rs is
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```sh title="Install Rust"
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

```sh title="Add Rust to shell"
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

```sh title="Install protobuf compiler"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```

```sh title="Clone the gateway-rs repository"
git clone https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs.git
```

```sh title="Build gateway-rs from within the gateway-rs directory"
cd gateway-rs/
cargo build --release
```

The compiled `helium_gateway` program will be available in the `gateway-rs/target/release/`
directory.

## Prepare Gateway-rs

To simplify running the `helium_gateway` program, place it in a folder that is easily accessible or
in the `/usr/bin/` directory. Placing `helium_gateway` in this bin directory will automatically add
it to the shell path.

```sh title="Copying the helium_gateway program to /usr/bin/"
sudo cp gateway-rs/target/release/helium_gateway /usr/bin/
```

```sh title="Running the helium_gateway program after adding it to /usr/bin/"
$ helium_gateway --version
> helium_gateway 1.1.1
```

### Configure `settings.toml`

From the downloaded release or built source, copy the settings.toml file into a directory where it
will not be overwritten and can be easily found.

The default path is `/etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml`. If using a different path, pass the
location of the settings.toml file to helium_gateway using the `-c` flag.

```sh title="Initialize the default directory for Helium Gateway"
sudo mkdir /etc/helium_gateway
```

```sh title="Make a copy of settings.toml in the default directory"
sudo cp gateway-rs/config/settings.toml /etc/helium_gateway/
```

For the subsequent steps, a command-line-based text editor is used.

```sh title="Edit the copied settings.toml file"
sudo nano /etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml
```

#### [Optional] Region Plan

Setting the gateway's region is only required if the Hotspot is not added and asserted to the
blockchain. For onboarded Hotspots, the region is retrieved via the asserted location stored
on-chain. The Hotspot will not transfer data unless one of these criteria is met.

```toml title="Uncomment this line by removing the #. Set the appropriate region"
# region = "US915"
```

To determine the region plan that should be used, refer to the
[Helium Region Plans](/iot/lorawan-region-plans) section. The selected region plan must match the
region plan in the Semtech Packet Forwarder.

#### [Optional] Define `gateway_key.bin` Location

The default path is `/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin`. If using a different path, update the key
location in `settings.toml`.

The `gateway_key.bin` file stores the information used to identify the Hotspot on the network. The
key file will allow gateway-rs to securely sign all messages transferred from the Hotspot. Key
signing allows the Helium Network to confirm that data payloads are delivered from verifiable
sources. The gateway_key will be generated during the first run of the server if no existing key is
found.

```toml
# File based:
keypair = "/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin"
```

It's advised to backup the `gateway_key.bin` file, especially if it needs to be recovered after the
onboarding process.

### First Run

With gateway-rs installed on the gateway, initialize the key for the Hotspot. If creating the
gateway_key in /etc/helium_gateway/, `sudo` may be required on first run to create the key file.

```sh title="Generate a swarm_key by running gateway-rs."
sudo helium_gateway server
```

    className="add-shadow add-shadow-margin add-border-radius"
    style={{ maxHeight: '200px' }}
  />
  <figcaption>Example successful result after first running Gateway-rs</figcaption>
</figure>

### Continued Operation

Gateway-rs will not automatically run at system start. To make gateway-rs automatically run, create
a system service.

```sh title="Create a service file for gateway-rs"
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service
```

Define the system user to execute the service (Line 9).

```service {9} showLineNumbers title="Create this service at /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service"
# /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service
[Unit]
Description=Helium Gateway

[Service]
ExecStart=helium_gateway server
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=15
User=<fill in current user>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once the service is written, activate it using the following commands.

```sh title="Activate the service"
sudo systemctl enable gateway-rs.service
```

```sh title="Start the service"
sudo systemctl start gateway-rs.service
```

```sh title="View logs for gateway-rs"
sudo journalctl -fu gateway-rs
```

If there are errors in the service, edit it by first stopping the service
(`systemctl stop gateway-rs.service`), then editing it
(`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service`). After changes are made, rerun the above
commands to test and monitor.

## Prepare the Helium Wallet CLI

The Helium Wallet CLI will be used to sign and submit the transaction generated. The Helium Wallet
CLI should not be installed on the Hotspot.

For details on setting up the Helium Wallet CLI and using an existing account, see the
[CLI Wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet) documentation.

```sh title="Get Helium address for the imported account"
./helium-wallet -f <path/to/>wallet.key info
```

The `info` command will return the wallet addresses for both the Solana blockchain and the legacy
Helium L1.

```json
{
  "address": {
    "helium": "<Helium Address>",
    "solana": "<Solana Address>"
  },
  "pwhash": "Argon2id13",
  "sharded": false
}
```

## Generate the `add` Transaction Using Gateway-rs

Connect to the Hotspot using SSH or the interface provided by the hardware manufacturer.

Gateway-rs provides tooling to generate a transaction using the gateway_key. Use the Solana address
for the `<OWNER>` and `<PAYER>` fields.

```sh title="Generate an Add Hotspot Transaction"
helium_gateway add --owner <OWNER> --payer <PAYER>
```

The owner and payer accounts can both be the same. To onboard the Hotspot, the payer account will
need to sign the transaction and pay the DC onboarding fee. The owner will be the recipient of the
Hotspot.

The add command will generate the transaction that can be used in the onboarding step.

```json {6} title="Add transaction result"
{
  "address": "<Hotspot Address>",
  "mode": "dataonly",
  "owner": "<Owner>",
  "payer": "<Payer>",
  "txn": "<Add Hotspot Transaction>"
}
```

## Onboarding With The Command Line Interface Wallet

Onboarding is done using the [Helium CLI Wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet).

The Helium CLI Wallet will not automatically convert HNT to Data Credits. Make sure the paying
account has at least 1,000,000 Data Credits available to complete the add transaction. The
transactions take place on the Solana blockchain, so a small amount of SOL is also required to cover
Solana fees.

```sh
helium-wallet hotspots add iot <Txn from gateway-rs> --commit
```

The CLI will return a Solana transaction hash for the on-chain event. This transaction can be looked
up using a Solana block explorer such as [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/) or
[Solscan](https://solscan.io/).

```json
{
  "result": "ok",
  "txid": "<Transaction ID>"
}
```

## Asserting Hotspot Location

Asserting the location of the Hotspot can be performed with either the Helium Wallet App or the
Helium CLI Wallet. Once onboarded to the network, asserting the location of a data-only Hotspot is
the same experience as any other Hotspot.

### Asserting Using the Helium Wallet App

Once the Hotspot has been onboarded, it will be visible in the wallet for the account indicated with
`--owner` in the previous `helium_gateway add` transaction. Follow the in-app steps to assert the
location of the Hotspot.

### Asserting Using the Helium CLI Wallet

To assert the location of the Hotspot using the Helium CLI Wallet, use the command
`helium-wallet hotspots assert`.

Make sure the paying account has at least 500,000 Data Credits available to complete the assert
transaction. The transactions take place on the Solana blockchain, so a small amount of SOL is also
required to cover Solana fees.

Before running the assert command, get the public key from the data-only Hotspot.

```sh
helium_gateway key info
```

The `key info` command will return the Hotspot's 'animal name' along with the Hotspot's public key.

```json
{
  "name": "angry-purple-tiger",
  "key": "11TL62V8NYvSTXmV5CZCjaucskvNR1Fdar1Pg4Hzmzk5tk2JBac",
  "onboarding": "11TL62V8NYvSTXmV5CZCjaucskvNR1Fdar1Pg4Hzmzk5tk2JBac"
}
```

Use the "key" value along with the Hotspot's physical latitude and longitude to assert its location
to the network. A utility such as [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net) is helpful for looking up
coordinates. Gain is set in dBm and elevation is set in meters.

```
helium-wallet hotspots assert iot <Hotspot Public Key> --lat=37.771150 --lon=-122.419200 --gain 1.2 --elevation 7 --commit
```

`--elevation` and `--gain` are optional values and can be updated at any time without further fees
as long as the lat/lon values remain the same. Use the built-in help command,
`helium-wallet hotspots assert --help` for more info.
