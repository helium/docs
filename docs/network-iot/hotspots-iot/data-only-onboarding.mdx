# Data-Only Hotspot Onboarding

This guide walks through the process of setting up and onboarding a data-only Hotspot to the Helium
Network. By the end of this guide, you will have:

- Assembled hardware
- Installed gateway-rs
- Created a CLI wallet
  - used that wallet to onboard Data-Only Hotspot.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi running 32-bit Raspbian OS
- Lora piHAT
- Lora Concentrator
- LoRa Antenna
- Internet Connection
- A second computer is recommended to ssh into the Data-Only Hotspot. This guide uses an M1 MacBook
  running macOS.

### Software

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) v1.71.0 or later
- SSH access to the Raspberry Pi

## Software Setup

### On The Data-Only Hotspot

1. Install Raspbian OS by following the instructions on the
   [Raspberry Pi installation guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
1. Connect the Hotspot to power and connect to the internet.

### From Another Computer

These steps are run via an ssh connection to the Hotspot from another device. This will install
gateway-rs on the Hotspot, not the second machine.

1. open a terminal window and ssh into the Hotspot.
2. install Rust following
   [this guide on the Official Rust Documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
3. verify rust is installed correctly

```sh title="Verify Rust installation"
❯ rustc --version
rustc 1.71.0 (8ede3aae2 2023-07-12)
❯ cargo --version
cargo 1.71.0 (cfd3bbd8f 2023-06-08)
```

4. clone the `gateway-rs` repo onto the Hotspot

```sh title="clone Repo"
❯ git clone git@github.com:helium/gateway-rs.git
```

5. navigate into the `gateway-rs` directory

```sh title="move into the directory"
❯ cd gateway-rs/
```

6. build gateway-rs specifying the `release` flag with the `--release` option

```sh title="create a release build"
❯ cargo build --release
```

:::tip multitasking

Building `gateway-rs` on a Raspberry Pi may take a while. Now is a good time to create a CLI wallet
if you have not done so already.

:::

### Verify The Installation

<!-- TODO: What do on Hotspot at this stage? -->

- once installed and built on the raspberry-pi
- verify gateway-rs runs
- when started, generates swam key for hotspot, typically want to back this up
  - will have to re-onboard if this is lost

<!-- TODO: standard user would use a `release` that avoids some of these build steps. -->

## Onboarding With The Command Line Wallet

Create a Command Line Wallet ("CLI Wallet" or "Wallet") on a trusted device, it is possible, **but
not recommended** to create the Wallet on the Hotspot itself.

### General Workflow:

1. Create a CLI Wallet
2. Fund that Wallet with HNT and SOL
3. Burn HNT to mint the required Data Credits for onboarding
4. Onboard the Data-Only Hotspot

:::warning CLI Wallet Work in Progress

This guide will work on Solana devnet but not Solana Mainnet.

The current cli-wallet does not support Solana transactions. This guide uses a special branch
created by MadNinja from Nova Labs that has not yet been merged for release.

:::

### Installing the CLI Wallet

1. Clone the `helium-wallet-rs` project from the
   [GitHub repo](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs)

```sh title="clone the repo"
❯ git clone git@github.com:helium/helium-wallet-rs.git
```

2. checkout the `madninja/solana` branch

```sh title="switch branch"
❯ git checkout madninja/solana
```

3. Create A Release Build

```sh
❯ cargo build --release
```

:::info 'Could not find protoc' error on macOS

If this error causes a a build to fail, install `proto-lense` following
[these steps](https://google.github.io/proto-lens/installing-protoc.html)

```sh title="macOS proto-lens installation with homebrew"
❯ brew install protobuf
```

Once installed, run the build command again.

:::

### Create A Basic Wallet

Now that the ClI Wallet is installed, create a Basic Wallet with the following command. Other
wallets can be created, this guide creates a Basic Wallet for simplicity.

When prompted, give the Wallet a password. This is **NOT** a seed phrase, but a password to access
the Wallet.

```sh title="create a basic wallet"
❯ ./target/release/helium-wallet create basic
Wallet Password: [hidden]
{
  "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
  "pwhash": "Argon2id13",
  "sharded": false
}
```

### Some Helpful Commands

```sh title="Print the Wallet QR code to the console"
❯ ./target/release/helium-wallet info --qr
```

```sh title="Print the Wallet Seed Phrase to the console"
❯ ./target/release/helium-wallet export --output seed
```

```sh title="List a Wallet's Hotspots"
❯ ./target/release/helium-wallet hotspots list
{
  "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
  "hotspots": []
}
```

```sh title="List a Wallet's Token Balances"
❯ ./target/release/helium-wallet balance
{
  "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
  "balance": {
    "hnt": {
      "address": "GKkG7EsWu4Va6BgYM63FaZurVGkBqCuh8bM7sHTKmZXN",
      "amount": 15.0
    },
    "sol": {
      "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
      "amount": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

## Onboard On Solana Devnet

This guide uses the Solana Devnet, and will include the `--url d` flag in commands to specify
Devnet.

Your wallet will need Devnet HNT and Devnet SOL. Which can be acquired here:

- Devnet HNT can be acquired by opening the following URL in any web browser.

  - 'https://faucet.web.test-helium.com/hnt/WALLET_ADDRESS?amount=5'
  - note there is a limit of 10 per load
  - the HNT Devne Faucet is rate limited, but please, dont be greedy.

- will also need devnet SOL for transaction fees.

  - [https://solfaucet.com](https://solfaucet.com) is a good option.

## Burn HNT for DC

This example command will burn 10 HNT for Data Credits.

**Note:** Without including the `--commit` flag at the end of the command, the on-chain transaction
will not be processed. This is an extra step to prevent accidental transactions and is ideal for
testing.

```sh title="HNT burn command"
❯ ./target/release/helium-wallet --url d dc mint --hnt 10`
```
