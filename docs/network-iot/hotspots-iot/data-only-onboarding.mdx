# Data-Only Hotspot Onboarding

This guide walks through the process of onboarding a data-only Hotspot to the Helium Network. The
onboarding procedure expects a gateway configured with the Semtech Packet Forwarder and Helium
Gateway-rs.

## Prerequsites

- LoRaWAN Gateway with Gateway-rs installed.
- Helium Wallet CLI with a funded account imported.
- Token balanced to onboard data-only Hotspot.
  - 1,500,000 Data Credits
    - 1,000,000 ($10) Data-Only Onboard
    - 500,000 ($5) Location Assert
  - SOL to cover transaction fees (~0.1 Sol)

## Prepare the Helium Wallet CLI

The Wallet CLI will be used to sign and submit the transaction generated. The Wallet CLI should not
be installed on the Hotspot.

The gateway-rs program will use the legacy Helium L1 account address to generate the `add`
transaction.

```sh title="Get Helium address for the imported account"
./helium-wallet -f <path/to/>wallet.key info
```

The `info` command will return the wallet addresses for both the Solana blockchain and the legacy
Helium L1.

```json
{
  "address": {
    "helium": "<Helium Address>",
    "solana": "<Solana Address>"
  },
  "pwhash": "Argon2id13",
  "sharded": false
}
```

## Generate a Transaction Using gateway-rs

Connect to the Hotspot using SSH or the interface provided by the hardware manufacturer.

Gateway-rs provides tooling to generate a transaction using the gateway_key. Use the Helium address
for the `<OWNER>` and `<PAYER>` fields.

```sh title="Generate an Add Hotspot Transaction"
./helium_gateway -c <path/to/>settings.toml add --owner <OWNER> --payer <PAYER>
```

The owner and payer accounts can both be the same. To onboard the Hotspot, the payer account will
need to sign the transaction and pay the DC onboarding fee. The owner will be the recipient of the
data-only Hotspot.

The add command will generate a txn that can be used in the next step.

```json {7} title="Add transaction result"
{
  "address": "<Hotspot Address>",
  "mode": "dataonly",
  "owner": "<Owner>",
  "payer": "<Payer>",
  "staking fee": 1000000,
  "txn": "<Add Transaction>"
}
```

## Onboarding With The Command Line Wallet

```
./helium-wallet hotspots add --subdao iot --mode data-only <Txn from gateway-rs> --commit
```

```sh title="List a Wallet's Hotspots"
./helium-wallet hotspots list
{
  "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
  "hotspots": []
}
```

```sh title="List a Wallet's Token Balances"
./helium-wallet balance
{
  "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
  "balance": {
    "hnt": {
      "address": "GKkG7EsWu4Va6BgYM63FaZurVGkBqCuh8bM7sHTKmZXN",
      "amount": 15.0
    },
    "sol": {
      "address": "c6kJqVC3gAzojrhzh9t2b8eTUeBoe7zEWaaqdZghux7Z",
      "amount": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```
