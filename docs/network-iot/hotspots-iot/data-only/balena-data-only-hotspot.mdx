# Data-Only Hotspot Setup with balena + Raspberry Pi + RAK2287

A data-only Hotspot is a type of Hotspot that participates on the Helium Network by transferring
data from the end devices (LoRaWAN nodes). The data-only Hotspots are eligible for Network Data
Transfer Rewards but not Proof of Coverage Rewards.

This guide covers all the steps needed to set up a data-only Hotspot using a Raspberry Pi and a RAK
concentrator (RAK2287) and the Pi Hat running on balena. This configuration can be achieved by
installing the **_gatewayrs_** and **_packet forwarder_** services open sourced by
[Nebra](https://github.com/nebraltd) and using balenaOS and [balenaCloud](https://balena.io).

## Getting started

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 0/2/3/4 or balenaFin
- SD card in case of the Raspberry Pi
- [RAK 2287 LoRa concentrator SPI based](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2287-lpwan-gateway-concentrator-module)
  and [RAK2287 Pi Hat](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2287-pi-hat)

:::important

To use the concentrator module with a Raspberry Pi HAT, you must make sure to order the variation
with the SPI interface.

### Software

- [balena.io account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/)
- [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)

## Deploy the code

Running this data-only Hotspot with balena.io is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud
application. You can do it in just one click by using the button below:

[![](https://www.balena.io/deploy.png)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/mpous/helium-data-hotspot)

Follow the instructions, click `Add a Device` and flash an SD card with that balenaOS image
downloaded from balenaCloud. Enjoy the magic 🌟Over-The-Air🌟!

Find the [repository with the source code here](https://github.com/mpous/helium-data-hotspot) if you
would like to clone and deploy from your computer or you would like to contribute.

## Configure the device

### Device Variables

Once the device is online on balenaCloud and the services `packet-forwarder` and `gateway-rs` are
downloaded and installed, go to `Device Variables`.

- Create the variable for all the services `VARIANT` with your hardware definition. During the test
  is being used a Raspberry Pi 4 with RAK2287 LoRa concentrator and the `VARIANT` is defined
  `DIY-RAK2287`. This `VARIANT` is compatible with any Raspberry Pi. You can find here the
  [list of hardware compatible](https://github.com/NebraLtd/helium-hardware-definitions).

- Create the variable for all the services `REGION_OVERRIDE` with your LoRa region (e.g. `EU868`).
  You can find here the [list of LoRa regions compatible](https://github.com/NebraLtd/hm-pktfwd).

### Test the Helium Hotspot

Once the Device Variables are properly set up, the Hotspot should be running showing some errors on
connecting to the Blockchain on the balenaCloud Logs.

To check that the Hotspot has been generated correctly, go to the `Terminal` and select the
`gateway-rs` service, then introduce.

`helium_gateway key info`

And you will get something like this:

`{ "address": <hotspot address>, "name": <hotspot name> }`

At this point, your data-only Hotspot is ready to join the Helium blockchain!

### Join the Helium blockchain with your Hotspot

To join the Helium blockchain, at the moment (summer 2021) you only can use the Helium CLI. The
Helium app is still not compatible with the data-only hotspots. Follow
[this instructions](https://github.com/mpous/helium-data-hotspot/#join-the-helium-blockchain-with-your-data-only-hotspot)
to add your data-only Hotspot on the Blockchain.

You can find the instructions to do it
[here](https://github.com/mpous/helium-data-hotspot/#join-the-helium-blockchain-with-your-data-only-hotspot).

## Check your Data-Only Hotspot

Now that your data-only Hotspot has been added to the Blockchain you should be able to see it on
your Helium wallet.

If you create a Helium Device, then go to the [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and
Inspect packages from your device to confirm that the data-only Hotspot is the one that relays the
data from your Devices. You also will be able to see on the balenaCloud logs that UPLINK messages
have been relayed to the Helium OUI.

## Manage your gateway_key

It's extremely important that at this point, with the Hotspot added on the Helium blockchain you
backup the `gateway_key`. If you lose this key, you will not be able to use this hotspot anymore in
case there is a problem on your Hotspot (SD card corrupted, etc).

### Backup your gateway_key.bin file

Follow these instructions to back up your gateway_key.bin file of your Hotspot.

- Open an SSH session to the "host-os" on balenaCloud Terminal.
- Type this command and keep note of the (YOUR INSTANCE)\_miner-storage:
  `ls /var/lib/docker/volumes`
- Type this command to get a link to download the gateway key (note to replace the YOUR INSTANCE
  part with the container number that you got from the previous command)
  `curl -F "file=@/var/lib/docker/volumes/(YOUR INSTANCE)_miner-storage/_data#/gateway_key.bin" https://file.io`
- Use the outputted file.io link to securely download your swarm key. The link only works one time.

### Restore your gateway_key.bin file on your new file

Follow this instructions to restore your gateway_key.bin key into your new hotspot.

- Open an SSH session to the "host-os" on balenaCloud Terminal.
- Type this command and keep note of the (YOUR INSTANCE)\_miner-storage information:
  `ls /var/lib/docker/volumes`
- Navigate to where the swarm_key is stored
  `cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/(YOUR INSTANCE)_miner-storage/_data#/`
- Remove the original `gateway_key.bin` file `rm gateway_key.bin`
- Reboot miner and you will see it restored and working :)
- Upload your `gateway_key.bin` that you wish to restore onto file.io and do
  `curl -LJO [FILE.IO UPLOAD LINK]`
