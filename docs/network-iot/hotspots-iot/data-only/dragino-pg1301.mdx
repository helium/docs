# Data Only Hotspot Setup with Dragino PG1301 and Raspberry Pi

import LegacyContentBanner from '@site/src/theme/LegacyContentBanner'

<LegacyContentBanner />

A Data Only Hotspot is a type of Hotspot that participates on the Helium Network by transferring
data from the end devices (LoRaWAN nodes). The Data Only Hotspots are eligible for Network Data
Transfer Rewards but not Proof of Coverage Rewards.

This guide covers all the steps needed to set up a Data Only Hotspot using a Raspberry Pi and
Dragino PG1301 hat.

## Getting started

This process assumes you have some basic Linux skills, can use a text editor and understand what a
service is. You should be able to use programs like `scp` to move data between the Raspberry Pi and
other computers on your network.

What we will be doing is :

- installing the LoRa Packet Forwarder service from Dragino to use the Concentrator hat
- installing the Helium Gateway service to move data between the packet forwarder and the Helium
  network
- configure everything
- verify everything is working

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4. Other faimilies of Pi may work, but this has only been tested on the Pi 4 Model B.
- [Dragino 10 channels - LoRaWAN GPS Concentrator for Raspberry Pi](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/149-lora-gps-hat.html)

### Software

We will be using the following:

- Fresh Raspbian Buster image
- lorapktfwd package from
  [Dragino Downloads Site](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/index.php?dir=LoRa_Gateway/PG1301/software/)
- Latest helium-gateway package release from [Helium](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases)
  ending in -`-raspi234.deb`

## Configure the Raspberry Pi

1. Use the Raspberry Pi Configuration application and enable the SPI kernel module in the Interface
   Options section. This is located in the GUI from the Applications Menu under Preferences
2. Reboot to apply the changes

If you haven't done so, attach the Dragino PG1301 to the Raspberry Pi with the power off, attach the
antenna, then power on.

## Install the LoRa Packet Forwarder Service

1. Open the web browser and download `lorapktfwd_v1.1.deb` from the
   [Dragino Downloads Site](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/index.php?dir=LoRa_Gateway/PG1301/software/)
2. Open a terminal window and install the package using dpkg
   ```
   sudo dpkg -i lorapktfwd_v1.1.deb
   ```
3. Verify lorapktfwd is running using systemctl
   ```
   sudo systemctl status lorapktfwd
   ```

Example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Downloads

## Configure the LoRa Packet Forwarder

These steps assume the US915 region. For other regions, replace with your region locale
configuration in Step 2.

1. Change directory to the `/etc/lora-gateway` directory
   ```
   cd /etc/lora-gateway
   ```
2. Copy the US915 Band 2 configuration from the `cfg` subdirectory as global_conf.json
   ```
   cp cfg/dragino/global_conf.us915_1.json global_conf.json
   ```
3. Generate a unique gateway ID based on the MAC address of one of your network interface(s). Use
   the following bash syntax to help create one.
   ```
   echo `ip a | grep 'link/ether' | cut -d ' ' -f 6 | sed 's/://g'` | tr a-z A-Z
   ```
   This command will generate you one or more unique values you can use for the gateway EUI.

In the below example, you see two values (DCA6328XXX6F and DCA6328XXX70) because there is an active
wired and wireless interface on the Raspberry Pi. It doesn't matter which one you use, as all MAC
addresses are globally unique.

The goal here is to guarantee a unique gateway ID in the network.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/Downloads $ cd /etc/lora-gateway/
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/lora-gateway $ cp cfg/dragino/global_conf.us915_1.json global_conf.json
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/lora-gateway $ echo `ip a | grep 'link/ether' | cut -d ' ' -f 6 | sed 's/://g'` | tr a-z A-Z
DCA6328XXX6F DCA6328XXX70
pi@raspberrypi:/etc/lora-gateway $
```

In the next step we will be using the `DCA6328XXX70` value as an example. Do not use the example
value from this documentation, it will not work.

### Point the LoRa Packet Forwarder to the Helium Gateway

By default the LoRa Packet Forwarder from Dragino is configured to work with the Things Network.
Here we will configure it to talk to the Helium gateway you installed on the Raspberry Pi.

1. Use a text editor and open the `/etc/lora-gateway/local_conf.json` file
2. Replace the current value for gateway_ID with (one of) the values generated in the previous step
   and **append the value FFFF to the end**. The reason we append `FFFF` to the end is the gateway
   ID is required to be 16 characters, and the unique MAC address generated is only 12. Again, this
   guarantees your gateway ID will be unique in the network.
3. Add the `server_address` key with the value `127.0.0.1`
4. Add the `serv_port_up` key with the value `1680`
5. Add the `serv_port_down` key with the value `1680`

You should have something that resembles the following in your /etc/lora-gateway/local_conf.json
file. Be sure to double check the JSON syntax and have the key/values separated by commas and the {}
characters match up.

```
   {
     "gateway_conf": {
          "gateway_ID": "DCA6328XXX70FFFF",
          "server_address": "127.0.0.1",
          "serv_port_up": 1680,
          "serv_port_down": 1680
     }
   }
```

For reference, the server address being used is the local machine (127.0.0.1, also called localhost)
and port 1680 is the port the helium service is communicating on. **Don't** use the value assigned
by your router or the public IP address.

When you are finished make sure to save and exit the file.

### Configure the Helium Gateway Region

The default region of the _helium_gateway_ service is US915, so you can continue with the next
section if you are using this one. Otherwise, you must set your region frequency in
`/etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml`. Add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```
region = "<region>"
```

Possible values are:

```
US915 | EU868 | EU433 | CN470 | CN779 | AU915 | AS923_1 | AS923_2 | AS923_3 | AS923_4 | KR920 | IN865
```

For instance, if your region is EU868 the content in `settings.toml` must be.

```
region = "EU868"

[log]
method = "syslog"
level = "info"
timestamp = false

[update]
platform = "raspi234"
```

## Activate The Changes

Now, reboot the Raspberry Pi to restart the services and verify that everything starts at boot time
and is working.

## Post-Reboot Checks

- You can view the log file of the LoRa Packet Forwarder by opening a terminal window and running
  ```
  journalctl -u lorapktfwd
  ```
- You can view the log file of the Helium Gateway by opening another terminal window and running
  ```
  journalctl -u helium_gateway
  ```

Use the spacebar to scroll thru the logs, and Ctrl-C to get back to the command prompt.

Congradulations, your LoRa Packet Forwarder and Helium Gateway service is setup! At this point your
LoRa radio will be able to pass radio traffic between the network and the Helium gateway. Any
devices you registered via the Helium console should now be live. Your hotspot will not appear on
the map. Before adding your hotspot to the blockchain, please check and backup your configuration.

## Check and Backup your Configuration

1. To view your gateway address and unique animal name assigned to you
   ```
   helium_gateway key info
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   $ helium_gateway key info
   {
   "address": "13XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "name": "unique-animal-name"
   }
   ```
2. Backup your gateway key to another machine/media for recovery purposes. The file
   `/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin` contains the key.

:::warning

If you lose this key, you will not be able to use this hotspot anymore in case there is a problem on
your hostpot (SD card corrupted, etc). You will need to generate a new key and lose your existing
animal name/hostpot configuration

:::

## Testing the packet transfer with an end device

If you have an end device (LoRaWAN node), you can check if the hotspot can transfer packets through
the network. In other words, you can check if the devices can send data to the Helium Console. The
Helium Console is where you can provision and manage the end devices, so the nodes need to be
registered to start using the network.

## What's next?

At this point, after you verified your Data Only Hotspot is working, it is ready to be added to the
blockchain! You can find more information about that process [here](/iot/data-only-hotspots).
