This guide covers the steps needed to set up a data-only Hotspot using a WisLink RAK LPWAN
concentrator module and a Raspberry Pi.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi:** Multiple families are supported, however, not all the models have been tested.
  It's recommended to follow this guide with a Pi 3 or Pi 4.

- **LoRaWAN Concentrator:** The concentrator module and Pi HAT to interface it with the Raspberry
  Pi. The following table contains the links to concentrators and their HATs.

## Packet Forwarder Preparation

To prepare the hardware to become a Helium data-only Hotspot, it first must be configured to handle
LoRaWAN messages. To get started, install an operating system and set up the packet forwarder as
outlined in one of the two options below.

LoRaWAN gateways are generally 'headless' computers. The
[Raspberry Pi Headless](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-up-a-headless-raspberry-pi)
documentation is a helpful reference for initial setup.

#### Option 1

Follow this
[installation procedure](https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway#installation-procedure)
if you are already familiar with the Raspberry Pi and the RAK concentrator modules.

#### Option 2

Follow the Quick Start Guide for your concentrator on the
[RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/#wislink-lpwan).
If using WiFi for initial setup, it is recommended to initially configure the Raspberry Pi using
[Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaXWS8Lk34).

- [RAK2287 Quickstart](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2287/Quickstart/)
- [RAK2247 Quickstart](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2247/Quickstart/)
- [RAK2245 Quickstart](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Quickstart/)

### Select The Region Plan

Enter the gateway configuration interface by using the following command.

```
sudo gateway-config
```

Select the _Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan_ option, then _Server is TTN_, and in the last step
choose the proper plan according to your country. To finish, press OK.

<br />

### Verify If The Packet Forwarder Is Running

When the LoRa packet forwarder is running as a service, some log messages are recorded in the
syslog. To inspect the logs, run the following command:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep ttn-gateway
```

The log output should show something similar to:

```
rak-gateway ttn-gateway[1886]: JSON up: {"stat":{"time":"2021-07-21 16:25:00 GMT","rxnb":0,"rxok":0,"rxfw":0,"ackr":0.0,"dwnb":0,"txnb":0,"temp":0.0}}

```

:::note

`ttn-gateway` is just the name for the LoRa packet forwarder service in the configuration for these
RAK concentrators; this is a "legacy name" that doesnâ€™t change when using different network servers.

:::

### Edit The Packet Forwarder Settings

You will need to edit some basic options in the packet forwarder configuration to forward the
packets to the address and port the helium_gateway service is listening to.

Select the option _Edit packet-forwarder config_ within the _gateway-config_ interface. This option
will open the `global_conf.json` file using the nano editor. Then, set the _server_address_ to
127.0.0.1 and the _server ports_ to 1680, as follows:

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-packet-forwarder-settings.png')}
    style={{ maxHeight: '450px' }}
    className="add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />

Close the editor by pressing CTRL + X, press ENTER to save the file.

Restart the packet forwarder to apply the changes by selecting the option _Restart packet-forwarder_
within the _gateway-config_ interface.

:::important

Every time a new region is selected using the _Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan_ option, these
settings are replaced with the default configuration. Make sure to keep this in mind if the region
is changed later.

## Helium Gateway Service Installation

### Downloading The Package

Download the latest release from the [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) repository,
and set the `<version>` according to
[the latest release](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases). You can download it in any
directory, for example `/tmp`.

#### Option 1

Get from the repo directly to the Raspberry Pi by running the following commands.

```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases/download/<version>/helium-gateway-<version>-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz
```

Expand the archive.

```sh
tar -xf helium-gateway-<version>-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz
```

#### Option 2

You can also download it to your computer and pass it to the Raspberry Pi through the Secure Copy
Protocol (SCP).

```sh
scp helium-gateway-<version>-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz pi@<gateway ip>:/tmp/
```

Through an SSH connection, expand the archive.

```sh
tar -xf helium-gateway-<version>-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz
```

#### Option 3

Build the program from source. The build chain for gateway-rs is
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). While build times may be slower, gateway-rs can be
built directly on the Raspberry Pi.

```sh title="Install Rust"
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

```sh title="Add Rust to shell"
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

```sh title="Install protobuf compiler"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```

```sh title="Clone the gateway-rs repo"
git clone https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs.git
```

```sh title="Build gateway-rs"
cd gateway-rs/
cargo build --release
```

### Gateway Configuration

After obtaining or building gateway-rs, move the `helium_gateway` executable file and
`settings.toml` file to places where they are easily accessible.

#### Gateway Settings

The `settings.toml` file handles the location of the keyfile used to sign messages as well as the
default region configuration for the Helium Network. It is recommended to make a copy of the
settings.toml file that otherwise exists within the gateway-rs/config/ folder.

For simplicity in this guide, place the settings.toml file at the home path.

```sh title="Make a copy of settings.toml"
cp gateway-rs/config/settings.toml ~/settings.toml
```

Similarly, edit settings.toml to match the intended path for `gateway_key.bin`. The gateway_key.bin
file is created at the defined directory on the first run of the gateway-rs server.

```toml title="Update the keypair path in settings.toml"
...
# File based:
keypair = "<path/to/>gateway_key.bin"
...
```

#### Create a Service

Create a service to handle automatically starting gateway-rs.

Update the paths in `ExecStart` for both the location of the `helium_gateway` binary and the
`settings.toml` file (Line 6).  
Additionally, define the system user to execute the service (Line 9).

```service {6,9} showLineNumbers title="Create this service at /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service"
# /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service
[Unit]
Description=Helium Gateway

[Service]
ExecStart=</path/to/>helium_gateway -c </path/to/>settings.toml server
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=15
User=<fill in current user>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once the service is written and proper paths are set, activate it using the following commands.

```sh title="Activate the service"
sudo systemctl enable gateway-rs.service
```

```sh title="Start the service"
sudo systemctl start gateway-rs.service
```

```sh title="View logs for gateway-rs"
sudo journalctl -fu gateway-rs
```

If there are errors in running the service edit it by first stopping the service
(`systemctl stop gateway-rs.service`), then editing it
(`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gateway-rs.service`). After changes are made, rerun the above
commands to test and monitor.

### Region Configuration

The region configuration for gateway-rs is a default. The on-chain asserted location of the gateway
will override the definition in settings.toml. Updating the region in settings is optional as long
as the Hotspot location is asserted..

## Verifying The Installation

### Inspecting The Service Logs

The service starts after installation automatically. You can check the execution logs by running the
following command.

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep helium_gateway
```

### Getting Some Information About The Hotspot

Use the following command to get the public key address and animal name of your Hotspot.

```
./helium_gateway -c ~/settings.toml key info
```

This command should give you an output like the following one.

```json
{
  "address": <hotspot address>,
  "onboarding": <hotspot address>,
  "name": <hotspot name>
}
```

#### Backup The gateway_key

The `gateway_key.bin` file stores the information used to identify the Hotspot on the network. It's
highly advised to backup this file, especially if you need to recover it later after the onboarding
process.

Using SCP could be an option to do the backup; that would be something like this.

```
scp pi@<gateway ip>:/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin <destination directory>
```

If using Windows, a tool like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) will enable this
functionality.

## Onboard the Hotspot

Refer to the [Data-Only Onboarding Guide](/iot/data-only-hotspots-onboarding) to complete the
onboarding of the fully-configured Hotspot.
