# Data Only Hotspot Setup With Rakwireless Concentrator + Raspberry Pi

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

This guide covers all the steps needed to set up a data-only Hotspot using a WisLink RAK LPWAN
concentrator module and a Raspberry Pi. This configuration can be achieved by installing the
**_helium_gateway_** service available on the [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs)
repository.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi:** Multiple families are supported, however, not all the models have been tested.
  It's recommended to follow this guide with a Pi 3 or Pi 4.

- **LoRaWAN Concentrator:** The concentrator module and Pi HAT to interface it with the Raspberry
  Pi. The following table contains the links to concentrators and their HATs.

:::important

To use the concentrator module with a Raspberry Pi HAT, make sure to use a variation with SPI
interface.

## Packet Forwarder Preparation

To prepare the hardware to become a Helium data-only Hotspot, it first must be configured to handle
LoRaWAN messages. To get started, set up the packet forwarder as outlined in one of the two options
below.

#### Option 1

Follow this
[installation procedure](https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway#installation-procedure)
if you are already familiar with the Raspberry Pi and the RAK concentrator modules.

#### Option 2

Follow the Quick Start Guide for your concentrator on the
[RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/#wislink-lpwan).

- [RAK2287 Quickstart](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2287/Quickstart/)
- [RAK2247 Quickstart](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2247/Quickstart/)
- [RAK2245 Quickstart](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Quickstart/)

### Select The Region Plan

Enter the gateway configuration interface by using the following command.

```
sudo gateway-config
```

Select the _Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan_ option, then _Server is TTN_, and in the last step
choose the proper plan according to your country. For instance, the image shows the option to select
US915. To finish, press OK.

<img
  className="docsheader"
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-gateway-config-interface-region-plan.png',
  )}
/>

### Verify If The Packet Forwarder Is Running

When the LoRa packet forwarder is running as a service, some log messages are recorded in the
syslog. To inspect the logs, run the following command:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep ttn-gateway
```

The log output should show something similar to:

```
rak-gateway ttn-gateway[1886]: JSON up: {"stat":{"time":"2021-07-21 16:25:00 GMT","rxnb":0,"rxok":0,"rxfw":0,"ackr":0.0,"dwnb":0,"txnb":0,"temp":0.0}}

```

:::note

`ttn-gateway` is just the name for the LoRa packet forwarder service in the configuration for these
RAK concentrators; this is a "legacy name" that doesnâ€™t change when using different network servers.

:::

### Edit The Packet Forwarder Settings

You will need to edit some basic options in the packet forwarder configuration to forward the
packets to the address and port the helium_gateway service is listening to.

Select the option _Edit packet-forwarder config_ within the _gateway-config_ interface. This option
will open the `global_conf.json` file using the nano editor. Then, set the _server_address_ to
127.0.0.1 and the _server ports_ to 1680, as follows:

<img
  className="docsheader"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-packet-forwarder-settings.png')}
/>

Close the editor by pressing CTRL + X, press ENTER to save the file and restart the packet forwarder
to apply the changes by selecting the option _Restart packet-forwarder_ within the _gateway-config_
interface.

:::important

Every time a new region is selected using the _Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan_ option, these
settings are replaced with the default configuration. So, make sure to keep this in mind if you
modify the region later.

## Helium Gateway Service Installation

### Downloading The Package

Download the latest release from the [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) repository,
and set the `<version>` according to
[the latest release](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases). You can download it in any
directory, for example `/tmp`.

#### Option 1

Getting from the repo directly to the Raspberry Pi by running the following commands.

```
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases/download/<version>/helium-gateway-<version>-raspi234.deb
```

#### Option 2

You can also download it to your computer and pass it to the Raspberry Pi through the Secure Copy
Protocol (SCP).

```
scp helium-gateway-<version>-raspi234.deb pi@<gateway ip>:/tmp/
```

### Installing The Package

Run the following command in the same directory you downloaded the package to install the
_helium_gateway_ service in the operating system.

```
sudo dpkg -i helium-gateway-<version>-raspi234.deb
```

### Region Configuration

The default region of the _helium_gateway_ service is US915, so you can continue with the next
section if you are using this one. Otherwise, you must set your region frequency in
`/etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml`. Add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```
region = "<region>"
```

Possible values are:
`US915 | EU868 | EU433 | CN470 | CN779 | AU915 | AS923_1 | AS923_2 | AS923_3 | AS923_4 | KR920 | IN865`.

For instance, if your region is EU868 the content in `settings.toml` must be.

```
region = "EU868"

[log]
method = "syslog"
level = "info"
timestamp = false

[update]
platform = "raspi234"
```

After updating the value, you need to restart the _helium_gateway_ service to apply the changes.

```
sudo systemctl restart helium_gateway
```

## Verifying The Installation

### Inspecting The Service Logs

The service starts after installation automatically. You can check the execution logs by running the
following command.

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep helium_gateway
```

The first log messages should look like these ones.

```
rak-gateway helium_gateway[23658]: starting, module: gateway

```

Whenever you need to restart the service you can use the command below.

```
sudo systemctl restart helium_gateway
```

### Getting Some Information About The Hotspot

Use the following command to get the public key address and animal name of your Hotspot.

```
helium_gateway key info
```

This command should give you an output like the following one.

```
{
  "address": <hotspot address>,
  "name": <hotspot name>
}
```

#### Backup The gateway_key

The `gateway_key.bin` file located at /etc/helium_gateway stores the information used to identify
the Hotspot on the network. It's highly advised to backup this file, especially if you need to
recover it later after the onboarding process.

Using SCP could be an option to do the backup; that would be something like this.

```
scp pi@<gateway ip>:/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin <destination directory>
```

If you are using Windows, you can try a tool like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) too.

### Testing The Packet Transfer With An End Device

If you have an end device (LoRaWAN node), you can check if the Hotspot can transfer packets through
the network. In other words, you can check if the devices can send data to the Helium Console. The
Helium Console is where you can provision and manage the end devices, so the nodes need to be
registered to start using the network.

To register your end device on the console, you can follow the steps described on
[Adding Devices](/console/adding-devices/).

#### Inspecting the packet transfer behavior

Make sure your device is configured or flashed with the same keys you registered on the console.
Then, when your device is ready to transmit data, take a look at the log messages again.

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep helium_gateway
```

Power up or reset your device. Every time it tries to send a message, you should see the information
related to the packet received by the hotspot and where it is being routed.

```
rak-gateway helium_gateway[23658]: ignoring raw packet PushData(Packet { random_token: 18563, gateway_mac: MacAddress { bytes: [228, 95, 1, 255, 254, 3, 45, 43] }, data: Data { rxpk: Some([V1(RxPkV1 { chan: 4, codr: _4_5, data: [64, 11, 8, 0, 72, 0, 25, 1, 2, 138, 20, 173, 187, 16, 164, 246, 161, 241, 78, 16, 36, 238, 117, 161, 188, 240], datr: DataRate(SF7, BW125), freq: 904.7, lsnr: 13.2, modu: LORA, rfch: 1, rssi: -20, rssis: Some(-20), size: 26, stat: OK, tmst: 668364099 })]), stat: None } }), module: gateway
rak-gateway helium_gateway[23658]: routing packet to: http://54.193.165.228:8080/, module: router
```

If you can see this kind of log your hotspot is working like a charm!

Now, you should start to see some events on the console. Sometimes, it could take some minutes
before you start to see any activity; wait for a bit and reset your device if it's needed.

<img
  className="docsheader"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-console-events.png')}
/>

As a final check, you can compare if the Hotspot Name matches the one you obtained before. It could
be different if there are more hotspots providing coverage around you. In that case, you can explore
the _Multiple Packets_ configuration to purchase more packets when several hotspots hear the device.

## What's next?

At this point, your data-only Hotspot is ready to be added to the blockchain! You can find more
information about that process [here](/iot/data-only-hotspots#pre-requisites).
