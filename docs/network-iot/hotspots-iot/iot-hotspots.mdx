## IOT Hotspot Properties

The IOT Hotspot software [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) is in production,
satisfying the following properties:

- A Hotspot on the Helium network will Beacon automatically on a pre-determined time interval.
- A Hotspot will submit PoC receipts directly to an Off-Chain PoC Oracle.
- A Hotspot will transmit packets on behalf of IoT devices on the Network to an Off-Chain Data
  Oracle.
- A Hotspot will no longer depend on libp2p or "gossip", and instead use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), a
  new framework to communicate between distributed systems
- A Hotspot will be eligible to earn IOT token rewards.
- A Hotspot will reconnect every 30 minutes to
  [Packet Router Service](/oracles/data-transfer-oracles#packet-router-service) in order to ensure
  healthy connection and optimal load distribution.

:::info Naming

All IOT Hotspots are referred to as "Hotspots", discarding the previous distinctions of "Full
Hotspot" and "Light Hotspot."

With the switch to `gateway-rs,` all IOT Hotspots are "Light Hotspots", so the prefix is no longer
needed.

## HIP 70 Changes

[HIP-70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/471)has passed. HIP-70 proposes a new architecture
involving several Oracles, allowing Proof of Coverage ("PoC") generation to be automated and its
receipts to be off-chain.

The most taxing piece of PoC is not just Challenge creation but Receipt validation and verification.
By taking these tasks off-chain, PoC event frequency can increase to several times daily. As a
result, Hotspot operators can expect more reliable challenges and witness events.

## IOT Proof of Coverage Architecture Overview

1. A Hotspot broadcasts a Beacon.
2. Nearby Hotspot(s) witness the Beacon.
3. Witness Hotpot(s) submit a receipt to an Ingestor Oracle.
4. The Packet Verifier gets data from the Packet Router.
5. The Ingestor Oracle uploads the receipts to a cloud store.
6. A Verifier Oracle takes this input from the Ingestor Oracle and the Packet Verifier to filter out
   invalid receipts and produce a Reward output.
7. The Reward output passes to the Reward Oracle, determining how many reward shares a Hotspot
   should earn for the epoch.
8. Finally, the Injector Oracle distributes Hotspots rewards.

## Code and Development

The bulk of the code that enables Hotspots on actual LoRaWAN gateways is Helium's next-generation
packet forwarder called [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs).
