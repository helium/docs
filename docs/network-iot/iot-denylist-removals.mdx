# Denylist Removal Submissions

<LegacyContentBanner />

To submit a Hotspot for removal from the Denylist, start by logging in with your Helium Wallet and
clicking on the `Submit Denylist Request` button on the [Crowdspot.io](https://crowdspot.io/) home
page.

### Log In with the Helium Wallet App

To associate a Helium Wallet address, click the `Login` menu bar item on the
[Crowdspot homepage](https://crowdspot.io/) and scan the QR code with your phone's camera or QR code
scanner.

Once you have scanned the QR Code, the Helium Wallet app will open and prompt you to authenticate
Crowdspot.

1. **Confirm Connection Start**: Confirm that you _do_ want to connect a Helium Wallet to Crowdspot.
2. **Choose Wallet**: Choose the account you would like to use with Crowdspot, and tap Continue.
3. **Authenticate**: Send a transaction to the Helium blockchain to complete login.

If you are already logged in, you will see a Profile Badge and a portion of the connected wallet
address. The Profile badge will match in the Helium Wallet app and on Crowdspot.

Otherwise, if no account is logged in, no Profile Badge is visible, and the `Login` menu bar item is
shown.

## Submit a Removal Request

:::caution Security

For security reasons, text and visual evidence will only be accessible to Denylist maintainers.

Although you cannot view this evidence when you click on a submission, we assure you that it can be
seen and is being evaluated.

:::

In an ideal world, Legitimate Hotspots are appropriately screened and not added to the Denylist.
Still, when this _does_ happen, Hotspot Owners can submit information and evidence to _potentially_
have a Hotspot removed from the Denylist.

### Submission Type

On the Submission form, select the `Removal` radio button under Submission Type.

### Visual Evidence

Denylist Removal submissions can optionally include visual evidence, such as screenshots or other
images, to support the removal claim. **At this time, visual evidence can be submitted as a URL**
with a limit of 3 URLs per submission.

- For multiple images, we recommend using a cloud image storage platform, such as
  [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/). Upload your
  images and share a link to the folder here. **Please ensure you enable the correct sharing
  settings, as links will be publicly available.**
- For a single image, we recommend using a free image-to-link converter and paste the URL in the
  text box.

### Written Reasoning

Submitting a written description to support the Removal Request submission provides valuable insight
for evaluation. A minimum of 150 characters is required.

### Create the Submission

Once you have added all the required and optional information, click the `Create Submission` button.

Users can view submission’s ID number after they have successfully created a submission. This ID
number will appear in the submission's confirmation message (ex: Submission #1234). **Please note,
that this number ID will only appear one time upon submitting, so please save it for future
reference.**

You can view the status of your submission on the
[Submissions page](https://www.crowdspot.io/submissions/), linked in the
[Crowdspot](https://crowdspot.io/) menu bar.
