Like most blockchains, Helium has a system of transaction fees. All transactions in the Helium
blockchain are paid in Data Credits (DCs). Data Credits are produced via burning some amount of
`HNT` using an on-chain transaction. And thanks to a system called "Implicit Burn", users
(typically) don't need to manually supply `DCs` to pay fees. As long as the Helium wallet being used
to submit the transaction contains enough `HNT` to burn to `DCs` to fund the transaction, the burn
will happen implicitly, requiring no user intervention.

## Transaction Fee Schedule

The following is a list of the current set of fees required for various transactions, along with
their details. Transaction fees are paid in Data Credits. (Note that the cost is not shown in `HNT`
as this number is variable based on the current $USD/HNT price as defined by the HNT Price Oracle.)

| Fee Type                        | Fee Description                                                                                                  | **Cost (DC)** | Cost ($USD) |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------: | ----------: |
| Send HNT                        | Transferring HNT from wallet to wallet                                                                           |    `Variable` |  `Variable` |
| Transferring Device Packet Data | Fee paid by device owner when sending or receiving sensor data. Metered per 24 bytes.                            |           `1` |  `$0.00001` |
| Add Hotspot                     | Fee paid to add Hotspot to the blockchain. **Fee is generally covered by Hotspot maker**.                        |     `4000000` |    `$40.00` |
| Add Data Only Hotspot           | Fee paid to add a Data Only Hotspot to the blockchain.                                                           |     `1000000` |    `$10.00` |
| Assert Hotspot Location         | Required when asserting a Hotspot's location. \(The **first assertions** is generally covered by Hotspot maker\) |     `1000000` |    `$10.00` |
| Assert Data Only Location       | Required for Optionally asserting a Data Only Hotspot's Location                                                 |      `500000` |     `$5.00` |
| Purchasing a blockchain OUI     | Buy an OUI from the Helium blockchain                                                                            |    `10000000` |   `$100.00` |
| Purchasing a blockchain Subnet  | Buy a Subnet from the Helium blockchain                                                                          |    `10000000` |   `$100.00` |

## Calculating the DC cost for Sending HNT

As noted above, the `DC` cost of a `Send` transaction is variable. The precise cost is based on the
size of the transaction, in bytes. Once the size is calculated, we apply a `5000x` multiplier. For a
typical send transaction, where one wallet is sending to one wallet, the complete transaction is
made up of the following:

| Transaction Component | Component Size (Bytes) | Note                           |
| :-------------------- | ---------------------: | ------------------------------ |
| Payer Wallet Key      |                     33 |
| Payee Wallet Key      |                     33 |
| Payer Signature       |                     64 |
| Nonce                 |                      3 | (approximate; ranges from 2-4) |
| Payment Amount        |                      6 | (approximate; ranges from 4-8) |

- In total, this is `139` bytes.
- Each `24` bytes requires one Data Credit (as is the case when you're transferring device packet
  data).
- `139` / `24` results in `6` Data Credits.
- We then apply our 5000x multiplier, and the result is a transaction fee
- This results in a `30000 Data Credit` cost for the above transaction.

## Transaction Fees and Implicit Burn

:::caution Implicit Burn on Solana is Not Active

Implicit burn is not currently implemented on the Solana blockchain. To acquire the DC needed for
transactions, use the Helium Wallet app to swap HNT for DC manually.

The Helium blockchain uses something called `implicit burn` when paying fees.

**Implicit Burn™**

The term `implicit burn` was coined by Helium PM Coco "cokes" Tang, a recognized innovator in the
blockchain technology and terminology space.

Thanks to Implicit Burn™, if you have enough HNT in your wallet to pay the transaction fee, the
Helium Mobile Wallet (or the Helium Wallet CLI) will calculate the DC cost of your transaction and
the blockchain will automatically burn the precise amount of HNT to supply the required DCs for the
transaction. For example:

- You need to send `10 HNT` from a Helium Wallet that contains `11 HNT`
- The cost for this `send` transaction is `35000 DCs`
- Let's assume the `HNT/$USD` Oracle Price is `$.35` at the time you send the `HNT`. This means that
  you'll need to supply a `1HNT` to fund the `35000 DCs` for this transaction.
- When you send the `10 HNT`, the Helium Wallet automatically supplies the `1 HNT` to be burned into
  `DCs`.
- After the transaction is submitted and processed, your resulting Helium Wallet balance will be
  `0 HNT`.

In the above example, had you attempted to send `10.0001HNT` with only `11 HNT` in your wallet, this
transaction would have failed as burning `.999 HNT` would only result in `34965 DCs`, a mere 35 DCs
short of the `35000` required for a `send` transaction.

## Failed Transactions Result in No DCs Being Spent

Transactions in the Helium blockchain are `atomic`. In short, this means that they either succeed
entirely or they don't. So, if you attempt to send HNT from a Helium Wallet without enough HNT to
supply the required Data Credits, the transaction will fail after being submitted to the blockchain
API by your wallet. And your `HNT` balance will be the same. No `DCs` were burned (or harmed) in
this failed transaction.
