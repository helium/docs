Activating a commercially-produced device is often as simple as scanning a QR code or pairing with
an app. However, knowing the fundamentals of how LoRaWAN devices are onboarded, programmed, and
their data delivered helps to unlock the ideas and opportunities that come with these devices.
Therefore, this guide details the less common, but important principles of creating a custom-built
device on the Helium Network.

## Provisioning a Device

Many devices are pre-provisioned with keys. However, for this demonstration, we will create a new
set of keys for a device. The keys are used to authenticate the device on the network and encrypt
data. The keys are generated randomly in order to be unique to each device.

Generate a set of keys below by clicking the "Create Device" button:

  <CreateDevice />
</figure>
<br />

Behind the scenes, these keys have been submitted to a LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) which also
shares the Join EUI with the Helium Packet Router (HPR). With the Join EUI, HPR can receive payloads
from this device through any Hotspot in the world and route it to the appropriate LNS. Because these
keys are unique to the device and LNS, only the device and the LNS can decrypt the data transferred
between them.

## Building a Device

Consider the following code from
[the helium/longfi-platformio repository](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-basic/src/main.cpp):

Copy the keys generated above into the `devEui`, `appEui`, and `appKey` variables in the code below:

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <DocslabCodeBlock
    hardshare="heliumdev/cubecell-draw-demo"
    className="language-cpp"
    command="source .platformio/penv/bin/activate && cd m/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-basic && pio run -t upload && pio device monitor"
    destpath="m/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-basic/src/main.cpp"
    repoUrl="https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio.git"
    urlfile="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helium/longfi-platformio/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-oled/src/main.cpp"
  />
</figure>
<br />

Some more text over here maybe

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <DeviceEventLogger />
</figure>
<br />

If uplinks are shown in the logger above, the device is successfully sending data to the Helium
Network!

With the payloads received, the next step would be to send them to an application. LNSs typically
support a number of integrations like HTTP, MQTT, or bespoke integrations with platforms like AWS
IoT or Azure IoT.
