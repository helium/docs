A LoRaWAN Network Server, or "LNS", is a vital component of a LoRaWAN network. Key functions include
device management, message routing, and integration with application servers. Network servers play a
crucial role in ensuring the scalability, reliability, and interoperability of LoRaWAN networks.

## The OpenLNS Initiative

​The OpenLNS initiative allows anyone looking to deploy devices on the Helium Network to use any
LNS. The LNS you choose must comply with the LoRaWAN specification to access the Helium Network.

OpenLNS will deliver the following network improvements:

1. Increased accessibility
1. Accelerated device joins and a focus on increased speed
1. Increased reliability
1. Enabling massive scalability

      <h3>Work with a Service Provider</h3>
      <p className="podtext">
        Professional LNS hosting companies can provide support and immediate access to a ready-to-go
        connectivity platform. LNS Services will vary in price, support, and features depending on
        the company. Companies may offer public shared servers, and/or private servers.

      <h3>Host Your Own LNS</h3>
      <p className="podtext">
        If you are comfortable setting up, configuring, and managing your own servers and plan to
        self-manage your entire solution in-house, hosting your own LNS could be a good option for
        you. Note that this requires expertise and ongoing hosting expenses.
