The Helium Network is the world's largest LoRaWAN Network - and continues to grow at a staggering
pace. Because of this, it becomes a very attractive Network to other public and private LoRaWAN
Network Server providers (LNSs) who want to extend their coverage without deploying their own
infrastructure and capital.

And thanks to the Helium blockchain, direct roaming integrations are very simple. Most importantly,
major LNSs are roaming with the Helium Network, which means the public coverage the Helium Community is
building is now being used by LoRaWAN devices onboarded to other Networks, and Hotspot Operators get
compensated in $HNT for routing these packets.

## Helium Roaming Architecture

Helium Network roaming most closely resembles the LoRa Alliance's idea of "Passive Roaming". The
Helium Community operates a dedicated Roaming Server (the "Helium Roaming Server") that is distinct
from our core LNS for native Helium Devices. The Helium Roaming Server purchases all packets for a
target LoRaWAN `NetID` and forwards them to an endpoint ready to accept them on behalf of a Roaming
Partner's LNS. Specifically, the Helium Roaming Server connects any Helium Gateway that captures
target `NetID` packets via the Semtech GWMP UDP client.

## Actual Roaming Integration

To ingest packets as a roaming partner, you need to accept Semtech GWMP client connections for the
amount of Helium Hotspots that are receiving and routing your packets. Currently, this could be a
lot - assuming you are considering the entire global network. In practice, only a small percentage
of Helium Gateways will be routing packets for a roaming partner NetID simultaneously.

When the roaming PoC is initiated, Helium provides one or more IPs from where the connections will
originate. You will need to supply the IP and port for the host listening for Semtech GWMP
connections over UDP. Once provided, packets will start arriving at the specified host.

## Supported Device Functionality

Helium Roaming supports the following actions for devices:

- **Joining**: a new device provisioned to a roaming partner's LNS can join via the Helium Network.
  For new devices, `join_requests` and `join_accepts` are routed via Helium Hotspots.
- **Uplinking**: Once a device has joined, all device payloads are routed via Helium.
- **Downlinking**: All standard device downlinking is supported.
