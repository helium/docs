Before getting started, make sure to have the following:

- Helium Network Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI).
- Data Credits (>3.5M DC).
- A NetID issued by the LoRa Alliance.
- A roaming endpoint so your LNS can receive roaming traffic.

For guidance on purchasing and funding an OUI, refer to the following guides:

- [Buy an OUI](/iot/run-an-lns/buy-an-oui)
- [Fund an OUI](/iot/run-an-lns/fund-an-oui)

## Roaming Quickstart

While your roaming endpoint is up and running, you need to let the Helium config service know of its
existence. Initialization of some CLI environment variables will streamline the process:

Run `helium-config-service-cli env init`

1.  Fill in the relative path of the delegate key pair file for `Keypair Location`
1.  Fill in `Your Net ID` for `Net ID`
1.  Fill in your assigned OUI for `Assigned OUI`
1.  Fill in the number of `multi-buy` you want for `Default Max Copies` as a default for your
    routes.
1.  Then export the environment variables. This needs to be done manually. You will see something
    like this and just add `export` to each line and run it. For instance, you would run
    `export HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15` variable. Be sure not to put a space around the `=` sign

Now, you are ready to generate your first route. Routes contain the necessary information for us to
know how to route a packet â€” DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr range (for routing
uplinks), endpoint (so the network knows where to send the packet), etc.

1.  Run `helium-config-service-cli route new --commit`
1.  You can then see the empty route template. It should look like this, except that you should be
    seeing your NetID, assigned OUI, max_copies in there:

    className="add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
    style={{ maxHeight: 350, minWidth: 0 }}
  />

</figure> <br />

Next, let's define the endpoint that you use for ingesting traffic. You can run:

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route update server --host <roaming endpoint> --port <roaming port> --route-id <route-id> --commit
```

If you are using HTTP roaming, you need to run:

- Note that the auth-header and receiver-nsid are optional.

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route update http --dedupe-timeout <dedupe timeout> --path <roaming endpoint sub-path> --auth-header <auth header> --receiver-nsid <ReceiverNSID> --route-id <route-id> --commit
```

If you are using GWMP roaming, you need to run:

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route update add-gwmp-region --route-id <route-id> --commit
```

Make sure your endpoint, port and protocol are set correctly, otherwise we may not be able to send
traffic to your LNS.

### How to Add Your First Device

In this example, we will show you how to add your first device to start roaming. In order to receive
join request for your device, you need to let Helium know which EUI pair to watch out for. You can
run the following

**If you are a roaming partner migrating from Roaming Console, please read the
`Migrating from Roaming Console` section below first.**

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route euis add --route-id <route-id> -d <dev-eui> -a <app-eui> --commit
```

While this allows your Helium to forward your device's join request, you also need to specify a
DevAddr range on that route so that Helium can forward its uplinks.

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route devaddrs add -s <start devAddr> -e <end devAddr> --route-id <route-id> -- commit
```

### Migrating from Roaming Console

If you are a roaming partner migrating from Roaming Console to the new OpenLNS Architecture, please
carefully test out your roaming connections before the full switch.

While the Roaming Console currently coexists with the OpenLNS Architecture, it is not possible to
have the same device to simultaneously send traffic to both Roaming Console and through OpenLNS
Architecture.

#### Migrating EUI Pair for Join Requests

Let's say you had 100 devices on Roaming Console, you can start the migration slowly by registering
1 EUI pair with the CLI, so that 99 of your devices will roam through Roaming Console and 1 of your
devices will roam through OpenLNS. Then, you can keep migrating, possibly registering 50 EUI pairs
with the CLI, so that 49 of your devices will roam through Roaming Console and 51 will roam through
OpenLNS. Eventually, you will have registered all 100 EUI pairs with the CLI, so that all of your
devices will roam through Roaming Console.

#### Migrating DevAddr Range for Uplinks

Let's say you have 10 DevAddrs, you can start the migration slowly by registering 1 DevAddr with the
CLI, so that 9 of your DevAddrs will roam through Roaming Console and 1 of your DevAddrs will roam
through OpenLNS. Then, you can keep migrating, possibly registering 5 DevAddrs with the CLI, so that
4 of your DevAddrs will roam through Roaming Console and 6 will roam through OpenLNS. Eventually,
you will have registered all 10 DevAddrs with the CLI, so that all of your devices will roam through
Roaming Console.

## Advanced Roaming

### Session Key Filter

The session key filter gives an opertator the ability to accept and reject specific roaming traffic
on a device level. Leveraging the session key filter is recommended for all operators. Read more
about the session key filter in the
[LNS advanced configuration](/iot/run-an-lns/advanced-configuration#session-key-filter).

### Proxy Service

If Helium's OpenLNS Architecture is a deal breaker for you, then you can leverage
[this service we prototyped](https://github.com/helium/helium-packet-router-ingest), which should
provide you with a standard roaming interface. Note that Helium is not in active maintenance of this
service. Helium does not necessarily recommend the usage of this architecture, but appreciates the
diverse needs of roaming partners.
