OpenLNS is the platform that enables any LoRaWAN network to use Helium's IoT Network. In this guide,
we'll walk you through the process of setting up and configuring OpenLNS.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Helium Network OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
- Helium LoRaWAN devAddr slab
- LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS). A popular option is [ChirpStack][chirpstack]. Refer to the
  ChirpStack documentation for setup and integration instructions.

## Purchasing OUI and devAddr Slab

To purchase an OUI and devAddr slab, you will need to use the Helium Foundation's tool. The OUI
costs $100 paid in Data Credits (DC), while the devAddr slab mandates a minimum of 8 devAddrs that
cost $100 each.

## Managing Your OUI with the Config Service

After your OUI and devAddr are added, you can now manage your OUI through the Config Service. You
can interact with the Config Service in two ways:

1. Directly through [GRPC APIs][grpc-api]
2. Using the [Command-Line Interface (CLI)][config-cli] detailed below

### Authenticating with the Config Service

Before interacting with the Config Service, generate a key pair to authenticate your interactions,
so only you can create, modify, or delete routes. Run:

```sh
./helium-config-service-cli env generate-keypair --commit
```

You should find a file called keypair.bin. Print out the public key of your key pair by running:

```sh
./helium-config-service-cli env info --keypair keypair.bin
```

### Initialize CLI

CLI can be initialized with environment variables so common variables don't have to be reiterated in
subsequent commands.

```sh
./helium-config-service-cli env init
```

- Fill in `http://mainnet-config.helium.io:6080/` for `Config Service Host`
- Fill in the path `./keypair.bin` for `Keypair Location`
- Fill in the Helium NetID, `0x00003C`
- Fill in your OUI for `Assigned OUI`
- Fill in the number of multi-buy you want for `Default Max Copies` as a default for your routes.

Then export the environment variables.

```sh
export HELIUM_CONFIG_HOST=http://mainnet-config.helium.io:6080/
export HELIUM_KEYPAIR_BIN=./keypair.bin
export HELIUM_NET_ID=00003C
export HELIUM_OUI=1
export HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=10
```

### Managing Routes

You are now ready to generate your first route. Routes contain the necessary information to let the
IoT network know how to route a packet; DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr range
(for routing uplinks), endpoint (where to send the packet to), etc.

```sh
./helium-config-service-cli route new --commit
```

You can then see the empty route template. It should look like this, except that you should be
seeing you own assigned OUI, max_copies, and other environment variables.

```json
✔️ created route 7a5560e8-b722-11ed-bbe8-c3404da5a84d
{
  "id": "7a5560e8-b722-11ed-bbe8-c3404da5a84d",
  "net_id": "C00053",
  "oui": 3,
  "server": {
    "host" : "",
    "port": 0,
    "protocol": {
      "type" : "packet_router"
    }
  },
  "max copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false
}
```

Define DevAddr range so the packet router knows which uplinks to route to your endpoint. Use your
OUI's assigned DevAddr range, which you can get by running `./helium-config-service-cli org get`

To add your DevAddr range run

```
./helium-config-service-cli route devaddrs add -s <start> -e <end> --route-id <route-id> --commit
```

Next, define EUI pairs so the packet router knows which join requests to route to your endpoint.

```
./helium-config-service-cli route euis add --route-id <route-id> -d <dev-eui> -a <app-eui> --commit
```

Define your endpoint by running

```
./helium-config-service-cli route update server --host <host> --port <port> --route-id <route-id> --commit
```
