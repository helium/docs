The Open LNS initiative allows anyone looking to deploy devices on the Helium Network to use any
LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS). The LNS you choose must compile with the LoRaWAN specification to
access the Helium Network.

## Why Open LNS?

Open LNS will deliver the following network improvements:

1. Increased accessibility
2. Accelerated device joins and a focus on increased speed
3. Increased reliability
4. Enabling massive scalability

## Console & LNS Migration

The Open LNS Initiative is unaffected by the migration to Solana. LNS Operators and Console Users
will have months to migrate their LNS services.

Open LNS allows devices on the Helium Network to use any LoRaWAN Network Server ("LNS") that
complies with the LoRaWAN specification.

<!-- TODO: what is an LNS -->
<!-- - The LoRaWAN Network Server is the brain and the controller of a LoRaWAN network. -->
<!-- - connection from hotspot to the internet -->
<!-- - respnsible for data routing -->
<!-- - security -->

## Network Improvements

Before Open LNS, Helium LoRaWAN Network Servers ran on bespoke software especially suited to the
Helium Blockchain. Through Helium HIP-70, these constraints were removed, allowing for a multitude
of simplifications and improvements.

**Increased Accessibility:** <br/> Open LNS alleviates the usage and access bottlenecks that stem
from "Helium Console" as the only LNS option and instead scales network access through a large and
diverse set of LNS providers and software suites.

**Accelerated Device Joins:** <br/> The re-engineered backend architecture removes the need to store
device routing information on the Helium blockchain, dramatically reducing device join time.

**Increased Reliability:** <br/> By colocating in the same global regions as deployed Hotspots,
additional Oracles can support future demand, reduce latency, and increase redundancy.

**Enable Massive Scalability:** <br/> The upgraded architecture allows for new device classes and
innovative use cases, with new LoRaWAN infrastructure allowing IoT providers to utilize whichever
LNS they prefer based on features and capabilities.

## Open LNS FAQ

### Why Are These Changes Necessary?

In the current architecture, Helium Console is a blockchain-following node. This blockchain
dependency adds cost and complexity and can cause speed and efficiency issues, including device
joins delays and slow, delayed, or dropped packet communications. In addition, the current
architecture limits the scalability to handle future network growth. IoT solution providers can only
access part of the catalog of LoRaWAN-capable devices, and there are limited options regarding how
these devices onboard to the Helium Network.

Moving data transfer to [Oracles][oracles] will eliminate the need for data transfer accounting
dependent on the blockchain and other chain-following entities, eliminates the issues noted above
while enabling data transfer to massively scale, and removes the fear of chain halts affecting the
underlying Network.

### How Would Open LNS Provide More Access To The Network?

Open LNS allows partners in the ecosystem to use any LNS that complies with the LoRaWAN
specification to access the Helium Network.

:::note New Capabilities.

The Helium Console does not support standard LoRaWAN features such as ABP activation or Class C
devices. Open LNS allows users to choose a different LNS, such as Chirpstack to address these
limitations.

:::

Reimagining this landscape of LNS providers offers users a new level of freedom and flexibility.

### What Is The Current Progress And Future Timeline?

Alpha testing began in October 2022. After a successful initial alpha period, a larger group of
partners in the ecosystem are participating in the ongoing beta test and are seeing positive
evidence that ABP and Class C devices will be fully functional on the Helium Network.

Testing will continue through the start of 2023.
