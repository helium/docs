Helium Roaming Services enables public and private LoRaWAN Network providers around the world to
leverage Helium’s ubiquitous coverage.

With over 993K Hotspots in 190 countries and growing, the Network sees a massive amount of
non-Helium packets. When Network providers enter a roaming partnership with Helium, this traffic can
be forwarded via the Helium Network to partners, increasing their level of service and coverage.

Any compatible device can send data to their Home Network through Helium-compatible Hotspots without
the need for device configurations or firmware updates.

## Getting Started

- **Create an Account** - Contact a Helium Network Advisor to create the initial Helium Roaming
  Services account (sales@nova-labs.com). Initial setup requires an Organization name, and an email
  address for the administrator. As part of the initial account creation process, Net ID ownership
  must be verified for the roaming partner.
- **Add Users** - An administrator can add other user accounts with various roles as needed.
- **Purchase Data Credits** - Data Credits (DCs) are needed to pay for packets sent on the Helium
  Network and can be purchased with a credit card or burning HNT.
- **Configure Network Integration** - Specify the Home network Server address and port, input
  roaming device join credentials, and define how many packets to purchase for devices.
- **Set up Alerts** - Set up email alerts to send to different user roles based on a number of
  conditions including Data Credit balance, user management, or payment methods.

## Users & Organizations

Administrators can add invite users to Organizations via email. Users can be given different access
levels using roles (administrators, managers, and read-only users).

### Adding Users

User roles include:

- `Administrators` can perform all actions
- `Managers` have the same permissions as administrators, but cannot add organizations, manage
  users, or Data Credits
- `Read-only` users cannot take any actions

**To add a new user**

- On Console navigate to the **Users** page, and click **+ Add User**. A pop-up appears.
- Type the email of the new user, and select their desired access level.
- Hit **Submit**. An email invitation is sent that allows a user to join the organization.

### Managing Organizations

Organizations allow users to manage multiple roaming servers using the same account. An Organization
is a virtual container with its own users, Data Credit balance, and configurations.

**Note:** Data Credits can be transferred among Organizations, see Purchasing Data Credits.

**To add a new Organization**

- On Console navigate to the **Organizations** page, and click **+ Add Organizations**. A pop-up
  appears.
- Type the unique name of the Organization.
- Hit **Submit**, the Organization appears.

## Data Credits

Data Credits (DCs) are needed to pay for packets sent on the Helium Network. Every 24 bytes sent in
a packet costs 1 DC which equals $0.00001.

### Purchasing Data Credits

Obtaining Data Credits is the same as on the Helium Console focused on device management and
onboarding. Users can use a credit card (recommended method) and set up a recurring payment or burn
HNT. For a video tutorial of how to purchase Data Credits on Console, check out our Tips & Tricks
video [here](https://youtu.be/jyMGLymuOCE).

In addition to purchasing Data Credits, users can transfer Data Credits among Organizations under
the same account.

To transfer Data Credits (same account only with multiple Organizations): click **Data Credits**,
and hit **Transfer DC to Org**. On the pop up, enter the quantity of Data Credits to transfer and
receiving Organization. Click **Make Transfer**.

## Configurations

There are a number of configurations required to successfully roam on Helium including:

- Configuring the Home Network Server address and port number
- Adding roaming device join credentials
- Specifying how many packets to purchase for devices

### Configuring Integrations

To configure the Helium Roaming Service with a LoRaWAN Network Server a user needs to provide the
address of the Home Network Server and the port number.

On Console, click Configuration and enter the Address (for example yournetworkserver.com) and port
number (for example `1700`) of the Home Network Server

### Adding Device Credentials

Any device that roams on the Helium Network needs to be added to the Configuration page.

Join credentials can be added using multiple methods. Click **Configuration**, and to:

- **Add an individual device**: choose **+Add Join Credential** and enter the device DevEUI and APP
  EUI
- **Import devices with a CSV file**: choose **use CSV File**. To structure the CSV file, add
  app_eui, dev_eui in the header row, followed by rows of the corresponding values.
- **Use a wildcard**: Rather than adding each device, DevEUI’s mapped to a single AppEUI can be
  added using an asterisk wildcard `*`. Choose **+Add Join Credential** and enter `*` for the DevEUI
  field along with the specific AppEUI. Each new AppEUI requires a new entry.

### Purchasing Multiple Packets

The Multiple Packets feature provides the ability to pay for additional packets (if available) for
redundancy and location triangulation purposes.

To enable multiple packet purchase, click **Configuration**, and enter the number of desired
packets. Note: additional packets can only be purchased if multiple Hotspots "hear" and send the
same packet. By default, only `1` packet is purchased.

## Alerts

Email alerts can be set up for a number of conditions related to Data Credit balance, user
management, or payment methods. User types (e.g., Administrator or Managers) can be specified to
receive alerts.

### Setting Up Alerts

To set up email alerts: click **Alerts**, choose alert and user role to receive alerts.
