## Session Key Filter (SKF) {#session-key-filter}

Session Key Filters (SKF) regulate device traffic on specific devAddrs by utilizing LoRaWAN device
session keys. They establish conditions to either permit or restrict data flow based on the
configured session keys. It essentially allows the LNS operators to accept and reject traffic on a
device (session) level.

In this example scenario, consider two device addresses (devAddr) 1 and 2:

- **Provided Session Key for devAddr 1 and "ignore empty skf" = false:**  
  Only allows traffic through devAddr 1 if it passes Message Integrity Code (MIC) checks.
- **No Session Key for devAddr 2 and "ignore empty skf" = false:**  
  All traffic is allowed through devAddr 2 without MIC checks.
- **No Session Key for devAddr 2 and "ignore empty skf" = true:**  
  All traffic through devAddr 2 is blocked.

The SKF will regulate traffic based on session key availability and the "ignore empty skf" flag,
independently per devAddr.

### Importance of Configuring Session Key Filters

Configuring SKFs for devices introduces an additional layer of security on the Helium network. In
instances where SKFs are not established, the network relies on the devAddr to associate packets
with the respective OUI, potentially attributing unauthorized packet costs to the OUI owner.

Implementing SKFs counteracts this risk by empowering the Helium Packet Router to authenticate
packets, thus preventing the delivery of unwanted payloads (and their respective DC cost).

## Automated EUI and SKF Route Updates

As the ecosystem of LNS operators grows, an increasing number of developers have open-sourced their
tooling for running a Helium-enabled LNS. These tools enable functionality such as EUI and SKF
automation to per-tenant Data Credit accounting.

A selection of the tools are outlined below.

### Helium Route Updater

The Helium Route Updater service is a third-party service that can be run alongside a ChirpStack
deployment to automate the adding/removing of EUIs as well as enabling session key filters on
devices to block traffic from devices that are not yours.

You can find the service on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/thisisdevelopment/helium-route-updater). There is also a section in the
readme that details how to easily add it to your ChirpStack docker compose, found
[here](https://github.com/thisisdevelopment/helium-route-updater#chirpstack-docker-compose-usage).

### Disk91 Helium Chirpstack

This service includes several utilities including EUI management and per-tenant accounting.

Find the service on GitHub [here](https://github.com/disk91/helium-chirpstack).

### Chirpstack-hpr by Bones

This service includes several utilities including EUI and SKF management.

## Config Service Interaction

The Config Service can be used to manage an OUI and devAddr. There are two ways to interact with the
Config Service:

1. Using the [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/helium/helium-config-service-cli).
1. Alternatively, you can write scripts to interact with the Config Service directly through
   [GRPC APIs](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/service/iot_config.proto) for a more
   programmatic approach.

## Hotspot Location Data

Hotspot location data can be requested from the Config Service using either the CLI or GRPC APIs.

## Add and Remove Delegate Keys

Note that only owner key can perform the actions below. OUI owners can add
delegate keys by running

```bash
helium-config-service-cli org update delegate-add --pubkey <public key of the delegate key pair you are trying to add> --keypair <relative path of your **owner** keypair path> --commit
```

OUI owners can remove delegate keys by running

```bash
helium-config-service-cli org update delegate-remove --pubkey <public key of the delegate key pair you are trying to remove> --keypair <relative path of your **owner** keypair path> --commit
```
