## Session Key Filter (SKF)

let's say you have devaddr 1 and 2

if you submitted sk on devaddr 1, then HPR will only let traffic through on devaddr 1 if we can MIC check it with one of the sk
if you didn't submit any sk on devaddr 2 and the the flag "ignore empty skf" = false, then HPR lets all traffic through on devaddr 2
if you didn't submit any sk on devaddr 2 and the the flag "ignore empty skf" = true, then HPR blocks all traffic through on devaddr 2

## Config Service Interaction
The Config Service can be used to manage an OUI and devAddr. There are two ways to interact with the
Config Service:

1. Using the [Command-Line Interface ("CLI")](https://github.com/helium/helium-config-service-cli)
   detailed below.
2. Alternatively, you can also write scripts to interact with the Config Service directly through
   [GRPC APIs](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/service/iot_config.proto) for a more
   programmatic approach


## Hotspot Location Data

You can request hotspot location data from the Config Service using the CLI or GRPC APIs.
