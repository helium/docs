## Session Key Filter (SKF)

Session key filters enable you to allow or block device traffic on specific devAddrs using LoRaWAN device
device session keys.

As an example, say you have devaddr 1 and 2:  

- If you submitted a session key on devaddr 1 to the config service, then HPR will only let traffic through on devaddr 1 if it can be MIC checked with one of the session keys  
- If you did not submit a session key on devaddr 2 and the flag "ignore empty skf" = false, then HPR will let all traffic through on devaddr 2  
- If you did not submit a session key on devaddr 2 and the flag "ignore empty skf" = true, then HPR will block all traffic on devaddr 2  

## Automated EUI and SKF Route updates

Helium Route Updater  
The helium route updater service is a third party service that can be run alongside a Chirpstack deployment
to automate the adding/removing of EUIs as well as enabling session key filters on devices to block traffic
from devices that are not yours. 

You can find the service on GitHub [here](https://github.com/thisisdevelopment/helium-route-updater).
There is also a section in the Readme that details how to easily add it to your Chirpstack docker compose, found
 [here](https://github.com/thisisdevelopment/helium-route-updater#chirpstack-docker-compose-usage).



## Config Service Interaction
The Config Service can be used to manage an OUI and devAddr. There are two ways to interact with the
Config Service:

1. Using the [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/helium/helium-config-service-cli).
2. Alternatively, you can write scripts to interact with the Config Service directly through
   [GRPC APIs](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/service/iot_config.proto) for a more
   programmatic approach


## Hotspot Location Data

You can request hotspot location data from the Config Service using the CLI or GRPC APIs.
