# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## No Incoming Data On The LNS

If data is not being delivered to the LNS when there is a strong expectation that it should be, it's
helpful to double-check route and device configuration. A common mistake is that routes are not
properly configured or the devEUI of the testing device is not added to the route.

Review the [routing configuration](/configure-routing-rules) guides.

## Join Request Received But Nothing Else

If the join process is successful but no further data is delivered, a common issue is that the
Session Key Filter is enabled for the route, but the session key of the specific device has not been
submitted. This effectively blocks all downlink activity for the omitted device.

Review the [session key filter](/advanced-configuration) information in the
advanced configuration guides.

## Joins Unsuccessful

As outlined in the [Understanding Multibuy](/fund-an-oui) section,
if multibuy is not enabled, there is a chance that the nearest Hotspot or Hotspot with the strongest
signal is not available to the LNS for the join-accept.

Multipacket configuration on the route or session key filter allows HPR to forward more of the
uplinks (in chronological order) to the LNS. This lets the LNS make the selection of the best
candidate to handle the join-accept response or other downlink activity. Low RSSI/SNR values from
the gateway[s] reporting the join request/uplink is a good sign that increasing the multibuy value
should be considered.

If RSSI/SNR values continue to be low, it may be necessary to deploy additional coverage. Review the
[data-only Hotspot](/iot/data-only-hotspots) guides for steps on adding Helium functionality to any
existing LoRaWAN gateway.
