# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Data transfer stopped {#device-transfer-stopped}

If data transfer was working before but stopped suddenly, please check the
[status page](https://status.helium.com/) and see if there is any ongoing incident with Helium
Packet Router.

If there was no incident, please check if your OUI was locked due to insufficient DC balance. Lock
status can be verified by checking whether the "locked" field for each of your route is `true` or
`false`. Query your routes by running

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route list --commit
```

OUI DC balance can be checked with the
[DC balance widget](/iot/run-an-lns/fund-an-oui#tracking-oui-balance).

## LNS receives neither join requests nor uplinks

Please first follow the same advice on investigating
[why your device transfer might be unsuccessful](/iot/run-an-lns/common-issues#device-transfer-stopped).

If those scenarios were ruled out, it's helpful to double-check route and device configuration. A
common mistake is that routes are not properly configured or the devEUI of the testing device is not
added to the route.

Review the [routing configuration](configure-routing-rules) guides.

## LNS receives Join Requests but device unable to join

Device may have issue joining the Network if the RSSI/SNR values are sub-optimal. In practice,
difficulty to join tends to show up when the RSSI value is worse than -120.

As outlined in the [Understanding Max Copies](/iot/run-an-lns/advanced-configuration#max-copies)
section, join performance can be improved with max copies setting.

If RSSI/SNR values continue to be low even after the max copies setting, it may be necessary to
deploy additional coverage. Review the [data-only Hotspot](/iot/data-only-hotspots) guides for steps
on adding Helium functionality to any existing LoRaWAN gateway.

## Device able to join but not uplink

If the join process is successful but no further data is delivered, a common issue is that the
Session Key Filter is enabled for the route, but the session key of the specific device has not been
submitted. This effectively blocks all downlink activity for the omitted device.

Check if your route has enabled
[Session Key Filter](/iot/run-an-lns/advanced-configuration#session-key-filter). If so, check if the
device's Network Session Key is registered in that route by running

```bash
helium-config-service-cli route skfs list --route-id <route-id>
```

You can find your device's Network Session Key in Chirpstack in the device's Activation tab.

## Cannot perform routing changes

If you cannot perform routing changes such as updating EUI list, SKF list, max copy setting OR if
all of your old devices are sending data but not your newly provisioned devices. Please check the
[status page](https://status.helium.com/) and see if there is any ongoing incident with
Configuration Service.
