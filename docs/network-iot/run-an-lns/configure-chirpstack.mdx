Before getting started, make sure to have the following:

- Helium Network Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI).
- Helium LoRaWAN devAddr slab.
- Data Credits (>3.5M DC).

## Installation and Configuration

There are several methods to install ChirpStack on a server. This guide will demonstrate a
configuration using Docker and the
[`chirpstack-docker`](https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-docker) repository.

```sh title="Clone the ChirpStack Docker repository."
git clone https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-docker.git
```

### Configure ChirpStack

Open and edit the `chirpstack.toml` file located in `configuration/chirpstack`.

Modify the following sections:

- Under `[network]`:
  - Set `net_id` to `00003C`
  - Add `dev_addr_prefixes` with the devAddr slab assigned. Follow these steps to set it up:
    - Run `helium-config-service-cli org get --OUI <OUI>` to retrieve the DevAddr constraints for
      the OUI.
    - Execute `helium-config-service-cli subnet-mask <starting DevAddr> <ending DevAddr>` to
      identify subnets.
    - In the ChirpStack `.toml` file, insert `dev_addr_prefixes = [<subnets>]` following the rule:
      starting `devAddr/32-log2(devAddr slab size)`. For instance, if 8 devAddr slabs were requested
      and the starting devAddr is 00000000, insert `dev_addr_prefixes = ["00000000/29"]`.
    - If the OUI has multiple non-sequential DevAddr ranges, separate the prefixes by comma. For
      instance, dev_addr_prefixes = ["00000000/29", "00000010/29"]
- Under `[gateway]`:
  - Add `allow_unknown_gateways=true`

## Support Additional LoRaWAN Regions

To support regions beyond the default EU868, deploy a gateway bridge in ChirpStack for each
additional LoRaWAN region. Although this tutorial demonstrates adding support for US915, these steps
can be adapted for other regions.

Open `docker-compose.yml` and locate a container called `chirpstack-gateway-bridge-eu868`.

Add the following.

```yml
chirpstack-gateway-bridge-us915:
    image: chirpstack/chirpstack-gateway-bridge:4
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 1701:1700/udp
    volumes:
      - /helium/configuration/chirpstack-gateway-bridge-us915:/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge
    depends_on:
      - mosquitto
    logging: *logs
```

Navigate to the `configuration/chirpstack-gateway-bridge` directory and create a new directory named
`chirpstack-gateway-bridge-us915`.

Inside this new directory, create a file named `chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml` and insert the
following content:

```toml
[integration.mqtt.auth.generic]
servers=["tcp://mosquitto:1883"]
username=""
password=""

[integration.mqtt]
event_topic_template="us915_1/gateway/{{ .GatewayID }}/event/{{ .EventType }}"
state_topic_template="us915_1/gateway/{{ .GatewayID }}/state/{{ .StateType }}"
command_topic_template="us915_1/gateway/{{ .GatewayID }}/command/#"
```

See https://www.chirpstack.io/docs/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/configuration.html for a full
configuration example and documentation.

Make sure ports 1700 and 1701 are both open on the server.

## Example `chirpstack.toml` with Helium Additions

```toml
# Network related configuration.
[network]

  # Network identifier (NetID, 3 bytes) encoded as HEX (e.g. 010203).
  # new helium net_id="00003C"
  net_id="00003C"

  # Helium 8 block dev address prefix 29
  # if you have multiple blocks you can add them as an array
  dev_addr_prefixes=[
    "78000000/29"
  ]

  # Enabled regions.
  #
  # Multiple regions can be enabled simultaneously. Each region must match
  # the 'name' parameter of the region configuration in '[[regions]]'.
  enabled_regions=[
    "au915_1",
    "eu868",
    "in865",
    "kr920",
    "us915_1",
  ]

  # Time to wait for uplink de-duplication.
  #
  # This is the time that ChirpStack will wait for other gateways to receive
  # the same uplink frame. Please note that this value affects the
  # roundtrip time. The total roundtrip time (which includes network latency)
  # must be less than the (first) receive-window.
  deduplication_delay="200ms"


# API interface configuration.
[api]

  # interface:port to bind the API interface to.
  bind="0.0.0.0:8080"

  # Secret.
  #
  # This secret is used for generating login and API tokens, make sure this
  # is never exposed. Changing this secret will invalidate all login and API
  # tokens. The following command can be used to generate a random secret:
  #   openssl rand -base64 32
  secret="REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-SECRET-HERE"


# Global gateway configuration.
# Please note that backend configuration can be found in the per-region
# configuration.
[gateway]
  # Allow unknown gateways.
  #
  # If set to true, then uplinks received from gateways not configured in
  # ChirpStack will be allowed.
  allow_unknown_gateways=true
```

## Run ChirpStack

Run `docker-compose up` to start the server. Utilize the default credentials to log in:

Username: admin  
Password: admin

Now that the LNS is operational, proceed to establish routing rules. This ensures that the Helium
Network accurately directs device packets to the designated LNS. Learn how to implement this in the
[Routing Rules Configuration Guide](configure-routing-rules).
