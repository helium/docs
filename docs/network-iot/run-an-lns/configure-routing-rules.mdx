While ChirpStack is up and running for you, you need to let
[Config Service](/oracles/data-transfer-oracles#config-service) know of its existence. First, let's
initialize some environment variables so that you don't have to tell the CLI the same commands over
and over again:

Run `helium-config-service-cli env init`

1.  Fill in the relative path of your delegate key pair file for `Keypair Location`
1.  Fill in `0x00003C` for `Net ID`
1.  Fill in your OUI for `Assigned OUI`
1.  Fill in the number of `multi-buy` you want for `Default Max Copies` as a default for your
    routes.
1.  Then export the environment variables. This needs to be done manually. You will see something
    like this and just add `export` to each line and run it. For instance, you would run
    `export HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15` variable. Do NOT put a space around the `=` sign

Now, you are ready to generate your first route. Routes contain the necessary information for us to
know how to route a packet — DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr range (for routing
uplinks), Endpoint (so we know where to send the packet to), etc.

1.  Run `helium-config-service-cli route new --commit`
1.  You can then see the empty route template. It should look like this, except that you should be
    seeing your Net ID, assigned OUI, max_copies in there:

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('img/open-lns/roaming-setup-generate-route.png')}
    className="add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
    style={{ maxHeight: 350, minWidth: 0 }}
  />

</figure> <br />

Next, let's define the endpoint that you use for ingesting traffic. You can run:

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route update server --host <server ip> --port 1700 --route-id <route-id> --commit
```

Finally, let's make sure you specify the port for each LoRaWAN region you plan on supporting on your
ChirpStack. In our example, run

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route update add-gwmp-region —route-id <route-id> us915 1701 eu868 1700 --commit
```

### How to Add Your First Device

In this example, we will show you how to add a US915 OTAA Class A device. On ChirpStack, navigate to
Device Profiles, and hit `Add device profile`. Name it something descriptive like
`US915 OTAA Class A`, and change the Region to US915 in the drop-down. Leave everything else as
default.

Navigate to Applications, and add an application if you don't have one yet. In that application, hit
`Add device`. Fill in the `Name`, `Device EUI` and select the device profile you just created.

Now that the device is successfully created on ChirpStack, you need to let Config Service know about
it, you need to run

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route euis add --route-id <route-id> -d <dev-eui> -a <app-eui> --commit
```

While this allows your device to join the Helium Network, you also need to specify a DevAddr range
on that route so the device can also send uplink. It is recommended to set your route DevAddr to be
the devAddr slab of your OUI. Run

```bash
$ helium-config-service-cli route devaddrs add -s <start devAddr> -e <end devAddr> --route-id <route-id> -- commit
```

If you know all the possible EUIs ahead of time that you will use for your application, then you can
add them all and not have to worry about it after that. If you don't then you'll have to add them as
you go.

You now have a fully functioning LNS on the Helium IoT network. For additional advanced
configurations, please see [here](advanced-configuration).
