With ChirpStack up and running, OUI-specific routing and sensor configurations can be added to the
[Helium Config Service](/oracles/data-transfer-oracles#config-service) to enable sensor data to be
routed to the ChirpStack instance.

:::info

If ChirpStack was deployed with the Docker Compose configuration, routing rules will need to be 
manually configured. 

However, if ChirpStack was deployed with the Kubernetes configuration, routing rules are 
programatically added via the Helium Network sidecar application and do not need to be manually 
configured in the manner described below.

:::

## Initialize Helium Config Service CLI

First, initialize the Helium Config Service CLI by running `helium-config-service-cli env init`. A
series of prompts, as noted below, will be provided in the terminal session.

1. For `Config Service Host`, press enter to use the default value (e.g.,
   `https://config.iot.mainnet.helium.io:6080`).
2. For `Keypair Location`, provide the location of the delegate keypair in the local filesystem.
3. For `Net ID`, provide `00003C`.
4. For `Assigned OUI`, provide your assigned OUI number.
5. For `Default Max Copies`, press enter to use the default value (e.g., `15`).

After providing the initialization information, an output similar to the below will be provided:

```sh
Put these in your environment
------------------------------------
HELIUM_KEYPAIR_BIN=<./your/path/to/delegate/keypair.bin>
HELIUM_NET_ID=00003C
HELIUM_OUI=<OUI_ID>
HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15
```

Second, as suggested in the output, export the suggested environment variables into the terminal
session. This needs to be done manually. To do so, just add `export` to each line in the manner
provided below and run the commands:

```sh title="Setting environment variables in a terminal window."
export HELIUM_KEYPAIR_BIN=<./your/path/to/delegate/keypair.bin>
export HELIUM_NET_ID=00003C
export HELIUM_OUI=<OUI_ID>
export HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15
```

## Generate Route in Helium Config Service

Routes contain the necessary information for the
[Helium Packet Router](/oracles/data-transfer-oracles#packet-router-service) to know how to route a
packet sent from a sensor to the proper LNS. In particular, Helium Packet Router leverages
information provided in a generated route such as DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr
range (for routing uplinks), and LNS endpoint to inform routing decisions.

To generate a route via the Helium Config Service CLI, run the `helium-config-service-cli route new`
command. As shown below, the command will perform a "dry run" if the `--commit` flag isn't provided.
In such cases when the `--commit` flag isn't provided, the command will show what would have been
transmitted to the Helium Config Service (e.g., a configuration service which informs routing
behavior of the Helium Packet Router). In this way, you can review the route information prior to
formally submitting.

```sh
helium-config-service-cli route new
```

```sh
== DRY RUN == (pass `--commit`)
{
  "id": "",
  "net_id": "00003C",
  "oui": <oui>,
  "server": {
    "host": "",
    "port": 0,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "packet_router"
    }
  },
  "max_copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false,
  "ignore_empty_skf": false
}
```

Once the result looks satisfactory, simply run `helium-config-service-cli route new --commit` to
submit the route to Helium Config Service.

## Configure Route in Helium Config Service

After generating a route, the route needs to be configured for the ChirpStack implementation. This
will involve specifying the ChirpStack endpoint and default port and adding LoRaWAN region-specific
routing configuration.

### Specify ChirpStack Endpoint and Default Port

To specify the ChirpStack endpoint and default port, use the Helium Config Service CLI and run the
`helium-config-service-cli route update server` command. As shown below, the command will perform a
"dry run" if the `--commit` flag isn't provided.

In preparing the command, please note that the `--host` flag should point to the IP address of the
server running the ChirpStack instance, the `--port` flag serves as the default for routing messages
to ChirpStack, and the `--route-id` flag corresponds to the route that was just created.

```sh
helium-config-service-cli route update server --host <server ip> --port <port> --route-id <route id>
```

```sh
== DRY RUN == (pass `--commit`)
Updated <route id>
== Old
{
  "id": <route id>,
  "net_id": "00003C",
  "oui": <oui>,
  "server": {
    "host": "",
    "port": 0,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "packet_router"
    }
  },
  "max_copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false,
  "ignore_empty_skf": false
}
== New
{
  "id": <route id>,
  "net_id": "00003C",
  "oui": <oui>,
  "server": {
    "host": <server ip>,
    "port": <port>,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "packet_router"
    }
  },
  "max_copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false,
  "ignore_empty_skf": false
}
```

Once the result looks as desired, simply re-run the command with the ` --commit` to update the
route.

### Add LoRaWAN Region-Specific Routing Configuration

To add LoRaWAN region-specific routing configuration, use the Helium Config Service CLI and run the
`helium-config-service-cli route update add-gwmp-region` command. As shown below, the command will
perform a "dry run" if the `--commit` flag isn't provided.

In preparing the command, the LoRaWAN region is proceeded by the port to be used for the region. For
example, in the example command below, the region `us915` is proceeded by `<us915 port>`. Here, the
`<us915 port>` value will mirror the port bound to the `chirpstack-gateway-bridge-us915` container
(e.g., `1701`).

Please note that the command will also need to be run for the `eu868` region for port `1700`.

```sh
helium-config-service-cli route update add-gwmp-region --route-id <route-id> us915 <us915 port>
```

```sh
== DRY RUN == (pass `--commit`)
Updated <route id>
== Old
{
  "id": <route id>,
  "net_id": "00003C",
  "oui": <oui>,
  "server": {
    "host": "",
    "port": 0,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "packet_router"
    }
  },
  "max_copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false,
  "ignore_empty_skf": false
}
== New
{
  "id": <route id>,
  "net_id": "00003C",
  "oui": <oui>,
  "server": {
    "host": "",
    "port": 0,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "gwmp",
      "mapping": {
        "US915": 1701
      }
    }
  },
  "max_copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false,
  "ignore_empty_skf": false
}
```

After adding the LoRaWAN region-specific routing configuration for `US915` and `EU868`, the
configuration should look similar to the below:

```sh
{
  "id": <route id>,
  "net_id": "00003C",
  "oui": <oui>,
  "server": {
    "host": "",
    "port": 0,
    "protocol": {
      "type": "gwmp",
      "mapping": {
        "US915": 1701,
        "EU868": 1700
      }
    }
  },
  "max_copies": 15,
  "active": true,
  "locked": false,
  "ignore_empty_skf": false
}
```

## Add Device to ChirpStack

To add a device in Chirpstack, please follow the documentation in either of the guides below and
return here when complete.

- [Add Device to ChirpStack via Console](/iot/run-an-lns/chirpstack-add-device)
- [Add Device to ChirpStack via gRPC](/iot/run-an-lns/chirpstack-add-device-grpc)

## Configure Device in Helium Config Service

Now that the device is successfully created on ChirpStack, Helium Config Service needs to be
configured to know about the device. In doing so, the Helium Config Service CLI will be used to
associate the device EUIs and devArrs with the route.

### Add Device EUIs to Route

To add device EUIs to the route, run the `helium-config-service-cli route euis add` command. As
shown below, the command will perform a "dry run" if the `--commit` flag isn't provided.

In preparing the command, the `--route-id` flag corresponds to the id of the route created above,
the `--dev-eui` flag corresponds to the device EUI generated entered in ChirpStack, and the
`--app-eui` flag corresponds to the join EUI also entered in ChirpStack.

Please refer to the red-boxed portion of image below to find the device and join EUIs in ChirpStack.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    className="add-shadow add-shadow-margin add-border-radius"
    style={{ width: '100%', maxHeight: 'initial' }}
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/open-lns/chirpstack-device-and-join-eui.png')}
  />
  <figcaption>DevEUI and AppEUI displayed in ChirpStack</figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

```bash
helium-config-service-cli route euis add --route-id <route-id> --dev-eui <dev-eui> --app-eui <app-eui>
```

Once the result looks as desired, simply re-run the command with the ` --commit` to add the device
to the route.

### Add DevAddr to Route

To add DevAddrs to the route, run the `helium-config-service-cli route devaddrs add` command. As
shown below, the command will perform a "dry run" if the `--commit` flag isn't provided.

Here, the `--start-addr` and `--end-addr` values correspond to the results from the
`helium-config-service-cli org get --oui <OUI>` command described in detail in
[Gather Helium DevAddr Subnet Information for OUI](/iot/run-an-lns/configure-chirpstack#gather-helium-devaddr-subnet-information-for-oui)

```bash
helium-config-service-cli route devaddrs add --start-addr <start devAddr> --end-addr <end devAddr> --route-id <route-id>
```

Again, once the result looks as desired, simply re-run the command with the ` --commit` to add the
DevAddr to the route.

## Next Steps

You now have a fully functioning LNS on the Helium IoT network. For additional advanced
configurations, including automating the device addition process, please see
