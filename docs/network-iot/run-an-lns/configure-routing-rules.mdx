While Chirpstack is up and running for you, you need to let Config Service know of its existence.
First, let’s initialize some environment variables so that you don’t have to tell the CLI the same
thing over and over again:

Run `./main env init`

1.  Fill in `http://mainnet-config.helium.io:6080/` for `Config Service Host`
1.  Fill in the relative path of your delegate key pair file for `Keypair Location`
1.  Fill in `0x00003C` for `Net ID`
1.  Fill in your OUI for `Assigned OUI`
1.  Fill in the number of `multi-buy` you want for `Default Max Copies` as a default for your
    routes.
1.  Then export the environment variables. This needs to be done manually. You will see something
    like this and just add `export` to each line and run it. For instance, you would run export
    `HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15` variable. Do NOT put a space around the `=` sign

Now, you are ready to generate your first route. Routes contain the necessary information for us to
know how to route a packet — DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr range (for routing
uplinks), Endpoint (so we know where to send the packet to), etc.

1.  Run `./main route new --commit`
1.  You can then see the empty route template. It should look like this, except that you should be
    seeing your own Net ID, assigned OUI, max_copies in there:

    src={useBaseUrl('img/open-lns/roaming-setup-generate-route.png')}
    style={{ maxHeight: 350, minWidth: 0, flex: '1 1 auto' }}
  />

Next, let’s define the endpoint that you use for ingesting traffic. You can run:

```bash
$ ./main route update server --host <server ip> --port 1700 --route-id <route-id> --commit
```

Finally, let's make sure you specify the port for each LoRaWAN region you plan on supporting on your
Chirpstack. In our example, run

```bash
$ ./main route update add-gwmp-region —route-id <route-id> us915 1701 eu868 1700 --commit
```

### How to Add Your First Device

In this example, we will show you how to add an US915 OTAA Class A Device. On Chirpstack, navigate
to Device Profiles, and hit `Add device profile`. Name it something descriptive like
`US915 OTAA Class A`, and change the Region to US915 in the drop down. Leave everything else as
default.

The navigate to Applications, add an application if you don't have one yet. In that application, hit
`Add device`. Fill in the `Name`, `Device EUI` and select the device profile you just created.

Now that the device is successfully created on Chirpstack, you need to let Config Service know about
it, you need to run

```bash
$ ./main route euis add --route-id <route-id> -d <dev-eui> -a <app-eui> --commit
```

While this allows your device to join on the Helium Network, you also need to specify a DevAddr
range on that route so the device can also send uplink. It is recommended to set your route DevAddr
to be the devAddr slab of your OUI. Run

```bash
$ ./main route devaddrs add -s <start devAddr> -e <end devAddr> --route-id <route-id> -- commit
```

If you know all the possible EUIs ahead of time that you will use for your application, then you 
can add them all and not have to worry about it after that. If you don't then you'll have to add
them as you go. You can also learn how to automate it in the advanced section.

```bash

### Upcoming Tutorials

There will be an upcoming tutorial around session-key-filter (SKF).

The Config Service can be used to manage an OUI and devAddr. There are two ways to interact with the
Config Service:

1. Using the [Command-Line Interface ("CLI")](https://github.com/helium/helium-config-service-cli)
   detailed below.
2. Alternatively, you can also write scripts to interact with the Config Service directly through
   [GRPC APIs](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/service/iot_config.proto) for a more
   programmatic approach
