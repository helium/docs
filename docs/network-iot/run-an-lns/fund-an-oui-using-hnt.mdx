Funding an OUI with Data Credits requires HNT, as Data Credits can only be obtained using HNT. The
exchange rate for DC is $1 worth of HNT = 100,000 DC.

- If HNT is $2 then 0.5 HNT = 100,000 DC
- If HNT is $10 then 0.1 HNT = 100,000 DC

The USD/HNT exchange rate within the Helium Wallet App is used for the conversion and appears in the
Helium Wallet app before committing the transaction.

## Funding an OUI Using The CLI Wallet

The Helium CLI Wallet provides several tools to manage DC balances.

The `price` command is a helpful tool for determing the amount of HNT required for a particular
amount of DC. For example, this command will output the amount of HNT required to fund 1M DC ($10).

```sh
helium-wallet dc price 1000000
```

With HNT and Sol (for transaction fees) in an account, use the `mint` command to convert HNT into
DC. The `--dc` flag is a helpful way to mint a specific amount of DC. Mint these DC to an account
where further transactions can be issued on them â€” often the same account where they are being
minted from.

```sh
helium-wallet dc mint --payee <Account Address> --dc 1000000
```

After the DC is minted, it can be delegated to the OUI. The delegation is issued to the router key
of the OUI.

```sh
helium-wallet dc delegate iot <Router Key> 1000000 --commit
```

## Funding an OUI Using The Helium Wallet App

### Swap HNT to DC

1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.

The new DC balance amount can be verified in the app tokens list on the `$` tab within the Helium
Wallet app.
