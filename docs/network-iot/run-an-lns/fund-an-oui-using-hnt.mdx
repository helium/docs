Whether facilitated through a third party or acquired directly through the network, all data
transfer on Helium requires [Data Credits](/tokens/data-credit). This guide will illustrate two
methods of directly converting HNT into DC and subsequently delegating it for use by an OUI.

## Funding an OUI Using The CLI Wallet

The Helium CLI Wallet provides several tools to manage DC balances.

The `price` command is a helpful tool for determining the amount of HNT required for a particular
amount of DC. For example, this command will output the amount of HNT required to fund 1M DC ($10).

```sh
helium-wallet dc price 10
```

### Swap HNT to DC

With HNT and Sol (for transaction fees) in an account, use the `mint` command to convert HNT into
DC. The `--dc` flag is a helpful way to mint a specific amount of DC. Mint these DC to an account
where further transactions can be issued on them — often the same account where they are being
minted from.

```sh
helium-wallet dc mint --payee <Account Address> --dc 1000000 --commit
```

### Delegate DC To The OUI

After the DC is minted, it can be delegated to the OUI. The delegation is issued to the payer key of
the OUI.

```sh
helium-wallet dc delegate iot <Payer Key> 1000000 --commit
```

## Funding an OUI Using The Helium Wallet App

### Swap HNT to DC

1. Select a Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned for DC within the same Wallet.

The new DC balance amount can be verified in the app tokens list on the `$` tab within the Helium
Wallet app.

### Delegate DC To The OUI

1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the DC balance.
1. Tap `Delegate`.
1. Select the IOT Network.
1. Enter the payer key of the OUI as the address.
1. Enter the amount of DC to delegate.
1. Swipe to Delegate.

The OUI is now funded. It's now time to configure and deploy the LNS following the (Chirpstack
Configuration)[configure-chirpstack] guides.
