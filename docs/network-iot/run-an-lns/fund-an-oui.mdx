[Data Credits](/tokens/data-credit) are used to pay for all transmission of data from devices on the
Helium Network.

It is worth noting that HNT to DC conversion is irreversible. Data Credits cannot be refunded,
exchanged for other tokens, or transferred between wallets.

Several options are available for funding an OUI with Data Credits:

- [Fund an OUI using HNT with the Helium Wallet App](fund-an-oui-using-hnt)
- [Fund an OUI using a credit card with the Sphere Data Credit Portal](/tokens/data-credit-portal)

## Tracking OUI Balance

- Escrow Account
  - How to find

## Minimum Balance

The Helium Packet Router enforces a minimum balance of 35,000,000 Data Credits ($35). This minimum
balance is required to ensure that all Hotspots are compensated for their work on the network in the
case that the LNS transfers data more quickly than can be deducted from the OUI's balance. Token
balances cannot become negative, so this $35 buffer keeps network payments balanced.

If the DC balance of an OUI falls below the minimum balance, the LNS will be unable to recieve data
until the balance is increased.
