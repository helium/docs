Funding an OUI with Data Credits from HNT tokens can be performed with the Helium Wallet App or
through the [Sphere Data Credit Portal](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/data-credit-portal).

## Funding OUI with Data Credits

Funding an OUI with Data Credits requires HNT, as Data Credits can only be obtained using HNT. The
exchange rate for DC is $1 worth of HNT = 100,000 DC.

- If HNT is $2 then 0.5 HNT = 100,000 DC
- If HNT is $10 then 0.1 HNT = 100,000 DC

The USD/HNT exchange rate within the Helium Wallet App is used for the conversion and appears in the
Helium Wallet app before committing the transaction.

:::warning HNT to DC swaps are irreversible

Data Credits cannot be refunded, exchanged for other tokens, or transferred between wallets.

Always double-check the addresses before performing essential operations.

:::

### Swap HNT to DC within a Wallet:

1. Select a Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned for DC within the same Wallet.

The new DC balance amount can be verified in the app tokens list on the `$` tab within the Helium
Wallet app.

## Swap to Fund a Different Wallet

The Helium Wallet app can be used to swap HNT from one wallet to DC in another wallet.

This method requires that the sending Wallet is already funded with HNT to swap and SOL for
transaction fees.

Firstly add the Wallet address to the Address Book as a contact. This is the destination wallet that
you will send the DC to:

1. Tap the `Address Book` icon in the top right corner of the Helium Wallet app.
1. Add new contact with the Solana wallet address.

### Swap HNT to DC to send to a Wallet:

1. Select any Wallet in the Helium Wallet app.
1. Tap the `$` icon on the bottom tab bar.
1. Tap the `Swap` icon in the middle of the screen.
1. Select `HNT` in the top drop-down and enter an amount of HNT to swap.
1. The lower drop-down will be filled with the resulting DC amount.
1. **Tap the grey `Add Recipient +` text to enter the receiving Solana wallet address. This is the
   wallet address to send the DC to.**
1. Tap the `...` to the right of Solana Address and select the contact for the Wallet.
1. Tap the `Swap Tokens` button and confirm the swap transaction.
1. HNT is burned for DC within the same Wallet.

The new DC balance amount in the recipient Wallet can be verified by looking at the Helium Data
Credit token balance of the wallet on https://explorer.solana.com/

You now have a funded OUI, it's now time to configure and deploy your LNS
[here](configure-chirpstack).
