# Build a Packet Forwarder

:::warning

The ability to earn from [Proof of Coverage](/iot/proof-of-coverage) with anything other than a
[Full Hotspot](/network-iot/hotspots-iot/full-hotspots) is not supported.

Building your own packet forwarder enables Data transfer rewards _only_, **if and only if** you
complete the setup process [here](/iot/data-only-hotspots).

## Packet Forwarder Architecture

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/network-iot/setup-a-packet-forwarder/packet-forwarder-arch.png')} />

To be a Helium Hotspot, there are three principal components to know about:

- **Packet Forwarder**: this is a utility that interacts with the radio front-end and sends and
  receives raw radio packets with the Helium Miner.
- **Hotspot Client**: the Helium blockchain comes into the picture here; the hotspot client is
  responsible for routing packets to the appropriate Router entering into microtransactions brokered
  via gRPC.
- **Router**: a Helium compatible LoRaWAN Network Server ("LNS"); this component is interested in
  receiving the packets relating to its devices and handles downlink responses when appropriate.

Any device that can run an 8 channel LoRa front-end (such as SX1301 or SX1302) can be used to
participate in the Helium Network. The Hotspot Client is designed to send and receive packets using
the Semtech GateWay Messaging Protocol (GWMP), making it compatible with almost every LoRaWAN
Gateway on the Market.

Many off-the-shelf LoRaWAN Gateways work very well and using one of them gives you one less thing to
worry about as the Packet Forwarder is set up and ready to go.

This guide, however, is for those that want a more hands-on experience. We will essentially be
assembling a LoRaWAN Gateway with discrete parts, loading up an open-source Linux distribution,
compiling the Packet Forwarder, and running it all ourselves. In short, we'll be learning Gateways
that hard way!

### Example Custom Hardware

If you don’t have your own hardware yet, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4B running the latest
[64-bit RaspiOS](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/) image.

We recommend this configuration in particular if you are interested in running the Hotspot on the
Gateway itself; it's easy to run
[our Docker image from Quay](https://quay.io/repository/team-helium/miner) on a 64-bit ARM system.
If you choose to run the Hotspot elsewhere, it's possible to downgrade all the way to a Pi0, for
example, since you will only be running the Packet Forwarder on the Gateway.

RAKwireless sells multiple "PiHats" that provide the 8-channel front-end:

- [the RAK2287 (SX1302)](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2287-pi-hat)

Or you can check out their
[WisGate Developer](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-developer) line where they
provide bundles:

- the D4H/D4H+/D4HP are all based on the RAK2287

Ultimately, which configuration works for you depends on your situation, but all of them will work
with this guide with little adjustment.

### Preparing the SD Card

You can create an SD card from this image by looking for the recently inserted SD card in your
system.

```
$ ls -al /dev | grep sd
```

Generally, the timestamp is enough to indicate which device is the SD card. Next, write the image to
the SD card. For example:

```
dd if=~/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-arm64.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```

Use the command `sync` to make sure the filesystem is written before trying to remove the SD card.
Once the `sync` command returns, you can eject and remove the SD card from your system.

## Preparing RaspiOS

With a keyboard, mouse, and monitor plugged in, power on the Raspberry Pi. Proceed through the
guided RaspiOS setup where you will update your password, configure your Wi-Fi, etc.

Enable SPI and I2C using the raspi-config tool: `sudo raspi-config`

Select `Interface Options`, and enable `I2C` and `SPI` from within the menu system. This is also a
good time to enable SSH if you want it.

## Installing the Semtech Packet Forwarder

Depending on which SX130x radio you are running, you will want to select the appropriate Packet
Forwarder application.

#### Packet Forwarder SX1302

Pull down Helium's fork of the SX1302 Packet Forwarder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/helium/sx1302_hal.git
```

Go into the directory and build:

```bash
$ cd sx1302_hal
$ make
```

Next, go into the packet_forwarder directory, where we will create a link to the reset script:

```bash
$ cd packet_forwarder
$ ln -s ../tools/reset_lgw.sh reset_lgw.sh
```

We will also create a link to the appropriate regional configuration. For example:

```bash
$ ln -s global_conf.json.sx1250.US915 global_conf.json
```

We are now ready to test the start-up. From `~/sx1302_hal/packet_forwarder` try:

```bash
$ ./lora_pkt_fwd
```

If you get the following output, you are good to go:

```bash
INFO: [main] concentrator started, packet can now be received
INFO: concentrator EUI: 0x????????????????
```

You are now ready to set up the [Hotspot client](/iot/hotspots).
