## Introduction

The Helium Mobile Network is a decentralized
[carrier offload](https://blog.hellohelium.com/champions/) network. The Helium Mobile Hotspots and
Converted Wi-Fi Networks, while owned and deployed by the community, connect to a common core which
gives subscribers from various mobile carriers automatic access to the network. In return for the
work done by the radio deployer enabling this wireless coverage (securing real estate, providing
power, providing internet) the deployer is rewarded with [HNT tokens](/tokens/hnt-token).

## Hotspots

Helium Mobile Hotspots allow anyone to create Helium Network coverage. Helium Mobile Hotspots are
low cost, easy to deploy, Wi-Fi radios. These are best deployed in commercial locations where slow
moving people gather; think coffee shops, restaurants, shopping malls, public transit stations, etc.
In this way subscribers, business owners, and entrepreneurs can improve the mobile wireless user
experience rapidly where it's needed.

build coverage in your area!

[Converted Wi-Fi Networks](/mobile/data-only-mobile) are created when an existing
[Passpoint](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/passpoint) enabled Wi-Fi network is configured to
join the Helium Mobile Network. Through the Helium Plus program or
[self-serve guides](/mobile/data-only-mobile), owners of existing Wi-Fi networks can monetize their
asset by enabling carrier offload via the Helium Network. In return for servicing subscriber's
wireless data, the network owners gets rewarded with HNT tokens. Wi-Fi radios onboarded through
Helium Plus program do not earn Proof of Coverage (PoC) rewards.

your passpoint capable Wi-Fi network.

## Rewards

Hotspots can earn rewards for both Proof of Coverage and data transfer. PoC rewards
[are further defined here](/mobile/proof-of-coverage) and are dependent on the readiness and quality
of service provided by a radio. Data transfer rewards are awarded based on the amount of eligible
data passed through a Hotspot.

During the onboarding process, you will create or provide your Solana Wallet to be the "owner" of
your Hotspot. During this process an NFT will be created and transferred to your wallet to represent
your radio on the blockchain.  
HNT rewards will be credited to the Solana wallet that holds the NFT related to the Hotspot when the
Rewards Oracle disperses HNT Rewards.
