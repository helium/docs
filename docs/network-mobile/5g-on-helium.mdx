Historically many mobile networks are built top-down by service providers (e.g., AT&T and Verizon in
the United States). However, future networks will likely be a hybrid of large-scale operators and
people-owned 5G Hotspots due to consumer behavior demands (higher bandwidth and lower latency
requirements) and the physics of wireless radio, requiring denser networks with more nodes, further
increasing site acquisition costs.

The Helium model decentralizes these costs and enables communities to participate in building
reliable, high-bandwidth networks using technologies like [CBRS](/mobile/cbrs-radios) and Wi-Fi. We
see service providers as a critical component of this ecosystem rather than replacing service
providers altogether.

## Network of Networks

A general structure for onboarding new Decentralized Network Protocols (DNPs) to the broader Helium
Network was created with the passing of
[HIP-51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md). The Helium Mobile
DAO with 5G Hotspots is the first step in the evolution of the Helium ecosystem.

The passing of [HIP-51: Helium DAOs](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md)
additionally allows for the creation of MOBILE tokens that will reward 5G Hotspots with Small Cell
Radio(s) on the existing Helium Blockchain.

## How To Mine MOBILE

The Helium Network rewards 5G Hotspots with CBRS Radios ("Radios") and Wi-Fi Access Points ("Access
Points") for providing 5G wireless coverage and verifying the Helium Network with the Helium MOBILE
Token.

Mining MOBILE by providing 5G coverage requires a Wi-Fi Access Point or 5G Hotspot and one or more
compatible, online Radios. Radios must also be registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System)
maintained by the FCC.

Several factors contribute to the amount of MOBILE an Access Point or 5G Hotspot may earn over a
given period. This page covers some higher-level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in
mind that help better explain what you might earn and why.

:::info Where Do Rewards Go?

MOBILE PoC rewards will be credited to the Solana wallet that holds the NFT related to the Access
Point or 5G Hotspot when the Rewards Oracle disperses MOBILE PoC Rewards.

:::

Once properly deployed, Network Builders are not required to do anything else with your Access
Point, 5G Hotspot or Radios to earn MOBILE.

More than one Radio can be connected to a single 5G Hotspot to create a larger 5G coverage area,
with 5G Hotspots able to support as many Radios as would saturate their bandwidth. Note that
connecting more than one Radio may require an additional networking switch. Refer to the 5G Hotspot
Maker installation guides for specific instructions.

## Pre-Mine

As defined in [HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) and
[HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview), and
[approved by community-wide votes](https://heliumvote.com/14rifUhocpzdwsrWaG5PDbdREDkzyesKe1hXuWzibv8h9DdqKLe),
the Helium Foundation receives an allocation of 50B (billion) of 250B MOBILE tokens in the form of a
pre-mine.

### Genesis Period Rewards

The Helium Foundation will work with the core developers to initiate the Genesis period of MOBILE
rewards. 100M (million) tokens will be programmatically issued per day to all active Helium 5G
Hotspots during the Genesis period.

Details of the proportional mining rewards for active 5G Small Cell Radios
[can be found here.](/mobile/proof-of-coverage) Any MOBILE not mined during the Genesis period may
be reallocated to Grants and Operations.

### Grants and Operations

The Helium Foundation will distribute grants to teams making core contributions to the development
of the MOBILE subnetwork. Grants will be distributed based on defined deliverables and milestones.

The Nova Labs team will be the first grant recipient for work-in-progress and ongoing development
for the MOBILE subnetwork. This is spread across three deliverables with 5B MOBILE per milestone for
a total grant of 15B MOBILE:

- Milestone 1: Ability for 5G Hotspots to earn MOBILE (Started in August 2022)
- Milestone 2: Development and release of programmatic treasury (by October 2022)
  - Actual Programatic Minting started Feb 1 2023
  - The treasury started on April 19 2023
- Milestone 3: Proof-of-Coverage based rewards (December 2023)

The remaining 15B MOBILE is reserved for other work pertaining to Oracles and Mappers development or
other community contributions.

### Growth Activities Related to the MOBILE Subnetwork

Reserved for marketing and educational campaigns around the MOBILE subnetwork.

## Emissions Curve

HIP-53 defined a max supply of 250B (billion) MOBILE with issuance halvenings every two years
aligned with the HNT issuance halvenings. The first MOBILE halving will occur on August 1, 2023, to
align with HNT halving and will continue on a 2-year cycle afterward. Creating a "stub period" as
defined by [HIP-53: Mobile subnetwork](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md),
which will begin when standard emissions of MOBILE tokens begin (and MOBILE can be redeemed by HNT
in the subnetwork's treasury).

[HIP-75](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0075-mobile-poc-initiate-programmatic-minting-and-updated-emissions-curve.md#economic-changes-to-emissions-curve)
further modified the emission schedule and started the programatic minting of MOBILE on Feb
1st 2023.

implementing the HNT token treasury and redemption transactions on the Solana Blockchain as defined
for all new subnetworks in Phase 2 of
[HIP-51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md).

## Managing Tokens with the Helium Wallet App

A 5G Hotspot with an attached and properly registered Small Cell Radio will start earning MOBILE
automatically as one "lump sum" to the associated Hotspot. You can learn more about calculating
MOBILE Rewards in the [MOBILE Proof of Coverage](/mobile/proof-of-coverage) documentation.

Interacting with MOBILE tokens is only possible using the
[Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). Be sure to update the Helium Wallet app to the
latest version. More information can be found on the
[#announcements](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/730418759298318346) channel in
