The Helium Mobile Network uses "5G Hotspots" and Small Cell Radios to provide cellular coverage
using the Citizens Broadband Radio Service<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup> ("CBRS") frequencies.

[^1]:
    You can find more information about CBRS on the
    [Federal Communications Commission Website](https://www.fcc.gov/35-ghz-band-overview)

CBRS is a wide-broadcast 3.5Ghz band in the United States that does not require operators to acquire
spectrum licenses.

Only certified CBRS Radios provisioned with the FreedomFi firmware will operate when connected to a
5G Hotspot.

## Installation and Setup Guides

Instructions on installing a CBRS Small Cell Radio and registration with the SAS are provided by the
individual 5G Hotspot Makers.

For FreedomFi Gateways, refer to the installation guides here:

- [FreedomFi Indoor Install Guide](https://freedomfi.com/freedomfi-indoor-cbrs-small-cell-setup-guide/)
- [FreedomFi Outdoor Install Guide](https://freedomfi.com/freedomfi-outdoor-cbrs-small-cell-setup-guide/)

For Bobcat500 Gateways, refer to the Bobcat Knowledge Center:

- [Bobcat Knowledge Center CBRS Radio Troubleshooting Guide](https://bobcatminer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4588536001435-Overview)

:::warning

Misrepresentation of CBRS Radio installation information, including GPS location, height, antenna
orientation, or other characteristics in a SAS, violates FCC regulations and may result in fines and
possible criminal penalties.

## Access Gateway and Radio Dashboards

Mange and monitor the status of CBRS Small Cells through the Hotspot Cloud Dashboard at
[hotspots.hellohelium.com](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com)

<details>
<summary>Legacy Local Dashboard</summary>

:::warning Local Dashboard is being deprecated

The instructions below detail the legacy Local Dashboard available on FreedomFi and Bobber 5G
Hotspots.

The [Hotspot Cloud Dashboard](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com) should be used instead.

:::

Once the 5G Hotspot is onboarded and a Small Cell Radio installation is complete, the Small Cell
Radio will automatically initialize and acquire a GPS lock. Once that is complete, the Small Cell
Radio dashboard appears under the "Radio Dashboard" tab on the local IP address of the 5G Hotspot.

- If you are using a FreedomFi gateway, you can access the miner and radio dashboard via the URL:
  [http://freedomfi-gateway.local/](http://freedomfi-gateway.local/)

- If you are using a Bobber 500 gateway, you can access the miner and radio dashboard via this URL:
  [http://bobber-gateway.local/](http://bobber-gateway.local/)

## Outdoor Small Cell Radios

Outdoor Small Cell Radios are weatherized to endure the elements and are more powerful than Indoor
Small Cell Radios. However, Outdoor Small Cell Radios create a larger area of 5G coverage while
requiring more planning when installing and maintaining.

Outdoor Small Cell Radios require installation above ground level and require registration with the
Spectrum Access System (SAS) to operate. Please evaluate your site location and ability to install
these Small Cell Radios, and consider hiring a professional to ensure your installation is secure
and meets all regulatory requirements.

SAS registration is expected to be completed within five days of submission. Hotspot Owners will be
contacted via email with a confirmation of successful registration or with a rejection reply and an
explanation of what needs to be corrected.

## Indoor Small Cell Radios

Indoor Small Cell Radios are less powerful and are ideal for installations such as coffee shops,
bars, grocery stores, etc. Indoor Small Cell Radios are generally easier to install and create a
smaller, localized area of 5G coverage.

Indoor Small Cell Radios are physically smaller radios and can be installed at any height.
**Installing an Indoor Small Cell Radio outdoors is not recommended as they are not weather
resistant.**

## Using Multiple Small Cell Radios

A single 5G Hotspot can support multiple Small Cell Radios but requires an additional network
switch. A soft limit to consider is 7 Small Cell Radios to one 5G Hotspot; however, this limit is
only theoretical as the real limiting factor is bandwidth saturation. All 5G Hotspots are built with
a 1 Gbps Network Interface Card (NIC); the throughput of all the radios combined is limited to 1
Gbps or your internet speed, whichever is lower.

## Small Cell Radio GPS Requirement

All compatible CBRS Small Cell Radios use GPS for network timing data and to assert the Small Cell
Radio's location when requesting approval to transmit from the FCC-regulated Spectrum Access System
(SAS).

Small Cell Radios will need to be placed somewhere that allows the GPS antenna to be in a location
with good GPS reception (i.e., near a window). Indoor Small Cell Radios are shipped with an external
GPS antenna which can be positioned independently, while Outdoor Small Cell Radios have the GPS
antenna integrated into the body directly.

## Dynamic Protection Area Neighborhood Regions

Dynamic Protection Area<sup>(</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup> ("DPA") regions can be viewed on the map below.
Remember, these coordinates are not exact, and the affected areas for each DPA Activation event can
reach as far as 150km inland.
