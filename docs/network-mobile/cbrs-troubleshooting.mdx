## Spectrum Access `None` Status

A Dynamic Protection Area (DPA) is a geographic region where incumbents (Tier 1 users) get
protection from PAL and GAA interference.

During a DPA Activation event, all Small Cell Radios in the given DPA Neighborhood are disabled by
the SAS. There is nothing that you need or can do in these scenarios. The SAS will automatically
re-grant Spectrum Access once the DPA Activation event has concluded.

A message similar to the following may also be present:

> Spectrum Access status returned to "Connected" after it had been working. Wait and don't reboot.
> Suspension can last from hours to days for DPA Events. Contact support if you have been suspended
> for more than 48hrs. This is more prevalent if your location is within 150km of the DPA Regions.

## Spectrum Access `FAILURE` Status

This status is alarming, but do not let it scare you.

This "Failure" status is likely because the registration process has not been completed and
submitted to the SAS for newly installed Small Cell Radios.

You may see an information pop-up similar to this:

> SAS status code: 200 SAS response message: Response data: installationParam
