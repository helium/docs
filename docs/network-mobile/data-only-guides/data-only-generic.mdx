This guide provides a high-level, brand-agnostic walkthrough of how to set up Hotspot 2.0
(Passpoint) for Helium.

## Core Configuration Steps

While specific steps vary across vendors—Aruba, Cisco Meraki, Ruckus, Fortinet, Extreme, Ubiquiti,
etc.—the Hotspot 2.0 (Passpoint) setup follows the same general workflow:

1. Enable Hotspot 2.0 on your AP or controller.
2. Use WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise with 802.1X/EAP.
3. Provide the RadSec server details, certificates, and NAI Realms.
4. Allow traffic to relevant domains/IPs for RADIUS or certificate checks.
5. Confirm end-to-end connectivity and logs.

### 1. Hotspot 2.0 / Passpoint Enablement

1. **Enable the Feature**: Look for a toggle or option labeled "Hotspot 2.0," "Passpoint," or
   "HS2.0" on your AP or WLAN controller.
2. **NAI Realms**: For Helium Mobile, two realms must be configured:
   - `freedomfi.com` (EAP Method: `EAP-TLS`, Sub-Methods: `Certificate`)
   - `hellohelium.com` (EAP Method: `EAP-TLS`, Sub-Methods: `Certificate`)

### 2. SSID Profile

1. **Create a New SSID** (e.g., named `Helium`) or modify an existing one.
2. **Security**: Configure WPA3-Enterprise for 802.1X/EAP.
3. **Passpoint Advertising**: Under advanced or manual settings, enable Hotspot 2.0/Passpoint mode.
4. **Venue & Network Type**: Some platforms allow you to specify a venue name/type (e.g.,
   `Chargeable Public Network`).
5. **IP Address Type Availability**: If the controller supports it, set IPv4 to
   `Double NATed private IPv4` and IPv6 to `Unavailable`.
6. **Add Realms**: Input `freedomfi.com` and `hellohelium.com` with EAP Method `EAP-TLS` and
   Sub-Method `Certificate`.
7. **Domain List**: Include the domain names `freedomfi.com` and `hellohelium.com` in the domain
   list. If you have existing Passpoint configurations, you may use those domains.
8. **NAS-ID**: Enter the NAS-ID used during Helium Plus onboarding. Typically the MAC address of the
   network controller or an AP on the onboarded network.

### 3. AAA and RADIUS / RadSec Integration

Hotspot 2.0 deployments with Helium generally use RADIUS over TLS (RadSec) for secure
authentication.

1. **Create RADIUS Profile**:

RadSec (RADIUS over TLS) must be supported, or your network must have the ability to run a RadSec
proxy within it.

- Enable TLS and upload the **Client Certificate**, **Private Key**, and **CA Certificate** provided
  by the Helium Plus onboarding or your representative.
- Enter the **RadSec Servers** and shared secrets:
  - `52.37.147.195:2083` (Shared Secret: `radsec`)
  - `44.229.62.214:2083` (Shared Secret: `radsec`)
  - `44.241.107.197:2083` (Shared Secret: `radsec`)
- Enable **RADIUS Accounting** and configure the same servers.
  - `52.37.147.195:2083` (Shared Secret: `radsec`)
  - `44.229.62.214:2083` (Shared Secret: `radsec`)
  - `44.241.107.197:2083` (Shared Secret: `radsec`)
- Set an **Interim Update Interval** of 300 seconds.

### 4. Network & Firewall Rules

1. **Domains & Ports**: Whitelist or allow traffic to any AAA endpoints used by your network. RadSec
   uses TCP port `2083`.
2. **Walled Garden**: If your controller enforces pre-auth access, ensure Helium IP ranges are
   reachable during AAA transactions.

### 5. VLAN Assignments

1. **Designate VLAN**: Decide which VLAN or subnet handles Passpoint traffic. Provide DHCP, DNS, and
   other essential services.
2. **Isolation**: Follow best practices to segment Hotspot 2.0 traffic from internal resources.

### 6. Testing

1. **Client Device**: Use a smartphone or laptop known to support Hotspot 2.0. It should discover
   and automatically connect to your newly configured SSID.
2. **Logs & Controller**: Review logs for successful EAP authentication events.
3. **Connectivity**: Verify that a connected device obtains the expected IP address, can access the
   internet, and is properly accounted for in RADIUS logs.

## Best Practices

- **Keep AP Firmware Updated**: Use a version that fully supports Passpoint (HS2.0) features.
- **Segment Traffic**: A dedicated VLAN or subnet for Passpoint traffic enhances security.
- **Test Multiple OSes**: Different end-user devices can behave differently with Passpoint.
- **Monitor Logs**: Authentication or certificate issues typically appear in RADIUS or controller
  logs.
