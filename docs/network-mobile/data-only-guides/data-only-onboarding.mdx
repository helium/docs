Wi-Fi networks onboarded to Helium are eligible to earn HNT for handling carrier traffic.

At this time, only [Helium Mobile](https://hellohelium.com/) traffic is rewardable on networks
onboarded through self-serve tooling. If you are interested in handling other carrier traffic
through your commercial or other high-traffic deployment, please use the
[Helium Plus](https://www.helium.com/plus) program.

## Considerations for Entity Creation

Each Mobile network onboard will represent a single pin on the coverage map, regardless of how many
Hotspots (APs) it may contain. The entity representing this network will also hold any rewards
earned from data transfer until they are claimed. When considering entity creation, try to constrain
the scope of the onboarded deployment to the size of one building or smaller.

Self-serve onboards will be counted as a single Hotspot in Helium Network metrics. Networks
onboarded through the Helium Plus program carry additional metadata which represents the total
number of Hotspots in a given deployment. For large network deployments, please use the Helium Plus
program.

## Prepare Wallet

Download and configure the [Helium Wallet CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet) with a new or existing Solana
account. The following steps require Helium Wallet CLI `2.1.1` or newer.

Onboarding a new Wi-Fi Network requires a token fee per network or location. Ensure the account has
these minimum balances.

| Token                               | Amount          |                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [Data Credits](/tokens/data-credit) | 100,000 ($1.00) | Mobile entity onboarding cost.               |
| [MOBILE](/tokens/mobile-token)      | $1.00           | Mobile entity onboarding cost.               |
| [SOL](/tokens/sol-token)            | ~0.005          | Solana blockchain fees and NFT creation.[^1] |

    _At the time of writing, onboarding required 0.003778 SOL; however, the fee will fluctuate based
    on network conditions._

## Create and Onboard Data-Only Hotspot

The process for creating a Data-Only Hotspot begins by generating the Hotspot key and then creating
and onboarding the Rewardable Entity NFT using the Helium Wallet CLI.

Create the Hotspot key by creating an onboarding token:

```sh title="Generate an onboarding token."
helium-wallet hotspots add mobile token
```

The `token` command will return a response looking like this:

```json title="Example generated entity and token."
{
  "hotspot": {
    "key": "14WaYzPtgvs3sranGNBxTSj9d4f36J6c6mjRWKqRwDr8NirmrmL",
    "name": "recumbent-menthol-porcupine"
  },
  "token": "CmUSIQHOP/T3SOWXnjrAZXyJ5CWmQChywBmpyigcLjNVr+nMJSONJexLDs1m61BLVetCqcXla0DmOWZVUORYBn4ya9gv0jy8pz8Av4JgnZzrJlp/9bskEZ4lIYjQVObuwh+54DlTAQ=="
}
```

Onboard the created Hotspot using the given token:

Use the "token" value along with the Hotspot's physical latitude and longitude to assert its
location to the network. A utility such as [https://www.latlong.net/](latlong.net) is helpful for
looking up coordinates.

```sh title="Onboard the Rewardable Entity (Hotspot)"
helium-wallet hotspots add mobile onboard <TOKEN> --lat=37.779930 --lon=-122.387906 --commit
```

Here, `<TOKEN>` represents the token generated in step 1. The command prompts for the CLI wallet
password, signs the transaction, and submits it to the blockchain. A result will print as a
successful transaction hash.

If any errors are returned during the onboarding, double check token balances and retry the
onboarding transaction.

## Hotspot RADIUS Certificates

The last step is to create the certificates for the Hotspot. Certificates are created uniquely for
each onboard.

```sh
helium-wallet hotspots add mobile cert <HOTSPOT_KEY> --nas-id xx:xx:xx:xx:xx --address "South Beach Yacht Club, 899 2nd St, San Francisco, CA 94107"
```

`<HOTSPOT_KEY>` is the key from first step (e.g. `14Wa...mrmL`).

`--nas-id` must match the NAS-ID being broadcast from the SSID. Use a MAC address from the onboarded
network as the NAS-ID.

`--address` should best represent the installed location of the network. If a business, include the
business name. If residential, a street address is sufficient.

This command will create the Hotspot certs and save them in the active directory.

```json title="Certificate response delivered from the CLI command."
{
  "expiration": "2028-02-21T23:10:51Z",
  "private_key": "14WaYzPtgvs3sranGNBxTSj9d4f36J6c6mjRWKqRwDr8NirmrmL.pk",
  "certificate": "14WaYzPtgvs3sranGNBxTSj9d4f36J6c6mjRWKqRwDr8NirmrmL.cer",
  "ca_chain": "data-only.ca"
}
```

When the `cert` command is executed with both the NAS-ID and address, any existing certificates for
the specified Hotspot are retrieved. Should certificate files already exist in the active directory,
the command returns an error; the `--force` flag may be used to overwrite existing files.
