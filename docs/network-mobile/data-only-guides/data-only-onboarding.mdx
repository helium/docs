Networks onboarded to Helium are eligible to earn HNT for handling carrier traffic. At this time,
only Helium Mobile traffic is rewardable on Wi-Fi radio networks onboarded through this page. If you
are interested in handling other carrier traffic through your commercial or other high-traffic
venue, please leverage the [Helium Plus](https://www.helium.com/plus) program.

1. Create and onboard the Rewardable Entity NFT
2. Get the Passpoint Certificate and private key for the created rewardable entity

Download and configure the [Helium Wallet CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet) with a new Solana account or an
existing account you own. The following steps require release candidate `2.0.2.rc1` or newer.

## Create and onboard data-only Hotspot

To create a Data-Only Hotspot we need to create the Hotspot key and then create and onboard the
Rewardable Entity NFT.

- Create the Hotspot key by creating an onboarding token

```sh title="Create an onboarding token."
helium-wallet --url d hotspots add mobile token
```

which will return a response looking like this:

```json
{
  "hotspot": {
    "key": "14WaYzPtgvs3sranGNBxTSj9d4f36J6c6mjRWKqRwDr8NirmrmL",
    "name": "recumbent-menthol-porcupine"
  },
  "token": "CmUSIQHOP/T3SOWXnjrAZXyJ5CWmQChywBmpyigcLjNVr+nMJSONJexLDs1m61BLVetCqcXla0DmOWZVUORYBn4ya9gv0jy8pz8Av4JgnZzrJlp/9bskEZ4lIYjQVObuwh+54DlTAQ=="
}
```

The token represents the onboarding token for the Hotspot with the displayed new Hotspot public key
and name.

- Onboard the created Hotspot using the given token

```sh title="Onboard the Rewardable Entity (Hotspot)"
helium-wallet --url d hotspots add mobile onboard <TOKEN> --commit
```

where `<TOKEN>` is the value of the issued token in step 1 This will request the cli wallet password
sign the transaction and submit it to the blockchain. A result will print a successful transaction
hash.

Note that you can also pass in lat/lon information to the onboard command which puts the Hotspot
location on chain. This is is recommended practice.

## Get Cert for data-only Hotspot

The last step is to create the certificate for the Hotspot.

- Create a json file called something like “location.json” and edit it to include details around the
  NAS-ID, address and lat/lon of the Hotspot.

```sh title="Create and open location.json"
touch location.json && nano location.json
```

```json title="Enter the information about your network."
{
  "address": "Wi-Fi Network Location",
  "lat": 12.0878587,
  "lon": -68.8808494,
  "nas_id": "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
}
```

- Then get the certificate using

`helium-wallet --url d hotspots add mobile cert <HOTSPOT> <INFO> --commit`

Where `<HOTSPOT>` is the key from the issued token in the creation steps, and `<INFO>` is the
filename in the json file created above. This will get and create the Hotspot cert and save the cert
in `<HOTSPOT>.cer` and the private key in `<HOTSPOT>.pk.`

Note that the `--url d` is required for all wallet commands since this is not deployed on mainnet
yet.
