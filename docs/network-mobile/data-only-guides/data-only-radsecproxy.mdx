# RadSecProxy

radsecproxy is a generic open source RADIUS proxy that in addition to usual RADIUS UDP transport,
also supports TLS (RadSec)

The project can be found at [https://radsecproxy.github.io/](https://radsecproxy.github.io/)

Helium makes a preconfigured and containerized version of this project available at
[https://github.com/helium/radsec-proxy](https://github.com/helium/radsec-proxy)

## Hardware Requirements

RadSecProxy is designed to be lightweight at not require many hardware resources as it scales. Below
are suggested hardware specs that will support small (10's of WiFi APs) to medium (up to 1000 APs)
deployments.

- Quad core CPU e.g. Intel i5 or better
- 2 GB RAM minimum, 4GB for bigger deployments
- 1.25 GB free disk space
- Docker supporting OS (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
- 1 Gbps Ethernet port
- RadSecProxy typically uses ports 2083 and 443 for RadSec communication.
- Ensure these ports are open and accessible outbound from the proxy.
- If using RADIUS/TLS, also ensure ports 1812 (UDP/TCP) and 1813 (UDP for accounting) are open.

# Local Deployment Options

The typical deployment used by converted Helium networks is to deploy an instance of RadSecProxy
locally within the deployer controlled network. This can take two forms depending on the how the
deployer controlled network is structured.

## Secured Remote Sites - Local

      'img/mobile-data-only/radsecproxy/Helium RADIUS Options-Secure Sites Single RSP.png',
    )}
    style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />

In this deployment model the Deployer has existing secure links between it's remote sites and a
central office where common infrastructure is housed. In this case, the RADIUS from WiFi APs at the
remote sites is secured back to central office where an instance of RadSecProxy can be deployed.
This one instance of RadSecProxy can then be used by all the APs in remote sites 1 - 4.

## Unsecured Remote Sites - Local

      'img/mobile-data-only/radsecproxy/Helium RADIUS Options-Independent sites many RSPs.png',
    )}
    style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />

In this deployment model the Deployer has multiple remote sites, each of which are connected
directly to the internet with no secure link back to a central office location. In this scenario an
instance of RadSecProxy can be deployed locally at each site to securely proxy RADIUS traffic to
Helium over the open internet.

# Cloud Deployment Options

If the deployer is unable to deploy an instance of RadSecProxy locally using the options above,
another option is to purchase access to a cloud instance of RadSecProxy hosted by Helium. In this
deployment model each deployer site must be connected via IPsec VPN to the count instance to ensure
safe transport of unencrypted RADIUS to the proxy.

## Secured Remote Sites - VPN

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl(
      'img/mobile-data-only/radsecproxy/Helium RADIUS Options-Secure Sites Single VPN.png',
    )}
    style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />

In this deployment model the Deployer has existing secure links between it's remote sites and a
central office where common infrastructure is housed. However the deployer is unable to deploy a
local instance of RadSecProxy. Instead the Deployer can purchase access to a cloud hosted instance
of RadSecProxy managed by Helium. The deploy then establishes an IPsec based VPN link to the cloud
RadSecProxy.

## Unsecured Remote Sites - VPN

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl(
      'img/mobile-data-only/radsecproxy/Helium RADIUS Options-Independent sites many VPNs.png',
    )}
    style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />

In this deployment model the Deployer has multiple remote sites, each of which are connected
directly to the internet with no secure link back to a central office location. In this scenario the
deployer can purchase access to a cloud hosted instance of RadSecProxy managed by Helium. Each site
is then connected to the cloud instance using an IPsec VPN to secure the link.
