The Bring Your Own Fleet process activates Passpoint-enabled hardware for cellular network data
transfer on Helium. In the cellular industry, these are known as 'Brownfield' deployments – where
existing hardware is configured to operate a new network. These onboarded fleets are represented
through an on-chain rewardable entity.

Converting existing networks into Helium-compatible Hotspots benefits both network users and venue
owners. Venue owners can extend Helium's Mobile coverage, appealing to users and carriers. The
Passpoint specification ensures users connect automatically without re-authentication, providing
uninterrupted connectivity. Data transferred through these deployments are also eligible for network
rewards, as they can offload data traffic for carriers.

Using existing infrastructure reduces costs, making it a practical solution for venue owners. When
deciding between deploying a new Hotspot (Greenfield) or converting an existing network, consider
Proof of Coverage rewards, deployment costs, and coverage needs. New Hotspots earn Proof of Coverage
rewards and require new hardware, while existing networks have lower setup costs and can quickly
increase coverage. Both options can complement each other in the Helium Mobile network.

## Getting Started

If you have compatible network, integrating it with Helium Mobile is simple. Start by reviewing the
manufacturer-specific guides:

## Deployment Requirements

Existing Wi-Fi networks must have Passpoint-enabled access points, which are typically supported by
manufacturers like Ubiquiti, Cisco, and Aruba. Additionally, these access points need to integrate
with the Helium MOBILE Network to handle traffic and qualify for data transfer rewards. This
integration involves network-level configurations for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

### Enterprise Network Considerations

Fleets are characterized by Helium with a public on-chain key which is paired with the RADIUS
certificates. The network expects each pubkey/cert pair to be attached to a single NAS-ID. If a
single NAS-ID is shared among multiple locations, the 'Brownfield Inventory System' disambiguates
multiple locations for the purposes of coverage availability representation.
