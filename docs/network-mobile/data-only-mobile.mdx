The network conversion process activates Passpoint-enabled hardware for cellular network data
transfer on Helium. In the cellular industry, these are known as 'Brownfield' deployments – where
existing hardware is configured to operate a new network. Converted networks continue to work with
existing SSIDs. The Helium Network configurations are additive to other configurations and do not
impact existing network function.

Using existing infrastructure reduces costs, making it a practical solution for venue owners. When
deciding between deploying a new Hotspot (Greenfield) or converting an existing network, consider
Proof of Coverage rewards, deployment costs, and coverage needs. Both options can complement each
other in the Helium Mobile network.

## Getting Started

For compatible networks, integrating with Helium Mobile is simple. Start by reviewing the
manufacturer-specific guides:

- [Aruba Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-aruba)
- [Juniper Mist Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-juniper-mist)
- [Meraki Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-meraki)
- [Ruckus Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-ruckus)
- [Ubiquiti Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-ubiquiti)

Or refer to the generic deployment reference for guidance with other manufacturers:

- [General Conversion Guide](/mobile/data-only-generic)

## Deployment Requirements

Existing WiFi networks must have Passpoint-enabled access points, which are typically supported by
manufacturers like Ubiquiti, Cisco, and Aruba. Additionally, these access points need to integrate
with the Helium MOBILE Network to handle traffic and qualify for data transfer rewards. This
integration involves network-level configurations for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

### Enterprise Network Considerations

Fleets are characterized on Helium with a public on-chain key which is paired with the RADIUS
certificates. The entities created from the self-serve tooling expect each pubkey/cert pair to be
attached to a single NAS-ID. Via the [Helium Plus](http://helium.com/plus) program, multiple NAS-IDs
may be onboarded to a single certificate set.
