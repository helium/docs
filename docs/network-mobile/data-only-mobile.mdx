The 'Bring Your Own Fleet' process activates Passpoint-enabled hardware for cellular network data
transfer on Helium. These onboarded fleets are represented through an on-chain rewardable entity.

## What is Passpoint?

Passpoint is a Wi-Fi Alliance protocol designed to streamline and secure Wi-Fi access. With
Passpoint, users don't need to manually find and authenticate networks. When a user's device is
provisioned to access a Passpoint-enabled network, it will automatically connect to that network
without manual intervention.

Furthermore, the protocol enables precise traffic accounting, perfectly aligning with the needs of
carrier networks.

## Why Bring Your Own Fleet?

Converting existing networks into Helium-compatible Hotspots benefits both network users and venue
owners. Venue owners can extend Helium Mobile's coverage, appealing to users and carriers. Passpoint
technology ensures users connect automatically without re-authentication, providing uninterrupted
connectivity. Data transferred through the network is also eligible for network rewards, and
Passpoint-enabled Hotspots can offload data traffic. This creates revenue for owners and helps
carriers manage congestion.

Using existing infrastructure reduces costs, making it a practical solution for venue owners. When
deciding between deploying a new Hotspot (Greenfield) or converting an existing network, consider
Proof of Coverage rewards, deployment costs, and coverage needs. New Hotspots earn Proof of Coverage
rewards and require new hardware, while existing networks have lower setup costs and can quickly
increase coverage. Both options can complement each other in the Helium Mobile network.

## Deployment Requirements

Existing Wi-Fi networks must have Passpoint-enabled access points, which are typically supported by
manufacturers like Ubiquiti, Cisco, and Aruba. Additionally, these access points need to integrate
with the Helium MOBILE Network to handle traffic and qualify for data transfer rewards. This
integration involves network-level configurations for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

### Enterprise Network Considerations

Fleets are characterized by Helium as a public key on-chain which is paired with the RADIUS
certificates. The network expects each pubkey/cert pair to be attached to a single NAS-ID. If a
single NAS-ID is shared among multiple locations, the 'Brownfield Inventory System' disambiguates
multiple locations for the purposes of coverage availability representation.

## Getting Started

If you have a Passpoint-enabled network, integrating it with Helium Mobile is simple. Start by
reviewing the manufacturer-specific guides:
