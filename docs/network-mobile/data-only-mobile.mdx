The network conversion process activates Passpoint-enabled hardware for cellular network data
transfer on Helium. In the cellular industry, these are known as 'Brownfield' deployments – where
existing hardware is configured to operate a new network. Converted networks continue to work with
existing SSIDs. The Helium Network configurations are additive to other configurations and do not
impact existing network function.

Using existing infrastructure reduces costs, making it a practical solution for venue owners. When
deciding between deploying a new Hotspot (Greenfield) or converting an existing network, consider
Proof of Coverage rewards, deployment costs, and coverage needs. Both options can complement each
other in the Helium Mobile network.

## Getting Started

For compatible networks, integrating with Helium Mobile is simple. Start by reviewing the
manufacturer-specific guides:

- [Aruba Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-aruba)
- [Juniper Mist Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-juniper-mist)
- [Meraki Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-meraki)
- [MikroTik Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-mikrotik)
- [Ruckus Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-ruckus)
- [Ubiquiti Onboarding Guide](/mobile/data-only-ubiquiti)

Or refer to the generic deployment reference for guidance with other manufacturers:

## Deployment Requirements

Existing WiFi networks must have Passpoint-enabled access points, which are typically supported by
manufacturers like Ubiquiti, Cisco, and Aruba. Additionally, these access points need to integrate
with the Helium MOBILE Network to handle traffic and qualify for data transfer rewards. This
integration involves network-level configurations for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

### Enterprise Network Considerations

Fleets are characterized on Helium with a public on-chain key which is paired with the RADIUS
certificates. The entities created from the self-serve tooling expect each pubkey/cert pair to be
attached to a single NAS-ID. Via the [Helium Plus](http://helium.com/plus) program, multiple NAS-IDs
may be onboarded to a single certificate set.

### RadSecProxy Deployment options

RADIUS is a UDP protocol meant for use inside an operators secure network. RADIUS in standard form
is not meant to traverse the open internet as this would expose private user identity data to the
open internet. To address this the industry created a RADIUS over TLS protocol called RadSec. Using
RadSec RADIUS contents are encrypted and packaged into a TCP session which makes it suitable to
traverse the open internet safely.

If your Wi-Fi OEM does not natively support RadSec in the network you want to convert, deployers
must choose one of two main options:

- Deploy local RadSecProxy within the deployer controlled secure domain
- Establish a secure IPsec VPN to the Helium hosted cloud RadSecProxy instance
