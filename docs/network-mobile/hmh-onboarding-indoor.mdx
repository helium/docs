# Helium Mobile Hotspot Indoor Setup Guide

This guide will take you through the process of setting up your Helium Mobile Hotspot Indoor. Please
follow the setup steps carefully and report any problems to our support team.

:::note Recommendation

Open this guide on a computer or tablet or print it out instead of following it on the smartphone
that will be used to run the app and register the Helium Mobile Hotspot.

:::

## Initial Setup

For the setup process, place the Helium Mobile Hotspot near your router and set it up where it’s
easily accessible. This validates that things are working before the Hotspot is mounted to its
permanent location, which may be difficult to access.

Mounting tips and instructions will be covered in Step 9.

### Setup Requirements

- iPhone with **iOS 14.0** and up, or Android smartphone with **Android 11** and up
- Wired Broadband Connection

## Step 1. Unbox the Helium Mobile Hotspot

Connect the Ethernet cord:

1. Attach one end to a LAN port on your router.
2. Attach the other end to the Helium Mobile Hotspot Ethernet port closest to the Power connector.
   _Note: the other network port is covered and should not be used._

Connect the power cord to the power port.

## Step 2. Firmware Update

Your Helium Mobile Hotspot will need the latest firmware update before you set it up.

This process is automatic and will take about 3 minutes. During onboarding, the LEDs in front of the
Hotspot will cycle. You can tell that the firmware update is complete if the 4 lights on the Hotspot
are solid/flashing and stay that way.

_Please ensure that all four lights are either on or blinking green before moving to the next step._

## Step 3. Download and Install the Helium Mobile Builder App

Download the Helium Mobile Builder App:

- **Android:**
  [Download Helium Mobile Builder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hellohelium.builder)
- **iOS:**
  [Download Helium Mobile Builder](https://apps.apple.com/app/helium-mobile-builder/id123456789)

## Step 4. Log in to Helium Mobile Builder App

**Click Begin** to log in or sign up for a Helium Mobile account.

- If you are a subscriber to the Helium Mobile cellular service, you already have a Helium Mobile
  account and can use it to sign in to the Builder app.
- If you’re new to the Helium Mobile ecosystem, please create a Helium Mobile account. In addition
  to the Builder app, it provides seamless access to various builder tools like the
  [Helium Mobile Hotspots Dashboard](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com) and the
  [Helium Mobile Coverage Planner](https://planner.hellohelium.com).

_Alternatively, you can log in with the [Helium Wallet](https://docs.helium.com). This option is
more suitable for advanced users, and we generally recommend using a Helium Mobile account instead._

## Step 5. Set Your Hotspot's Location

**When prompted, allow the Helium Mobile Builder App to use your phone’s location to determine the
location of the Hotspot.**

Once the location is determined, you will be able to edit it or choose the location reported by your
phone to proceed to the next step.

## Step 6. Connect to the Hotspot

**Please make sure you have Wi-Fi enabled on your phone before proceeding.**

When prompted, **allow the Helium Mobile Builder App** to use the camera and scan the QR code on the
box or back of the Hotspot.

Alternatively, you can enter the Hotspot’s network credentials manually, located on the QR code
sticker. **The network name and password are only necessary during this onboarding process.**

_If you are unable to connect to the Hotspot’s network, please make sure your phone is in the direct
line of sight of the Hotspot._

## Step 7. Register the Hotspot

**Verify that the information about your Hotspot is correct before proceeding to the final
registration step.**

:::warning 10 Minutes

The registration process can take up to 10 minutes.

:::

## Step 8. View Your Helium Mobile Hotspot

See all your Hotspots in the Fleet tab. Your newly deployed Hotspot will be indicated with a blue
dot.

:::warning 10 Minutes

It can take up to 10 minutes for your new Hotspot to appear in the list.

It can take up to 48 hours for the Hotspot to start earning HNT rewards and appear on the
[Helium Mobile Coverage Planner](https://planner.hellohelium.com).

## Step 9. Mounting the Hotspot

Now that your Hotspot is fully set up and configured, find a place where it can provide the best
coverage. Here are some tips and best practices:

- **Face Users**

  - Hotspots create coverage from their front disc. Objects composed of metal and water may block or
    reflect signals, but the signals can pass through glass if covering outdoor areas.

- **Line-of-Sight**

  - Ceiling-mounted Hotspots usually have far fewer obstructions and a clearer line-of-sight,
    providing faster speeds.

/>

- **Use the Mount**

  - Need to mount on a flat surface? Use the included mount to allow you to direct your signal
    towards its users.

## Step 10. Testing Connectivity

**Helium Mobile cellular service subscribers with the Dynamic Coverage certificate can connect to
the Helium Mobile Hotspot when in range.**

Please allow at least three minutes after successful Hotspot registration for the device to be ready
to start broadcasting the “Helium” Wi-Fi network.

- Disconnect and disable auto-join to any Wi-Fi network in the same area.
- Do not use the password provided on the box or back of the Hotspot to connect to the Helium
  network. It should be used only during the Hotspot onboarding.
- Your phone should automatically join the Helium network. If this doesn’t happen automatically,
  please reinstall the Helium Mobile app.
