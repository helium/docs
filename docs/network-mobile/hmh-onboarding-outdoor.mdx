# Helium Mobile Hotspot Outdoor Setup Guide

This guide will take you through the process of setting up your Helium Mobile Hotspot Outdoor.
Please follow the setup steps carefully and report any problems to our support team.

:::note Recommendation

Open this guide on a computer or tablet or print it out instead of following it on the smartphone
that will be used to run the app and register the Helium Mobile Hotspot.

:::

## Setup Requirements

- iPhone with **iOS 14.0** and up, or Android smartphone with **Android 11** and up
- Wired broadband connection
- Outdoor Cat6 Ethernet cable up to 300ft
- Indoor PoE injector
- Regular Ethernet cable to connect to your router
- Mounting pole, depending on the installation location

## What’s in the Box?

- Outdoor Helium Mobile Hotspot
- Mounting brackets and screws

## Step 1. Unbox the Helium Mobile Hotspot Outdoor

**The Hotspot’s box has a QR code and network credential necessary to connect to the Hotspot during
later setup steps.**

_We recommend that you save the box or take a picture of the QR code. The QR code is also available
on the back of the Hotspot; however, it might be hard to access it after the Hotspot is installed at
its final location._

## Step 2. Power up your Hotspot

- **Connect one end of the outdoor Cat6 cable to the Hotspot and the other end to the PoE port of
  the PoE injector.**
- **Connect one end of the Ethernet cable to an available LAN port on your Wi-Fi router, and the
  other end to the LAN port of the PoE injector.**

_If everything is connected properly, the light indicator on the Hotspot will turn solid blue._

## Step 3. Firmware Upgrade

**The Helium Mobile Hotspot may need to be updated to the latest firmware.**

_This process is automatic and will take a few minutes. During the upgrade, the LED light will turn
from solid blue to blinking blue._

After the update is complete, the LED light will turn off, indicating an automatic reboot of the
Hotspot. Once the reboot is complete, the LED light will turn blinking blue followed by a solid
blue, which indicates that the Hotspot is ready to operate.

:::warning Check the Light!

Please ensure that the LED light is solid blue before moving to the next step.

## Step 4. Mounting the Hotspot

Follow these mounting tips to install your Hotspot:

- **Face your Users**

  - Hotspots create coverage from their front face. Signals can pass through glass, but trees,
    buildings, and other objects may block or reflect them.

- **Place it High**

  - Mount your Hotspot higher to avoid signal loss from structures like trees or buildings. Remember
    to tilt it down the higher you place it.

- **Use the Mount**

  - Mount your Hotspot on a pole. Use the included mount to allow you to direct your signal towards
    its users.

## Step 5. Download and Install the Helium Mobile Builder App

Download the Helium Mobile Builder App:

- **Android:**
  [Download Helium Mobile Builder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hellohelium.builder)
- **iOS:**
  [Download Helium Mobile Builder](https://apps.apple.com/app/helium-mobile-builder/id123456789)

## Step 6. Log in to Helium Mobile Builder App

Click **Begin** to log in or sign up for a Helium Mobile account.

- If you are a subscriber to the Helium Mobile cellular service, you already have a Helium Mobile
  account and can use it to sign in to the Builder app.
- If you’re new to the Helium Mobile ecosystem, please create a Helium Mobile account. In addition
  to the Builder app, it provides seamless access to various builder tools like the
  [Helium Mobile Hotspots Dashboard](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com) and the
  [Helium Mobile Coverage Planner](https://planner.hellohelium.com).

_Alternatively, you can log in with the [Helium Wallet](https://docs.helium.com). This option is
more suitable for advanced users, and we generally recommend using a Helium Mobile account instead._

## Step 7. Connect to the Hotspot

**Please make sure you have Wi-Fi enabled on your phone before proceeding with this step.**

When prompted, **allow the Helium Mobile Builder App** to use the camera and scan the QR code on the
box or back of the Hotspot.

Alternatively, you can enter the Hotspot’s network credential manually, located on the QR code
sticker. **The network name and password are only necessary during the onboarding process.**

If you are unable to connect to the Hotspot’s network, please make sure your phone is in the direct
line of sight of the Hotspot.

## Step 8. Confirm Location of the Installation

**Once the GPS lock is acquired successfully, you will be able to see the location of your Hotspot
on the next screen.**

Make sure the data is accurate and retry if needed.

## Step 9. Set Height of the Hotspot

Measure the above-ground height of your installation. **Must be between 1 and 1000 ft.**

## Step 10. Set Direction of Hotspot

**Hotspots provide coverage from their front face.**

When measuring directionality, aim your phone in the same direction as the front of your Hotspot is
pointing.

## Step 11. Register the Hotspot

**Verify that the information about your Hotspot is correct before proceeding to the final
registration step.**

The registration process can take up to 10 minutes.

## Step 12. View your Helium Mobile Hotspot

The **Fleet** tab displays your Hotspots. Your newly deployed Hotspot should be indicated with a
blue dot.

:::warning 10 minutes

It might take up to 10 minutes for the Hotspot to appear in the list.

:::

Additionally, it might take up to 48 hours for the Hotspot to start earning HNT rewards and appear
on the Helium Mobile Coverage Planner.

## Step 13. Testing Connectivity

**Helium Mobile cellular service subscribers with Dynamic Coverage Enhanced activated on their
devices can connect to the Helium Mobile Hotspot when in range.**

Please allow at least three minutes after successful Hotspot registration for the device to be ready
to start broadcasting the “Helium” Wi-Fi network.

- Disconnect and disable auto-join to any Wi-Fi network in the same area.
- **Do not** use the password provided on the box or back of the Hotspot to connect to the Helium
  Mobile network. It should be used only during the Hotspot onboarding.
- Your phone should automatically join the Helium Mobile network. If this doesn’t happen
  automatically, please reinstall the Helium Mobile app.
