The Helium Network rewards 5G Hotspots with CBRS Radios ("Radios") for providing 5G wireless
coverage and verifying the Helium Network with the Helium MOBILE Token.

Mining MOBILE by providing 5G coverage requires a 5G Hotspot and one or more compatible, online
Radios. Radios must also be registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System) maintained by the FCC.

Several factors contribute to the amount of MOBILE a 5G Hotspot may earn over a given period. This
page covers some higher-level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that help better
explain what you might earn and why.

## Rewards

MOBILE PoC rewards will be credited to the Solana NFT that owns the 5G Hotspot a given Radio is
connected to when the Rewards Oracle disperses MOBILE PoC Rewards.

A 5G Hotspot with an attached and properly registered Small Cell Radio will start earning MOBILE
automatically as one "lump sum" to the associated Hotspot. You can learn more about calculating
MOBILE Rewards in the [MOBILE Proof of Coverage](/mobile/proof-of-coverage) documentation.

Once properly deployed, Network Builders are not required to do anything else with your 5G Hotspot
or Radios to earn MOBILE.

More than one Radio can be connected to a single 5G Hotspot to create a larger 5G coverage area,
with 5G Hotspots able to support as many Radios as would saturate their bandwidth. Note that
connecting more than one Radio may require an additional networking switch. Refer to the 5G Hotspot
Maker installation guides for specific instructions.
