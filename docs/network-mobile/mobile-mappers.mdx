:::tip Coming Soon

The details on how data from Mobile Mappers will be used in rewards calculations have yet to be
developed, with no estimated completion date.

:::

Mobile Mappers are hardware devices explicitly designed to attach to CBRS Small Cell Radios and
Wi-Fi Access Points to verify coverage quality and location in a particular hex.

Following [HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md), Mobile Mappers will
be eligible to earn 20% of Mobile rewards for verifying the Network. Please note, this 20% of reward
emissions is shared with existing Discover Mappers.
