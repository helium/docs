# MOBILE Proof of Coverage

## Introduction

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called "Proof-of-Coverage" ("PoC") to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

While current 5G Hotspots are _also_ able to participate in the IoT Network and PoC, the CBRS Small
Cell and 5G aspects of a 5G Hotspot require a new approach to validating PoC.

Modeled Coverage introduces a fundamental difference in using hexes for the Mobile Network compared
to the IoT Network where hexes determine the locations and number of Hotspots within the given hex.
In the Mobile Network, hexes determine where the coverage exists. Modeled Coverage data allows us to
un-tie a Radio's location from its signal strength and propagation.

:::tip One Way Traffic

A CBRS Small Cell Radio ("Radio") can only operate as a transmitter; they cannot receive incoming
data and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity; read more about
[Proof-of-Coverage](/iot/proof-of-coverage)

## Proof of Coverage Milestones

Determining useful coverage and the impact on MOBILE PoC rewards will be based on a number of
factors:

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/mobile-poc-milestones.png')} />

These factors will be rolled out in stages over the next twelve months and explained in detail to
ensure Network Builders can take concrete steps to plan or improve their setups. Check out the
[MOBILE PoC Roadmap](https://blog.helium.com/mobile-proof-of-coverage-the-road-ahead-73a25601a13d).

## Reward Algorithm

The proposed new algorithm for MOBILE Reward calculation in the MOBILE Rewards Oracle is as follows:

1. Supply the declared transmitter power of each Radio and its location to the Obstruction Data
   Oracle.
2. Get all hexes that have coverage from Outdoor Radios based on the information from the
   Obstruction Data Oracle.
3. Based on the location of Indoor Radios, get all hexes with Indoor coverage and all adjacent
   hexes.
4. Use projected signal loss information from the Obstruction Data Oracle to determine the potential
   signal strength of each Outdoor Radio in each hex.
5. For each hex, get at most 5 Outdoor Radios with the top signal strength of the same level.

- If there are more than 5 Radios with the same signal strength level, use the `coverage_claim_time`
  value to determine the top 5 oldest installations where `coverage_claim_time` is the timestamp
  when the Radio received the spectrum access grant for the first time.
- To prevent rewarding "dead" Radios, we propose to reset `coverage_claim_time` if the Radio was not
  generating a Heartbeat for more than 72 hours and use the time of the last Heartbeat as the new
  `coverage_claim_time`.

6. Get max 5 Indoor Radios using the same approach as above for Outdoor Radios.
7. Based on [Modeled Coverage Reward Tiers](#modeled-coverage-reward-tiers), sum up all estimated
   coverage points earned by each Radio in all hexes and multiply that by `speedtest_multiplier` for
   each Radio.
8. Divide the total number of MOBILE Rewards emitted during the Rewards Period by the sum of
   multiples of [`heartbeat_multiplier`](#heartbeat-reward-tiers),
   [`estimated_reward_points`](#modeled-coverage-reward-tiers), and
   [`speedtest_multiplier`](#speed-test-reward-tiers) for each Radio to determine MOBILE Rewards per
   `estimated_reward_point` for Radio with a passing Speed Test and valid Heartbeats.
9. Multiply the MOBILE per `estimated_reward_point` by the sum of each Radio's reward points to
   determine the MOBILE Rewards for each Radio.

The new formula for Reward calculation per Radio:

$$
W = k_H \times k_S \times C_E \times W_p
$$

| Variable | Description                      |

| $W$      | Total rewards                    |

| $k_S$    | Speed test multiplier            |
| $C_E$    | Estimated coverage points        |

## Modeled Coverage

With the
[passing](https://heliumvote.com/legacy/14jH67zhctwb3B5NmwiAjaXQuyF7jZMZCAnfyBYhSpRS3L22sQE) of
[HIP-74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md)
Modeled Coverage aims to allow for more appropriate Rewards and incentivizes the deployment of
Radios at optimal locations.

This new algorithm uses the location of the Radio to calculate MOBILE Rewards based on the number of
res12 hexes receiving coverage from a given Radio.

The MOBILE Rewards Oracle will calculate a coverage model for each Radio by considering the physical
location, antenna direction, radio max transmit power, and Obstruction Data Oracle inputs to
calculate the number of res12 hexes receiving coverage from each Radio.

Depending on the number of res12 hexes and the resulting signal power in each, the MOBILE Rewards
Oracle will allot **Coverage Points** to a given Radio for calculating its MOBILE Rewards instead of
assuming a fixed Radio Type multiplier Reward.

### Reward Hexagon Sizing

Analysis of the coverage by a single Outdoor Radio with Modeled Coverage data shows that the res8
hex used in the IoT Network is too large to represent a Radio's coverage. Using res12 hexes better
aligns with what an Outdoor Radio can reasonably cover, with an average area of 0.0003071 kmÂ² and an
edge length of 9.4 m, slightly bigger than an average single-family home.

To summarize:

- Hexes in the Mobile Network identify the level of coverage from all the different Radios providing
  coverage to each res12 hex.
- A Radio can provide coverage for a hex it is not located within.
- A Radio can earn Rewards by providing coverage in multiple hexes.

To help visualize the significant difference between these two resolutions, below is a map with a
green res8 hex and a purple res12 hex inside.

  src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/hex-12-and-hex-8-comparison.png')}
/>

### Modeled Coverage Reward Tiers

:::info

Each Radio is given a **coverage points** value depending on the number and signal strength of the
res12 hexes receiving coverage from the Radio.

:::

#### Outdoor Radios

Modeled Coverage replaces Radio Type multipliers with **coverage points** represented by four tiers
of potential signal power as modeled by the Obstruction Data Oracle - `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, and
`None`.

The reward tiers for Outdoor Radios will be as follows:

|                               |    Tier 1     |           Tier 2           |           Tier 3            |      Tier 4      |
| ----------------------------- | :-----------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :--------------: |
| **Potential Signal Power**    | $P > -95 dBm$ | $-95 dBm \ge P > -105 dBm$ | $-105 dBm \ge P > -115 dBm$ | $P \le -115 dBm$ |
| **Potential Signal Level**    |     High      |           Medium           |             Low             |       None       |
| **Estimated coverage points** |      16       |             8              |              4              |        0         |

:::note Modeled Coverage Distance Limit for Outdoor Radios

The Modeled Coverage algorithm limits the radius of coverage for a given Radio to 1000 meters. This
value results from evaluating a selection of "ideal case" Radios, which provided usable coverage to
roughly 500 meters and doubled that value. A larger radius would also be too heavy for the
computation and is a current trade-off.

:::

#### Indoor Radios

Like Outdoor, Indoor Radios can collect MOBILE Rewards by providing coverage in multiple hexes.

The Obstruction Data Oracle cannot evaluate coverage by Indoor Radios as there are no good and
reliable data sources about obstacles in indoor spaces. Instead, the Modeled Coverage Oracle uses an
approximation based on the data gathered while testing certified Indoor Radios in various indoor
settings.

From this testing, the hex in which an Indoor Radio is physically located receives maximum signal
strength coverage, and all adjacent hexes receive lower signal strength. Therefore, the algorithm
errs on generosity to ensure equitable potential MOBILE Rewards for Indoor Radio coverage.

Estimated per-hex coverage points for Indoor Radios are intentionally significantly higher than
those awarded to Outdoor Radios to balance the importance of Indoor Radios in the Mobile Network
with their relatively smaller coverage footprints.

The reward tiers for Indoor Radios will be as follows:

|                               |   Tier 1   |       Tier 2       |
| ----------------------------- | :--------: | :----------------: |
| **Location**                  | Inside hex | All adjacent hexes |
| **Potential Signal Level**    |    High    |        Low         |
| **Estimated coverage points** |    400     |        100         |

These values were chosen by taking all the Outdoor Radios in an example area and analyzing the
resulting distribution of estimated coverage points per Radio. Estimated coverage point values were
chosen such that Indoor Radios receive roughly Â¼th the estimated coverage points as the 95th
percentile Outdoor Radios and about Â½ the points of the average Outdoor Radio.

These results align with the current Radio Type Multipliers approach `1:2.5:4` for Indoor Radios,
Outdoor Radios, and High-Power Outdoor Radios. Figure 2 below is the cumulative distribution
function plot of the sample market Outdoor Radio estimated coverage points.

<img className="explorerSidebar" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/propagation_point_cdf.png')} />

### Modeled Coverage Explorer

:::tip check coverage

View mobile Hotspot coverage on the [Modeled Coverage Explorer](https://planner.hellohelium.com/).

:::

Modeled Coverage data will play a key role in providing information to visualize it, with more data
added as additional external sources (e.g., [Mobile Mappers](/mobile/mobile-mappers)) come into
play.

HIP-74 proposed the creation of a new Mobile Explorer dedicated exclusively to the Mobile Network as
adding more features and data for MOBILE Rewards to the IoT Network Explorer becomes practically
impossible as the Mobile Network grows. The first iteration of the Mobile Explorer proposes a basic
map overlay of 5G data coverage with signal strength.

---

## Uptime Heartbeats

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that a connected Radio is authorized to
transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds. This
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

To encourage reliable signal availability, 5G Hotspots and connected CBRS Small Cell Radios must
generate at least one valid heartbeat per hour in 12 unique hours of the 24-hour Reward Period.

### Heartbeat Reward Tiers

:::info Heartbeat impact on Radio rewards

Each Radio is given a **heartbeat multiplier** of either `0` or `1`.

:::

Each Radio is awarded 1 point for a valid heartbeat in each hour, with a maximum of 24 points in the
Reward Period. All Radios with at least 12 points in the 24-hour Reward Period are given a
`heartbeat multiplier` of `1` and will be eligible to earn MOBILE Rewards.

## Backhaul Speed Tests {#backhaul-speed-tests}

A 5G Hotspot automatically performs Speed Tests, with the results averaged by the MOBILE PoC Oracle.
The MOBILE PoC Oracle includes these Speed Test metrics in the Rewards calculations for each 5G
Hotspot.

The 5G Hotspot will randomly measure download, upload, and latency to the MOBILE verifier twice in a
given 24-hour period. If a test can not complete successfully, the 5G Hotspot automatically retries
every 30 minutes until a Speed Test is successful. The first Speed Test for a newly installed 5G
Hotspot is performed within the first 12 hours after powering it on.

A minimum of two and maximum of six Speed Tests are required in the previous 48 hours to calculate a
Moving average results for each download, upload, and latency, after which a new series of Speed
Test results must be collected before a Moving Average can be calculated.

### Speed Test Reward Tiers

:::info Speed test impact on Radio rewards

Each 5G Hotspot is given a `speedtest multiplier` of either `0.0`, `0.25`, `0.5` or `1.0`.

This multiplier is applied to all connected Radios in rewards calculations.

:::

Many locations where CBRS connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always
have the high-speed Internet connectivity needed to meet the acceptable Internet requirements for
Genesis rewards consistently.

Often these areas do not have good cellular coverage either. That's why we believe it is essential
to incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

In response to community feedback and further exploration by Chris from DeWiPulse for his
[analysis of and commentary on public Internet data in the United States,](https://dewipulse.com/connectivity-where-it-matters/)
Speed Test results are categorized into one of four Tiers - `Acceptable`, `Degraded`, `Poor`, and
`Fail`.

| Speed Test Tier | Speedtest Multiplier | Requirement (speeds in Mbps, latency in ms)                  |
| :-------------: | :------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acceptable**  |       `1.00x`        | `100+` Download, **AND** `10+` Upload, **AND** `<50` Latency |
|  **Degraded**   |       `0.50x`        | `50+` Download, **AND** `5+` Upload, **AND** `<75` Latency   |
|    **Poor**     |       `0.25x`        | `30+` Download, **AND** `2+` Upload, **AND** `<100` Latency  |
|    **Fail**     |       `0.00x`        | `<30` Download, **OR** `<2` Upload, **OR** `>100` Latency    |

Tiered Speed Test values are used as a multiplier in Rewards calculations as follows:

- Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minimum value of each Download, Upload, and
  Latency (logical `AND`).
- Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload, or Latency
  are considered to have `Failed` and are not eligible for Rewards until the Speed Test Average is
  improved (logical `OR`).

:::tip Requirements Will Evolve

As the needs and realities of the Network change, backhaul requirements will evolve to better suit
the Network and its users.
