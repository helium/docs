## Emissions Curve

HIP-53 defined a max supply of 250B (billion) MOBILE with issuance halvenings every two years
aligned with the HNT issuance halvenings. The first MOBILE halving will occur on August 1, 2023, to
align with HNT halving and will continue on a 2-year cycle afterward. Creating a "stub period" as
defined by [HIP-53: Mobile subDAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md),
which will begin when standard emissions of MOBILE tokens begin (and MOBILE can be redeemed by HNT
in the subDAO's treasury).

[HIP-75](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0075-mobile-poc-initiate-programmatic-minting-and-updated-emissions-curve.md#economic-changes-to-emissions-curve)
further modifiled the emission schedule and started the programatic minting of MOBILE on Feb
1st 2023.

[here](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0075-mobile-poc-programmatic-minting/mobile-emissions-schedule-HIP53-vs-HIP75.pdf).

The date for the treasury implementation is April 18, 2023 and dependent on core developers
implementing the HNT token treasury and redemption transactions on the Solana Blockchain as defined
for all new subDAOs in Phase 2 of
[HIP-51: Helium DAO](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md).

## Pre-Mine

As defined in [HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md) and
[HIP-53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview), and
[approved by community-wide votes](https://heliumvote.com/14rifUhocpzdwsrWaG5PDbdREDkzyesKe1hXuWzibv8h9DdqKLe),
the Helium Foundation receives an allocation of 50B (billion) of 250B MOBILE tokens in the form of a
pre-mine.

### Genesis Period Rewards

The Helium Foundation will work with the core developers to initiate the Genesis period of MOBILE
rewards. 100M (million) tokens will be programmatically issued per day to all active Helium 5G
Hotspots during the Genesis period.

Details of the proportional mining rewards for active 5G Small Cell Radios
[can be found here.](/mobile/proof-of-coverage) Any MOBILE not mined during the Genesis period may
be reallocated to Grants and Operations.

### Grants and Operations

The Helium Foundation will distribute grants to teams making core contributions to the development
of the MOBILE subDAO. Grants will be distributed based on defined deliverables and milestones.

The Nova Labs team will be the first grant recipient for work-in-progress and ongoing development
for the MOBILE subDAO. This is spread across three deliverables with 5B MOBILE per milestone for a
total grant of 15B MOBILE:

- Milestone 1: Ability for 5G Hotspots to earn MOBILE (by August 2022)
- Milestone 2: Development and release of programmatic treasury (by October 2022)
  - Actual Programatic Minting started Feb 1 2023
  - The treasury is due to start on April 19 2023
- Milestone 3: Proof-of-Coverage based rewards (by January 2023)
  - Actual date TBC.

The remaining 15B MOBILE is reserved for other work pertaining to Oracles and Mappers development or
other community contributions.

### Growth Activities Related to the MOBILE subDAO

Reserved for marketing and educational campaigns around the MOBILE subDAO.

## Reward Algorithm

The proposed new algorithm for MOBILE Reward calculation in the MOBILE Rewards Oracle is as follows:

1. Supply the declared transmitter power of each Radio and its location to the Obstruction Data
   Oracle.
2. Get all hexes that have coverage from Outdoor Radios based on the information from the
   Obstruction Data Oracle.
3. Based on the location of Indoor Radios, get all hexes with Indoor coverage and all adjacent
   hexes.
4. Use projected signal loss information from the Obstruction Data Oracle to determine the potential
   signal strength of each Outdoor Radio in each hex.
5. For each hex, get at most 5 Outdoor Radios with the top signal strength of the same level.

- If there are more than 5 Radios with the same signal strength level, use the `coverage_claim_time`
  value to determine the top 5 oldest installations where `coverage_claim_time` is the timestamp
  when the Radio received the spectrum access grant for the first time.
- To prevent rewarding "dead" Radios, we propose to reset `coverage_claim_time` if the Radio was not
  generating a Heartbeat for more than 72 hours and use the time of the last Heartbeat as the new
  `coverage_claim_time`.

6. Get max 5 Indoor Radios using the same approach as above for Outdoor Radios.
7. Based on [Modeled Coverage Reward Tiers](#modeled-coverage-reward-tiers), sum up all estimated
   coverage points earned by each Radio in all hexes and multiply that by `speedtest_multiplier` for
   each Radio.
8. Divide the total number of MOBILE Rewards emitted during the Rewards Period by the sum of
   multiples of [`heartbeat_multiplier`](#heartbeat-reward-tiers),
   [`estimated_reward_points`](#modeled-coverage-reward-tiers), and
   [`speedtest_multiplier`](#speed-test-reward-tiers) for each Radio to determine MOBILE Rewards per
   `estimated_reward_point` for Radio with a passing Speed Test and valid Heartbeats.
9. Multiply the MOBILE per `estimated_reward_point` by the sum of each Radio's reward points to
   determine the MOBILE Rewards for each Radio.

The new formula for Reward calculation per Radio:

$$
W = k_H \times k_S \times C_E \times W_p
$$

| Variable | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| $W$      | Total rewards                    |
| $k_H$    | Heartbeat multiplier             |
| $k_S$    | Speedtest multiplier             |
| $C_E$    | Estimated coverage points        |
| $W_p$    | Epoch rewards per coverage point |

### Calculation Example

For simplicity, assume that the total MOBILE Rewards per period is 10,000.

|    Radio    | Heartbeat | Heartbeat multiplier $k_H$ | Speed Test | Speedtest Multiplier $k_S$ | Hex 1 - Hex 10 | Hex 11 - Hex 20 | Hex 21 - Hex 220 | Total Coverage Points | Total Reward Points |

Points for one Reward Period.

$$
R  \times (1 \times 1 \times 1040 + 1 \times 0.25 \times 120 + 1 \times 0.5 \times 700) = 10,000

Where R is the reward per one estimated coverage point.
