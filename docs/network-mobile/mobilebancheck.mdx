Hotspots provide valuable utility, and this utility must be protected. Any device found tampering
with or attempting to falsify data will be permanently removed from the network and cannot be
reactivated.

When buying a Hotspot, always work with trusted vendors. Use this tool to check Mobile Hotspot
