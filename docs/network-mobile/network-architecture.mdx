## Overview

The Helium Mobile Network has six main components:

- **Users:** Users of the network are people who get their mobile service from a participating
  wireless service provider e.g. Helium Mobile, Movistar, WeFi, GoogleFi, or others. Users may
  sometimes be called subscribers. Users consume voice, text, and data services via a passpoint
  capable smartphone.
- **Hotspots:** Hotspots are Wi-Fi radios that have been configured to connect to the Helium Mobile
  Network. Hotspots can either be Helium Mobile Hotspots designed from the ground up to support the
  Helium network, or Converted Network Wi-Fi radios that support Wi-Fi Passpoint.
- **Core:** The Core of the Helium Mobile Network is a message router responsible for managing the
  links to partner Service Provider Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) functions.
  In addition to AAA functions, the Core also collects metrics for network visualization. Lastly,
  the Core provides operations, administration, and management (OAM) functions for radio owners.
- **Oracles:** Oracles are servers and data stores that provide an interface between the Helium
  Mobile Network and the blockchain. Oracles do data processing and consolidation to ensure
  efficient use of blockchain resources. In general oracles are application specific and process a
  specific dataset for a specific blockchain related function.
- **Blockchain:** The Solana blockchain provides a public ledger which can be used for following
  events on the Helium Mobile Network. The blockchain also manages rewards eligibility and
  distribution based on set of rules decided by community governance.
- **Service Providers:** Service Providers are the mobile service providers (voice, text, data) that
  use the Helium Mobile Network for offload and coverage enhancement. Subscribers to these service
  providers automatically connect when they are in the coverage area of a Helium Mobile Network
  radio.

## Users

To become a user of the network you must get your mobile service from a participating Helium Mobile
Network Service Provider. Once you have a subscription, your carrier will either push a Passpoint
Profile to your phone via a Carrier Bundle or via their Carrier App.

For example, when you join Helium Mobile, and install the mobile
app([Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-mobile/id1640323514) or
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.mobile.wireless&pcampaignid=web_share)),
you'll be asked to approve the installation of "Enhanced Coverage" profile which configures
Passpoint on your phone. After this anytime you come in range of a

## Hotspots

[Helium Mobile Hotspots](https://www.helium.com/mobile#hotspots) are Wi-Fi radios that have been
built from the ground up to integrate telecom technology with blockchain technology. This
specifically means the firmware running on these radios has been secured using industry leading
security features like
[TrustZone](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102418/0101/What-is-TrustZone-),
[Secure Boot](https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/secure-boot-and-image-authentication-version_final.pdf),
and Full Disk Encryption. As a result, these radios are eligible for earning Proof of Coverage
rewards because the firmware producing the Proof of Coverage metrics is trusted.

Converted Radios, whether enrolled through the Helium+ program or via the Self Server portal, have a
lower trust rating and are therefore currently limited to earning Data Credit rewards.

### The Telco Protocols

All hotspots on the Helium Mobile Network support 2 main protocols that enable users easy access and
allow Service Providers to securely offload traffic. These protocols are Passpoint and RadSec.

[Passpoint](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/passpoint) is the protocol that allows Helium
radios to advertise their support for Service Providers that participate on the Helium Network. When
a subscribers phone gets in range and see this protocol and the advertised support for it's Service
Provider, it will automatically join the network using the Passpoint Profile installed by the user
or their Service Provider. Passpoint removes the user friction of having to ask for the Wi-Fi
password giving users a universal credential they can use across the entire Helium Mobile Network.

The second protocol that enables the magic of carrier offload is called
["RadSec."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadSec) RadSec is like a secure tunnel for important
network conversations. Think of it this way: when a user or device needs to prove who they are to a
network (like showing an ID), RadSec makes sure that proof is sent in a locked box. This locked box
can only be opened by the right people, preventing anyone else from spying on or tampering with the
information inside.

In more technical terms, RadSec stands for “RADIUS over TLS.” RADIUS is a system that handles things
like logins and permissions, and TLS adds a layer of encryption so the data can’t be viewed or
changed in transit. Essentially, RadSec is just a safer way to verify identities and manage access
on networks, protecting sensitive information along the way.

RadSec also transports and protects the accounting information central to the Helium Data Rewards
model and Service Provider offload agreements. [RADIUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS) is a
standard telco accounting protocol used to communicate the start, interim, and stop usage reports
for users once they connect and start using data. This accounting data originates in the Hotspot and
via RadSec eventually makes it way to the Service Provider and to the oracles for Data Rewards.

An easy way to think about these two important protocols is Passpoint is how the Hotspots talk to
the users smartphones, and RadSec is how the Hotspots talk to the Service Providers.

### Local Breakout

All Helium Mobile Hotspots send user traffic to the internet using a concept called Local Breakout.
This just means the data goes from your phone, to the hotspot, then to the internet without going
back to your Service Provider Core, or to the Helium Network Core. Using local breakout provides the
lowest latency connection and the best user experience.

## The Core

The core of the Helium Mobile Network is a control message broker. The core mainly processes 2 kinds
of message from the hotspots:

- RADIUS messages
- Operation, Administration, and Management messages

### RADIUS in the Core

Now that we understand a little more about RADIUS, a key function of the core is to act as a RADIUS
message router. The core takes all the incoming RADIUS packets from the Hotspots and from Service
Providers and routes the message either to the correct Service Provider or to the correct hotspot.

During this routing the core also reads the radius messages and uses the data contained within to
capture statistical data. The captured data is then sent to the oracles for various accounting,
rewarding, eligibility, and anti-gaming analyses.

### OAM in the Core

In addition to RADIUS processing, the Core also hosts a handful of creature comforts type services
generally referred for as OAM or Operations, Administrations, and Management functions. Examples of
OAM functions are stuff like configuration management, monitoring and alerting, status reporting and
display, network statistic collection and visualization. An example of the visualization tools this
enables is the [Helium World](https://world.helium.com/en/mobile) explorer.

In addition OAM includes giving builders a dashboard where they can monitor and configure their
deployed radios. The
[Helium Mobile Builder Dashboard](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com/auth/login/methods/helium-mobile-wallet)
is hosted on and powered by data collected by the core.

## Oracles

When operating a telecom network on a blockchain two challenges present themselves, the volume of
data produced and flowing around and then the privacy and regulation around that data. Oracles
primary function are to collect and distill telco data to make it ready to share on a public
blockchain. The "making it ready" part can either be aggregation and anonymization so that regulated
privacy sensitive data is not shared on chain, or it can be aggregation and analysis so that massive
bulk data

While the following list may change, current oracles for the mobile network include:

- **mobile-ingest**: This oracle receives all data from hotspots and service providers.
- **mobile-packet-verifier**: This oracle tracks data usage on the network and is in charge of
  burning DC from the right payer.
- **mobile-verifier**: This oracle processes data from Hotspots and Service Providers to evaluate
  eligibility and calculate rewards.
- **mobile-reward-index**: This oracle serves as an interface to make claiming rewards to an owners
  wallet work on chain.
- **mobile-config**: This oracle makes data which lives on chain available to other service such as
  Helium smartphone apps.

## Blockchain

The blockchain used by the Helium network is Solana. Helium is considered an L2 or Layer 2 chain on
top of the Solana L1 or Layer 1 chain. A good high level explainer of these terms can be
[found here](https://medium.com/@reginackm/eli5-blockchain-layers-1-and-2-simply-explained-8739131a307a).
The primary functions of the blockchain are to implement rewarding of wallets for Helium radio
owners and Helium Mobile subscribers and to serve as the historical public ledger that allows
transparency into the operation of the Helium Network.

[For more on blockchain see](/solana)

How the blockchain operates, the rules it follows for eligibility and rewards allocation are defined
by a collection of Helium Improvement Proposals or HIPs. For the full collection of HIPs
[see here](https://github.com/helium/HIP).

## Service Providers

Service Providers are Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) or Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)
who opt to augment their cellular network with Helium Network offload coverage. Operators can do
this by doing a straight forward Passpoint and RadSec integration after which the Service Providers
subscribers will automatically connect to Helium Network radios.

In the Helium Network Service Providers can either be directly involved as a on-chain service
provider or they can be a roaming partner with an on-chain Service Provider. The distinction here is
who's wallet the data credits are burned from when data is used. In the case of an on-chain service
provider they are the owner of the wallet and payer for data usage. If the Service Provider is not
and on-chain service provider, they must have a roaming/offload relationship with an on-chain
provider in which case it is the on-chain providers wallet that pays for the data usage.

The process to become an on-chain provider is documented in
[HIP 53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview)
