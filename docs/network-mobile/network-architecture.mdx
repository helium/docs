## Overview

The Helium Mobile Network has six main components:

**Users:** Users of the network are people who get their mobile service from a participating
wireless service provider e.g. Helium Mobile (A cellular provider built directly on the Helium
Network), Movistar, or others. Users consume voice, text, and data services using a smartphone that
supports Passpoint. Users are also referred to as 'subscribers'.

**Hotspots:** Hotspots are Wi-Fi radios that have been configured to connect to the Helium Mobile
Network. Hotspots can either be Helium Mobile Hotspots designed from the ground up to support the
Helium network, or Converted Networks that support Wi-Fi Passpoint.

**Core:** The Core of the Helium Mobile Network is a message router responsible for managing the
links to partner Service Provider Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) functions. In
addition to AAA functions, the Core also collects metrics for network visualization. Lastly, the
Core provides operations, administration, and management (OAM) functions for radio owners.

**Oracles:** Oracles are servers and data stores that provide an interface between the Helium Mobile
Network and the blockchain. Oracles do data processing and consolidation to ensure efficient use of
blockchain resources. In general oracles are application specific and process a specific dataset for
a specific blockchain related function.

**Blockchain:** The Solana blockchain provides a public ledger which can be used for following
events on the Helium Mobile Network. The blockchain also manages rewards eligibility and
distribution based on set of rules decided by community governance.

**Service Providers:** Service Providers are the mobile service providers (voice, text, data) that
use the Helium Mobile Network for offload and coverage enhancement. Subscribers to these service
providers automatically connect when they are in the coverage area of a Helium Mobile Network radio.

## Users

To become a user of the network, subscribers must obtain mobile service from a participating Helium
Mobile Network Service Provider. Once subscribed, the carrier will provision a Passpoint Profile to
the subscriber's phone via a Carrier Bundle or Carrier App.

For example, when subscribers join Helium Mobile and install the mobile app
([Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-mobile/id1640323514) or
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.mobile.wireless&pcampaignid=web_share)),
they will be prompted to approve the installation of an "Enhanced Coverage" profile, configuring
Passpoint on their device. Afterward, whenever a subscriber enters coverage range of a Hotspot, the
device automatically connects.

## Hotspots

[Helium Mobile Hotspots](https://www.helium.com/mobile#hotspots) are Wi-Fi radios that have been
built from the ground up to integrate telecom technology with blockchain technology. This
specifically means the firmware running on these radios has been secured using industry leading
security features like
[TrustZone](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102418/0101/What-is-TrustZone-),
[Secure Boot](https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/secure-boot-and-image-authentication-version_final.pdf),
and Full Disk Encryption. As a result, these radios are eligible for earning Proof of Coverage
rewards because the firmware producing the Proof of Coverage metrics is trusted.

Converted Radios, whether enrolled through the Helium Plus program or via the Self-Serve portal,
have a lower trust rating and thus currently earn only data transfer rewards.

### The Telco Protocols

All Hotspots on the Helium Mobile Network support 2 main protocols that enable users easy access and
allow Service Providers to securely offload traffic. These protocols are Passpoint and RadSec.

[Passpoint](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/passpoint) is the protocol that allows Helium
radios to advertise their support for Service Providers that participate on the Helium Network. When
a subscriber's phone enters the coverage area and detects the protocol and advertised support for
its Service Provider, the device automatically connects to the network using the Passpoint Profile
installed by the user or their Service Provider. Passpoint removes the user friction of having to
ask for the Wi-Fi password giving users a universal credential they can use across the entire Helium
Mobile Network.

The second protocol that enables the magic of carrier offload is called
[RadSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadSec). RadSec is like a secure tunnel for important network
conversations. Think of it this way: when a user or device needs to prove who they are to a network
(like showing an ID), RadSec makes sure that proof is sent in a locked box. This locked box can only
be opened by the right people, preventing anyone else from spying on or tampering with the
information inside.

In more technical terms, RadSec stands for “RADIUS over TLS.” RADIUS is a system that handles things
like logins and permissions, and TLS adds a layer of encryption so the data can't be viewed or
changed in transit. Essentially, RadSec is just a safer way to verify identities and manage access
on networks, protecting sensitive information along the way.

RadSec also transports and protects the accounting information central to the Helium Data Rewards
model and Service Provider offload agreements. [RADIUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS) is a
standard telco accounting protocol used to communicate the start, interim, and stop usage reports
for users once they connect and start using data. This accounting data originates in the Hotspot and
via RadSec eventually makes it way to the Service Provider and to the oracles for Data Rewards.

Passpoint facilitates communication between Hotspots and subscribers' smartphones, while RadSec
facilitates secure communication between Hotspots and Service Providers.

### Local Breakout

All Helium Mobile Hotspots send user traffic to the internet using a concept called Local Breakout.
This means the data travels directly from the subscriber's device to the Hotspot and then to the
internet, without routing through the Service Provider Core or Helium Network Core. Using local
breakout provides the lowest latency connection and the best user experience.

## The Core

The core of the Helium Mobile Network is a control message broker. The core mainly processes 2 kinds
of message from the Hotspots:

- RADIUS messages
- Operation, Administration, and Management messages

### RADIUS in the Core

A key function of the Core is acting as a RADIUS message router. The core takes all the incoming
RADIUS packets from the Hotspots and from Service Providers and routes the message either to the
correct Service Provider or to the correct Hotspot.

During this routing the core also reads the radius messages and uses the data contained within to
capture statistical data. The captured data is then sent to the oracles for various accounting,
rewarding, eligibility, and anti-gaming analyses.

### OAM in the Core

In addition to RADIUS processing, the Core hosts several convenience services referred to as
Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) functions. Examples of OAM functions include
configuration management, monitoring and alerting, status reporting, and network statistics
collection and visualization. An example of the visualization tools this enables is the
[Helium World](https://world.helium.com/en/mobile) explorer.

Additionally, OAM provides builders with a dashboard for monitoring and configuring deployed radios.
The
[Helium Mobile Builder Dashboard](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com/auth/login/methods/helium-mobile-wallet)
is hosted on and powered by data collected by the core.

## Oracles

When operating a telecom network on a blockchain two challenges present themselves: managing large
volumes of data and addressing privacy and regulatory requirements associated with this data. The
primary function of Oracles is collecting and processing telecom data, preparing it for sharing on a
public blockchain. Preparing the data involves aggregation and anonymization to prevent sharing
regulated, privacy-sensitive data on-chain, or performing aggregation and analysis to reduce the
volume of data.

While the following list may change, current oracles for the mobile network include:

- **mobile-ingest**: This oracle receives all data from Hotspots and service providers.
- **mobile-packet-verifier**: This oracle tracks data usage on the network and is in charge of
  burning DC from the right payer.
- **mobile-verifier**: This oracle processes data from Hotspots and Service Providers to evaluate
  eligibility and calculate rewards.
- **mobile-reward-index**: This oracle serves as an interface to make claiming rewards to an owners
  wallet work on chain.
- **mobile-config**: This oracle makes data which lives on chain available to other service such as
  Helium smartphone apps.

## Blockchain

The Helium Network utilizes the Solana blockchain. For Helium, the primary functions of the
blockchain are to implement rewarding of wallets for Helium radio owners and Helium Mobile
subscribers and to serve as the historical public ledger that allows transparency into the operation
of the Helium Network.

For more on Helium's use of blockchain see the [Solana](/solana) documentation.

## Service Providers

Service Providers are Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) or Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)
who opt to enhance their own their cellular network with Helium Network offload coverage. Operators
can achieve this through a straightforward Passpoint and RadSec integration, enabling automatic
connectivity for their subscribers to Helium Network radios.

In the Helium Network Service Providers can either be directly involved as a on-chain service
provider or they can be a roaming partner as an on-chain Service Provider. The distinction here is
who's wallet the data credits are burned from when data is used. In the case of an on-chain service
provider they are the owner of the wallet and payer for data usage. If the Service Provider is not
an on-chain provider, a roaming or offload agreement with an on-chain provider is required, whereby
the on-chain provider's wallet covers the Data Credit consumption.

The process to become an on-chain provider is documented in
[HIP 53](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0053-mobile-dao.md#economics-overview).
