### Local Development

Start a local development server using the `yarn start` command and open up a browser window. Most
changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```bash
❯ yarn start
[INFO] Starting the development server...

```

### Link Checking before your PR

Checking links can be accomplished by using the `yarn build` command.

```bash
❯ yarn build

[SUCCESS] Generated static files in "build".
[INFO] Use `npm run serve` command to test your build locally.
```

### Developing

Each time you save files under your local repo the site will get rebuilt and the pages refreshed on
the fly, there is no need to keep restarting Yarn.
