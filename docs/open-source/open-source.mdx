# Helium is Open Source

The Helium Network is built almost entirely on open source code. And we actively
encourage the community to develop and contribute to all parts of the Network.
Below is a subset of the code that plays an integral role in the Helium Network.
The full list can be found on the official
[Helium GitHub Organization](https://github.com/helium).

### Helium Blockchain

These are the core libraries and repos that make up the Helium blockchain. Most
things here are written in Erlang.

- [Miner](https://github.com/helium/miner) - The Helium blockchain miner.

- [Blockchain Core](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core) - The glue that
  ties together things like the `Helium miner` and the `blockchain api`.

- [Blockchain API](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-api) - A full blockchain
  node that exposes a JSON API. It's ideal for supplying data to things like
  block explorers and mobile apps.

- [Erlang HoneyBadgerBFT](https://github.com/helium/erlang-hbbft) - An Erlang
  implementation of HoneyBadgerBFT's various protocols.

- [Erlang DKG](https://github.com/helium/erlang-dkg) - Helium's implementation
  of the protocol described in
  [Distributed Key Generation in the Wild](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/377.pdf).
  Prepare yourself for some math.

- [Erlang libp2p](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p) - Libp2p swarms
  written in (you guessed it) Erlang.
  
- [Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) - Command Line
  Interface, written in Rust, used to created and administer Helium wallets, and
  interact with the Helium Network.  
  
- [Helium JS](https://github.com/helium/helium-js) - Typescript SDKs for
  interacting with the Helium blockchain.
   
-  [Packet Purchaser](https://github.com/helium/packet-purchaser) - Service that buys 
   Helium LoRaWAN packets from the Network and delivers the them to a target LoRaWAN Network server.
   
- [Angry Purple Tiger](https://github.com/helium/angry-purple-tiger) - Ever
  wonder how your Miner got its cute little animal name? Here it is.


### LoRaWAN

The Helium Network is the largest, public LoRaWAN network in the world. This is
some of the code that makes it possible.

- [Packet Forwarder](https://github.com/helium/packet_forwarder) - Helium's fork
  of the Lora packet forwarder.
  
- [Light Gateway](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) - The next-generation packet 
  forwarder for the Helium-enabled gateways.

- [Helium Console](https://github.com/helium/console) - A web browser front-end for users to manage organizations and devices and a Helium Blockchain-compatible LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS).

- [Console Decoders](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders) - A collection
  of LoRaWAN sensor decoders used in Helium Console.

### Mobile Apps, Web Apps, and Sites

- [Helium Mobile Wallet](#) - #SOON

- [Helium Blockchain Explorer](https://github.com/helium/explorer) - Code that
  powers the greatest block explorer in the crypto world.

- [Helium Docs](https://github.com/helium/docs) - Docusaurus-based docs for all
  things Helium. (You're reading them.)
