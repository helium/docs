The migration of the Helium L1 to the Solana L1 brings several changes to the setup of the Network
and its associated subDAOs infrastructure. Chief among these changes is moving a lot of data that
has previously been "on-chain" (namely PoC data) "off-chain".

As such, this migration introduces several Oracles which serve as bridges between the external world
and the blockchain. These infrastructure changes allow the Helium Network to effectively introduce
new Networks as Decentralized Network Protocol (DNP) subDAOs, and more easily scale existing DNP
subDAOs (e.g., IOT) by removing existing bottlenecks.

With the deprecation of the Helium L1, changes to the [API](/api/) and
[ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) include:

1. Existing ETL codebase will no longer sync blocks.
2. Existing API codebase will no longer serve new data.
3. api.helium.io (built on top of existing ETL and API) will stay serving old data.
4. explorer-old.helium.com (built on top of api.helium.io and other APIs) will have data from the
   old chain and be migrated to explorer-old.helium.com.

New API access options include:

1. New datasets are available and will continue to be available on [AWS S3, via compressed Protobuf files](/oracles/oracle-data).
2. Sample API code has been published in the 
   [Oracles S3 Observer Sample App](https://github.com/dewi-alliance/oracle-observer-sample). It uses AWS Lambda to ingest the S3 files to a PostgreSQL database and serve them as JSON via an API.
3. Third parties are working on new APIs and services to replace existing tools
   (e.g., [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net/api/),
   [HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com/b/helium-offchain-api.html), Relay, etc.).
