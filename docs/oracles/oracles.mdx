<!--TODO: remove warning banner post migration  -->

The migration of the Helium L1 to the Solana L1 brings several changes to the setup of the Network
and its associated subDAOs infrastructure. Chief among these changes is moving a lot of data that
has previously been "on-chain" (namely PoC data) "off-chain".

As such, this migration introduces several Oracles which serve as bridges between the external world
and the blockchain. These infrastructure changes will allow the Helium Network to effectively
introduce new Networks as Decentralized Network Protocol (DNP) subDAOs and more easily scale
existing DNP subDAOs by removing existing bottlenecks.
