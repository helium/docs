## COnfig Service/OUI Owner Instructions

More on config service:
Config Service is an Oracle service that stores all routing information on the Helium IoT Network. Each OUI is registered in the Config Service, and may define multiple routes. 
Each route contains information such as:
1. DevEUI+AppEUI pairs — so we know which join requests to send your way
2. DevAddr ranges — so we know which uplinks to send your way
3. Server endpoint + port — so we know where to send packets to.

There are two ways of interacting with the Config Service, directly through GRPC APIs or through CLI (command-line-interface). We have developed a Console release that interacts with the Config Service automatically with the GRPC APIs. For instance, when someone created a new device on your Helium Console, the Config Service will immediately know about it because of the built-in automation.
However, to start using the new Console release, we first need to do some setup with the CLI.

1. Run this to pull & build the config service cli

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helium/helium-config-service-cli.git
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
cd helium-config-service-cli
cargo b --release
```
2. You can then find the built binary file `helium-config-service-cli` under `./target/release` inside the `helium-config-service-cli` directory. I’d rename it into
short such as main so you can type less words ( you can rename it by running
`mv helium-config-service-cli main` )

3. Now that we have the CLI binary, let’s just put it in a separate folder. This is recommended only for simplicity sake. Just copy main into the folder you created. You can reference the following commands
4. Next, let’s initialize some environment variables so that you don’t have to tell the
CLI the same thing over and over again in later commands
a. Run ./main env-init
b. Fill in http://mainnet-config.helium.io:6080/ for Config Service Host
c. Fill in the path to your Router Swarm Key for Keypair Location
d. Fill in 000024 for Net ID
e. Fill in your OUI for Assigned OUI
f. Fill in the number of multi-buy you want for Default Max Copies as a default for your routes. Note that,
i. before the Solana transition, the device level multi-buy setting on the Helium Console will still be respected
ii. after the Solana transition, the multi-buy setting will become a route level setting, which means that if you set your multi-buy as 5, then all devices under the DevAddr range & EUI pairs will have a multi-buy setting of 5.
iii. With that in mind, choose your desired multi-buy setting.
g. Then export the environment variables. You will see something like this and just add export to each line and run it. For instance, you would run export
HELIUM_MAX_COPIES=15 for your last environment variable. Do NOT put a space around the = sign
             cd ..
mkdir cli-testing
cd cli-testing
cp ../helium-config-service-cli/target/release/main .
OUI Owner Instructions 2

   5. Now, you are ready to generate your first route. Routes contain necessary information for us to know how to route a packet — DevEUI+AppEUI (for routing join requests), DevAddr range (for routing uplinks), Endpoint (so we know where to send the packet to), etc.
a. Run ./main route new —commit . We will only be setting up one route to manage all routing information associated with your OUI.
b. You can then see the empty route template. It should look like this, except that you should be seeing you own Net ID, assigned OUI, max_copies in there
  6. Next, let’s define DevAddr range so packet router knows which uplinks to route to your endpoint. Just use your OUI’s assigned DevAddr range, which you can get by
