## Helium Projects
#### Community projects developed on the Helium network.

### [Agricultural](/docs/projects/agricultural)
<img alt="Agricultural" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-agricultural.png')} /><br/>
Modern Agribusiness heavily depends on the ability to efficiently manage resources in order to reduce environmental impact, minimize cost and maximize yield. Farmers face an interconnected host of challenges and, therefore, are interested in incorporating innovative technological solutions. IoT devices have provided the ability to automatically monitor crops and animals, providing valuable data that has traditionally been collected manually, as well as controlling systems and equipment throughout an operation.

### [Dashboards](/docs/projects/dashboards)
<img alt="Dashboards" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-dashboard.png')} /><br/>
An IoT dashboard is typically web-based software that allows users to control the ecosystem, display status and historial information from each device, and manage its operation.

### [Environmental](/docs/projects/environmental)
<img alt="Environmental" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-environmental.png')} /><br/>
IoT applications in environmental monitoring are broad − environmental protection, extreme weather monitoring, water safety, endangered species protection, commercial farming, and more. In these applications, sensors detect and measure many types of environmental change.

### [Healthcare](/docs/projects/healthcare)
<img alt="Healthcare" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-healthcare.png')} /><br/>
IoT improves patient care in a number of ways. One of the most effective and widely-used applications of this technology is IoT-connected sensors on hospital wristbands and medical devices. These sensors securely collect patient information and transmit it to the cloud so that healthcare workers can evaluate it in real time.

### [Industrial](/docs/projects/industrial)
<img alt="Industrial" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-industrial.png')} /><br/>
The industrial internet of things (IIoT) refers to the extension and use of the internet of things (IoT) in industrial sectors and applications. With a strong focus on machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, big data, and machine learning, the IIoT enables industries and enterprises to have better efficiency and reliability in their operations.

### [Misc](/docs/projects/misc)
<img alt="Misc" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-misc.png')} /><br/>
IoT covers such a broad range of applications, here you will find projects that don't directly fall into the other categories.

### [Security](/docs/projects/security)
<img alt="Security" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-security.png')} /><br/>
IoT is heavily used in asset tracking and security.

### [Tracking](/docs/projects/tracking)
<img alt="Tracking" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-tracking.png')} /><br/>
IoT can also be used for real-time asset tracking; sensors are used to track individual assets within a consignment to provide regular updates on location as well as other critical readings, such as temperature and humidity in cold chain logistics, and regulated consignments, such as pharmaceuticals. This is an especially vital feature for high-risk or expensive goods that need continuous monitoring in order to protect the asset’s integrity.

### [Utility](/docs/projects/utility)
<img alt="Utility" src={useBaseUrl('img/projects/topic-utilities.png')} /><br/>
Projects that use IoT in more of an indirect manner. Includes development-related projects.
