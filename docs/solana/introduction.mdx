## Helium Is Moving To Solana

With [the passing](https://heliumvote.com/13Y79HnMVt4Epug2rbLYivMPvrcpC2wYUNbZK5Dga3tw3VBpBjk) of
[HIP-70: Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md)
Helium is moving to the Solana blockchain.

:::info Why Solana?

Read more about the
[Helium Core Team Proposal](https://medium.com/helium-foundation/hip-70-helium-core-team-proposes-to-migrate-to-solana-e7ea23a042e7)
and the process of
[Evaluation of Layer 1 Blockchains](https://medium.com/helium-foundation/hip-70-evaluating-layer-1-blockchains-for-the-helium-network-15f81af6941c)
on the [Helium Foundation Blog](https://heliumfoundation.medium.com/).

## Major Milestones

- Available on Solana DevNet for testing [Deployed]
- Smart Contract Audit [Finished]
- MainNet Launch [Soonâ„¢]

### Migration Process Steps

1. The Helium blockchain will officially halt.
2. Chain state will be snapshotted.
3. Existing $HNT and $MOBILE will be mapped to Solana. Hotspots will be minted as NFTs.
4. During the Migration, POC and Data Transfer will continue to function through the offchain
   Oracle, rewards will be claimable after the transition phase (estimated 24-48 hours) is complete.
5. Users and Exchanges can access their assets using the same private key on Solana (Solana and
   Helium blockchain use the same [ed25519 encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA)
   algorithm.)
6. Programmatic Treasury is planned to be activated in 2023 Q2, users will be able to convert
   $MOBILE and $IOT into $HNT on chain at that time.

## Migration Guides

As part of the Helium blockchain migration to Solana, there are some changes to existing Helium
Wallets and Applications for users to be aware of.

:::info Hotspot NFTs and Token Management

The Helium Network move to the Solana blockchain will result in all Hotspots automatically becoming
[Solana NFTs](https://solana.com/developers/nfts) which, along with the Helium Network Tokens (HNT,
IOT, and MOBILE), can be viewed in the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

:::

The following are migration guides for different users of Helium:

- [Application Builder](/solana/migration/application-builder)
- [Exchange](/solana/migration/exchange)
- [Governance Participant](/solana/migration/governance)
- [Hotspot Owner](/solana/migration/hotspot-owner)
- [Ledger User](/solana/migration/ledger)
- [LoRaWAN Network User](/solana/migration/network-user)
- [Maker](/solana/migration/maker)

## Helium Programs on Solana

The code for all of these Programs is open source, and available in the
[helium-program-library](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library) repository on Github.

:::info Program Audit

These contracts are being audited by [Sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/). A link to audit report will be
provided once complete.

<!--TODO: Not yet, when it's done link to audit report  -->

:::

#### circuit_breaker

- Program ID: `circAbx64bbsscPbQzZAUvuXpHqrCe6fLMzc2uKXz9g`
- Generic program wrapping sensitive mint authorities and token accounts in the Helium system to
  prevent large movements in the case of an exploit or bug.

#### data_credits

- Program ID: `credMBJhYFzfn7NxBMdU4aUqFggAjgztaCcv2Fo6fPT`
- Manages the purchase, delegation, and burning of data credits.

#### helium_entity_manager

- Program ID: `hemjuPXBpNvggtaUnN1MwT3wrdhttKEfosTcc2P9Pg8`
- Handles the issuance of NFTs representing entities that are rewardable on the Helium network, like
  hotspots and mappers.

#### helium_sub_daos

- Program ID: `hdaoVTCqhfHHo75XdAMxBKdUqvq1i5bF23sisBqVgGR`
- Manages the DAO/SubDAO structure proposed in HIP-51, including the minting of tokens to subdaos,
  HST holders, and the `lazy_distributor` for PoC earnings.

#### lazy_distributor

- Program ID: `1azyuavdMyvsivtNxPoz6SucD18eDHeXzFCUPq5XU7w`
- Allows off-chain oracles to distribute PoC rewards to rewardable assets (like hotspots) that are
  represented as NFTs.

#### lazy_transactions

- Program ID: `1atrmQs3eq1N2FEYWu6tyTXbCjP4uQwExpjtnhXtS8h`
- Used in the initial migration to Solana, this program allows compressing many transactions into a
  merkle root to be executed lazily. This guarentees all txs are executed exactly once.

#### treasury_management

- Program ID: `treaf4wWBBty3fHdyBpo35Mz84M8k3heKXmjmi9vFt5`
- Mangages the treasury of each SubDAO as proposed in HIP-51, allowing DNT tokens to be swapped for
  HNT according to a formula.

#### voter_stake_registry

- Program ID: `hvsrNC3NKbcryqDs2DocYHZ9yPKEVzdSjQG6RVtK1s8`
- Handles voting power via veHNT in Helium Governance.
