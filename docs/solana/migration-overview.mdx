<MigrationStatus />

Following the community-driven proposal, [HIP70 - Scaling the Helium Network][hip-70], the Helium
Network was successfully migrated to the Solana blockchain on **April 18, 2023, 9am PST** (16:00
UTC). This strategic move, voted in by the community, aims to capitalize on Solana's scalability,
low transaction costs, and high-performance capabilities, including its fast transaction throughput
and energy-efficient consensus mechanism.

The migration to Solana offers key benefits for the Helium Network: it enables the IoT and Mobile
networks to support even greater scale, supports more sophisticated Proof-of-Coverage algorithms,
and enhances the network's robustness, making it an even more robust solution for high-demand
applications.
