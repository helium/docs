Following the community-driven proposal,
[HIP70 - Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md),
the Helium Network will migrate to the Solana blockchain on **April 18, 2023**. This strategic move,
voted in by the community, aims to capitalize on Solana's scalability, low transaction costs, and
high-performance capabilities, including its fast transaction throughput and energy-efficient
consensus mechanism.

The migration to Solana offers key benefits for the Helium Network: it enables the IoT and Mobile
networks to support even greater scale, supports more sophisticated Proof of Coverage algorithms,
and enhances the network's robustness, making it an even more robust solution for high-demand
applications.

## Community & Discord

The Helium Foundation is supported by community governance groups through the Solana Migration
process.

<!--TODO:  Efforts are underway to streamline the Discord experience for current and new members. -->

## Community Developers/Core Devs

<!--TODO:  get help and join the conversation in discord channel -->
<!--TODO:  check out the helium-progrma libraby on github -->

[Solana Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/kBbATFA7PW) or review the
[Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com).

## ETL Instance Deployers

[Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-etl) will halt along with the blockchain
during the migration. Hosted instances of this service may chose to continue offering historical
data from the Helium L1 via these synced ETLs. A full snapshot of the Helium L1 will be retained and
uploaded for public availability post-migration. 

For ongoing insight into the operation of the Helium Network, please refer to the 
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) documentation.

---

## Helium Blockchain API Users

Along with the Blockchain ETL, the existing Helium API will serve only information up to the chain 
halt at time of migration. Knowing that some users will continue to rely on historical data, The 
Helium Foundation has formed an agreement with the API provider, BlockJoy to continue hosting this 
API following the migration.

For ongoing access, several organizations are already building new API services based on the 
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) available after the migration. These organizations include (but
not limited to), [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net), [HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com), 
[Relay](https://www.relaydevice.com) and [Watchium](https://watchium.disk91.com).
