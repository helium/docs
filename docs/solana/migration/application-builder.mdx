:::warning 🚧 This document is a work in progress. 🚧

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

As an application builder on top of Helium, many of the APIs and interfaces are changing.

If you are building against Hotspots, token accounts, or anything blockchain related, you should
start with the [Primer on Solana](/solana/primer) and continue through the
[Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/).

<!--TODO: uncomment this once oracle data page has content  -->
<!-- If you are building against the Proof of Coverage datasets, you should read through [Oracle Data](/solana/oracle-data) -->
