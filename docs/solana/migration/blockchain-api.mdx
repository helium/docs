The existing [Helium API](/api/blockchain/introduction) will serve only information up to the chain
halt at time of migration. Knowing that some users will continue to rely on historical data, The
Helium Foundation has formed an agreement with the API provider, BlockJoy to continue hosting this
API following the migration.

For ongoing access, several organizations are already building new API services based on the
[Oracle Data](/oracles/oracle-data) available after the migration. These organizations include (but
not limited to), [Hotspotty](https://hotspotty.net), [HeliumGeek](https://heliumgeek.com),
[Relay](https://www.relaydevice.com) and [Watchium](https://watchium.disk91.com).
