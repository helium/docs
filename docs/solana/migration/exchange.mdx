:::warning 🚧 This document is a work in progress. 🚧

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

The Helium Network is migrating to the Solana blockchain. All Helium Network Tokens (HNT, IOT, and
MOBILE), will become [Solana SPL](https://spl.solana.com/token) tokens.

If an exchange already supports SPL tokens, follow the steps below.

:::tip SPL token Support

Please refer to the Solana Documentation on how to
[Add Solana to Your Exchange](https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange) for details.

## Mint IDs

All Helium Network Tokens are available on the
[`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA)
program, and mint IDs exist both on `mainnet-beta` and `devnet` for testing.

The mint IDs are as follows:

| Name   | ID                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| HNT    | hntyVP6YFm1Hg25TN9WGLqM12b8TQmcknKrdu1oxWux |
| MOBILE | mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6 |

## Mapping Helium Wallets to Solana Wallets

Helium wallets use the same ED25519 curve as Solana wallets, resulting in Helium public keys and
secret keys mapping directly to Solana wallets.

You can either migrate you wallet using this widget:

import { MigrateWallet } from '@theme/MigrateWallet'

<MigrateWallet />

Or continue reading for manual instructions:

### JavaScript

To get the Solana public key equivalent of a Helium public key in javascript run:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import Address from "@helium/address";
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js"

const addr = Address.fromB58("...helium pubkey...");

// Gets the solana pubkey
new PublicKey(addr.publicKey).toBase58()
```

To get a Solana equivalent `Keypair` from a Helium `Keypair`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import { Keypair } from "@helium/crypto";
import { Keypair as SolanaKeypair } from "@solana/web3.js"

const solanaKeypair = SolanaKeypair.fromSecretKey(heliumKeypair.privateKey);
```

### Rust

In rust, to get a pubkey:

```rust
let helium_pubkey_bytes = helium_pubkey.to_vec();

let solana_pubkey = solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey::new(&helium_pubkey_bytes[1..]);
println!("solana public key: {}", solana_pubkey);
```

To map a keypair:

```rust
solana_sdk::signature::Keypair::from_bytes(helium_keypair.secret_to_vec())
```

:::tip Migration API

The Migration API can be used to retrieve the Solana wallet address from a Helium wallet address.

## Wallet Migration

Wallets will need to be inflated on Solana. In essence this is recreating the wallet's Helium state
on Solana.

The
[migration-service](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/tree/master/packages/migration-service)
can be used to migrate wallet(s) to Solana.

For the Helium Wallet App users, the wallet requests the migration-service to get the needed
transaction and submits them to the Solana blockchain when the app is opened for the first time
after the Migration is complete.

Since exchange wallets may not use the wallet app, the migration service can instead be used
directly by following the below steps:

For devnet:

1. Get the Solana wallet address from a Helium wallet address:
   `https://migration.web.test-helium.com/helium/*helium-wallet-address*`

2. Get the list of serialized transactions, which should be sent to Solana:
   `https://migration.web.test-helium.com/migrate/*solana-wallet-address*?limit=1000&offset=0`

3. Submit the transactions to Solana. You can see typescript code demonstrating how to use this
   [here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/blob/master/packages/migration-service/src/test-submit.ts#L37).

   Note: Each transaction is only allowed to execute once.

Alternatively, you can use the
[command line utility](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/releases/tag/v0.0.27-migration-cli)
for steps 2-3.

```
$ env MIGRATION_SERVICE_URL=https://migration.web.test-helium.com env SOLANA_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com env SOLANA_WSS_URL=wss://api.devnet.solana.com ./migration-tx-executor --wallet *your-solana-wallet*
```

## Trustless Wallet Migration

The tools listed above are convenient but rely on the migration service provided by the Helium
Foundation.

The on-chain implementation of the migration is trustless, and the full state of the Helium
blockchain will be converted to a list of Solana transactions and compressed into a Merkle Tree root
on Solana.

Any entity providing the proper proof that the provided transactions are valid can execute the
transactions to inflate a wallet. Each transaction is only allowed to execute once.

An example transaction is viewable here:

If you would like a copy of the database serving the proofs for the migration service, please
[contact the Helium Foundation](mailto:hello@helium.foundation).

This database copy can be used to run an instance of the
[migration service](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/tree/master/packages/migration-service)
