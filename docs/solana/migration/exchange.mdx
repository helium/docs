:::warning ðŸš§ This document is a work in progress. ðŸš§

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

Helium will be transitioning from its own L1 to Solana. The proceedure for Helium should be the same
as the proceedure for all other Solana SPL Tokens.

## Blockchain Integration

If an exchange already supports [Solana SPL](https://spl.solana.com/token) tokens, follow the steps
below.

Otherwise, please refer to the Solana Documentation on how to
[Add Solana to Your Exchange](https://docs.solana.com/integrations/exchange) for details.

## Mint IDs

All the tokens are on the
[`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` program](https://explorer.solana.com/address/TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA).

The mint IDs are as follows:

| Name   | ID                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| HNT    | hntyVP6YFm1Hg25TN9WGLqM12b8TQmcknKrdu1oxWux |
| MOBILE | mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6 |
| IOT    | iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns |
| DC     | dcuc8Amr83Wz27ZkQ2K9NS6r8zRpf1J6cvArEBDZDmm |

These mint IDs exist both on `mainnet-beta` and `devnet` for testing.

## Mapping Helium Wallets to Solana Wallets

Helium wallets use the same ED25519 curve as Solana wallets. This means that Helium public keys and
secret keys can be mapped directly to a Solana based wallet.

To get the Solana public key equivalent of a Helium public key, in javascript you can run:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import Address from "@helium/address";
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js"

const addr = Address.fromB58("...helium pubkey...");

// Gets the solana pubkey
new PublicKey(addr.publicKey).toBase58()
```

To get a Solana equivalent `Keypair` from a Helium `Keypair`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import { Keypair } from "@helium/crypto";
import { Keypair as SolanaKeypair } from "@solana/web3.js"

const solanaKeypair = SolanaKeypair.fromSecretKey(heliumKeypair.privateKey);
```

In rust, to get a pubkey:

```rust
let helium_pubkey_bytes = helium_pubkey.to_vec();

let solana_pubkey = solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey::new(&helium_pubkey_bytes[1..]);
println!("solana public key: {}", solana_pubkey);
```

To map a keypair:

```rust
solana_sdk::signature::Keypair::from_bytes(helium_keypair.secret_to_vec())
```

You can also get the Solana wallet address from a Helium wallet address using the migration api:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/helium/*helium-wallet-address*`

### Migration

To migrate wallet(s) to Solana, you can use the migration service. Instead of sending all
transactions to inflate Helium state on Solana during the transition period, transactions are
instead processed as needed. When a user opens their wallet in the Helium Wallet App, it requests
the migration service to get the needed transactions, then submits them to Solana.

Since exchange wallets may not use the wallet app, the service can be used directly:

For devnet:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/migrate/*solana-wallet-address*?limit=1000&offset=0`

This will get the list of serialized transactions, which should be sent to Solana.

To get the Solana wallet address from a Helium wallet address, call:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/helium/*helium-wallet-address*`

You can also use the command line utility from
[here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/releases/tag/v0.0.27-migration-cli).

```
$ env MIGRATION_SERVICE_URL=https://migration.web.test-helium.com env SOLANA_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com env SOLANA_WSS_URL=wss://api.devnet.solana.com ./migration-tx-executor --wallet *your-solana-wallet*
```

You can see typescript code demonstrating how to use this
[here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/blob/master/packages/migration-service/src/test-submit.ts#L37).

## Trustless Wallet Migration

While the above tools are convenient, they rely on our migration service. Luckily, the on-chain
implementation of the migration is trustless. The full state of the Helium chain was converted to a
list of Solana transactions and then compressed into a merkle root on Solana. This means that anyone
can execute the transactions to inflate a wallet so long as they provide a proper proof that the
provided transactions are valid. Each transaction is only allowed to be executed once.

We can see one such transaction here:

https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5Y8vfMAfhyqgXsp1YnvPVHMdK4PUryLqMCgGynQXg9tPkUVehK438XviXz3ciSkg4PhqMZ8UyrSSVj7pgY8uq1xr?cluster=devnet

If you would like a copy of the database serving the proofs for the migration service, please
[contact the Helium Foundation](mailto:hello@helium.foundation). You can then run your own instance
of the
[migration service](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/tree/master/packages/migration-service)
