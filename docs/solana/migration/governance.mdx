:::warning 🚧 This document is a work in progress. 🚧

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

[Helium Vote](https://helium.vote) will transition to using
[Solana SPL Governance Realms](https://app.realms.today/).

While the user interface will change, the governance process will remain mostly the same.

Using the Helium Wallet App, users will use an embedded browser to visit
[helium.vote](https://helium.vote), connect a wallet, and vote yes/no on proposals. Ledger users, or
users of any other Solana wallet, can also navigate to [helium.vote](https://helium.vote), connect a
wallet, and vote.

## Governance Changes

The major change with Solana governance is that more of the Helium network can be governed by the
DAO. Everything from Program (smart contract) changes to approving Makers can now controlled by the
DAO.
