As the miner image transitions to being a gateway-rs-only container, it will stop obeying settings
from the `sys.config` file that most Hotspot Makers use to notify the miner instance of Hotspot
settings. To help Makers with this transition, a list of common configuration items that were
previously configured via `sys.config` are provided along with alternates that will work for
gateway-rs. These configuration items can be set when invoking the miner container or when running
gateway-rs as a stand-alone executable.

## Gateway-rs Configuration

At startup, gateway-rs configures itself via two methods: from environment variables and from a
`settings.toml` file. By default, the settings file will be expected in the location
`/etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml`, but this can be overridden with the `-c` flag. However, it is
not recommended that Makers replace the default `settings.toml` file as it contains other important
key items that may change from time to time. Instead, we recommend that Makers supply any necessary
override items via _environment variables_.

In general, any item in the `settings.toml` file can be overridden by supplying an environment
variable to gateway-rs with a name that is similar to the setting being overridden by prefixing the
settings keyword with the characters `GW_`.

:::note Example

To override the `keypair` item in `settings.toml` with the value `example://override`, supply the
environment variable `GW_KEYPAIR=example://override` to gateway-rs at startup.

:::

_Note:_ Previous versions of gateway-rs included both a `default.toml` and `settings.toml`. All
configurations are now only made in `settings.toml`.

### Quick Reference Summary

These are the configuration variables to migrate from miner to gateway-rs:

| Erlang Source | Erlang Variable      | gateway-rs Environment                     | Default Value    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `sys.config`  | `miner:radio_device` | [`GW_LISTEN`](#packet-forwarder-bind-port) | `127.0.0.1:1680` |
| `sys.config`  | `miner:jsonrpc_port` | `GW_API`                                   | `127.0.0.1:4467` |
| `sys.config`  | `blockchain:key`     | [`GW_KEYPAIR`](#key-configuration)         | None             |
| Environment   | `REGION_OVERRIDE`    | [`GW_REGION`](#radio-region)               | None             |

### Key Configuration

Like the miner, gateway-rs requires a cryptographic key to identify and authenticate itself on the
Helium Network. Most Makers have likely relied on the default miner key settings, which instructed
the miner to use the cryptographic identity locked in slot 0 of an ECC608 chip on I2C bus #1 at I2C
address `0x60`/96. For these Makers this old default would have sufficed.

Unlike the miner, however, gateway-rs does not have any default key setting. Therefore, as a Maker
you must specifically provide gateway-rs with an appropriate setting for your platform.

If your platform deviated from the miner defaults, then you are likely familiar with the settings
that had to be adjusted in the `blockchain:key` override in sys.config. But, for the sake of
completeness, we'll illustrate all the settings that could have been adjusted in that scheme and
show how they are encoded in the scheme used by gateway-rs.

For example, if the Erlang miner had been configured with:

```
{ blockchain, [
    { key,
        { ecc, [
            {key_slot, 2},
            {onboarding_key_slot, 12},
            {bus, "i2c-5"},
            {address, 83}
        ]}
    }
]}
```

Then the equivalent gateway-rs ECC608 configuration would be via these two environment variables:

```
GW_KEYPAIR=ecc://i2c-5:83?slot=2
GW_ONBOARDING=ecc://i2c-5:83?slot=12
```

### Radio Region

The region variable is the default region used when the Hotspot does not have an asserted location.
Makers need to ensure that the region is set correctly for the region in which the Hotspot is sold
to ensure correct beaconing behavior.

Under the miner regime, the default radio region was adjusted via the `REGION` environment variable.
In gateway-rs it is specified via the `GW_REGION` environment variable.

For example, if the Erlang miner had been configured to use the US915 region by default:

```
REGION=US915
```

Then the equivalent gateway-rs configuration would be via the environment variable:

```
GW_REGION=US915
```

### Packet Forwarder Bind Port

The default address at which gateway-rs listens for UDP packets from the packet forwarder has not
changed (host `127.0.0.1`, port 1680). However, if you need to change the host or port binding from
this default then you will need to supply a `GW_LISTEN` environment variable.

For example, if the Erlang miner had been configured with:

```
{miner, [ {
        {radio_device, {{0, 0, 0, 0}, 1699, deprecated, deprecated}}
```

then the equivalent gateway-rs configuration would be via the environment variable:

```
GW_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:1699
```

## Logging

Before the migration, miner handled writing logs to disk. Post migration, helium_gateway outputs on
`stdout` as it has before. It is up to the Maker to integrate with their system's logging setup.
Capturing log output and writing to disk may be handled with a log manager such as `journald` or
`syslogd`.

## CLI

The CLI has changed for a few commands, notably the `helium_gateway info` command that some makers
may use now takes a list of info entries to return. The `helium_gateway info --help` output
documents what keys are available.

## System Startup

Since gateway-rs no longer releases as an installable package it is up to the maker to integrate the
executable with their system startup setups, (like procd or tini, systemd depending on the operating
system setup)

## Firewall Configurations

Makers using outbound firewall rules to restrict outbound connections should allow the following
outbound ports:

| Purpose               | Outbound Port Used |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Configuration Service | TCP/6080           |
| Entropy Oracle        | TCP/7080           |
| Packet Router         | TCP/8080           |
| Packet Ingest         | TCP/9080           |
