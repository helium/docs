## Derivation Paths and your new Public Key

The Helium Ledger App uses `ED25519`` keys, similarly to Solana, but at a different derivation path.

This means that, while seed phrases are the same, private keys are different on Solana.

In order to get around this, when you run the migration, the migration application will ask you to
use the old derivation path to approve sending all of your Hotspots, tokens, etc to the new
derivation path.
