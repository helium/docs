:::info Using the Helium Solana Ledger App

More information on installing and using the Solana-compatible Helium app for Ledger Wallets in the
[Github Repo](https://github.com/helium/app-helium-solana).

:::

The following utility will migrate all tokens from the Helium derivation path `44'/904'/n'/0'` to
the Solana derivation path `44'/501'/n'/0'`. To get started, install the:

Ledger users will need to update their Helium Ledger App to a version that's pending release. This
upcoming version will use the Solana private key derivation path that moves all your tokens and
balances over to Solana. You may need to uninstall any Solana Ledger Apps during the Wallet
migration process.

## Migration Tool

Your public key will change on Solana but the private key will remain the same.

- [Helium Solana Ledger App](https://github.com/helium/app-helium-solana) from Github
- [Solana Ledger App](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016265659-Solana-SOL-?support=true)
  using Ledger Live

import { LedgerMigration } from '@theme/LedgerMigration'

## Derivation Paths and your new Public Key

The Helium Ledger App uses `ED25519` keys, similarly to Solana, but at a different derivation path.

This means that, while seed phrases are the same, private keys are different on Solana.

In order to get around this, when you run the migration, the migration application will ask you to
use the old derivation path to approve sending all of your Hotspots, tokens, etc to the new
derivation path.
