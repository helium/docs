The Solana Migration Status service can be leveraged in order to appropriately feature flag 
attributes in an application. For example, this service can be used to disable transactions during 
the migration or to point users to separate services as the migration completes.

## Migration States

The three possible values that may be returned by the API represent different stages of the 
migration process:

- **`not_started`**: This means that the migration process has not yet begun. The Helium blockchain 
is still operating and the migration to Solana has not yet been initiated.
- **`in_progress`**: This means that the migration process is currently underway. The Helium 
blockchain is in the process of being migrated to Solana. The Helium Blockchain will be halted 
during this process. Proof of Coverage and Data Transfer activity continue to function throughout 
the migration process.
- **`complete`**: This means that the migration process has been completed successfully. The Helium 
blockchain has been migrated to Solana. The `finalBlockHeight` value will update from 
`null` to the final block height of the Helium Blockchain.


## Example Usage

```bash
curl https://solana-status.helium.com

  "migrationStatus": "not_started",
  "minimumVersions": {
    "com.helium.wallet.app": "2.0.0"
  },
