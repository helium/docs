:::warning ðŸš§ This document is a work in progress. ðŸš§

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

As a LoRaWAN Network user, you will not need to do anything during the migration. The network should
continue to function.

<!-- TODO: Joey, maybe talk about Chirpstack and such? -->
