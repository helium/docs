Important notes:

- Helium L1 Validators are no longer required after the transition to Solana
- Staking HNT has been replaced with lock-up of HNT to establish a veHNT position
- Validator stakes will be automatically be migrated to veHNT positions during the transition
- Acton must be taken to return the HNT (unstake) from a veHNT position
- Action must be taken to delegate veHNT to a network and enable MOBILE and IOT emissions.

Validators were critical for the ongoing operation of the Helium Network and will continue to earn
HNT rewards for their role in supporting the Helium ecosystem until the moment of the L1 transition
to Solana completion.

Validators maintained the Network and provided vital operations, including validating transactions
and producing blocks from which all Network participants benefit. One of the impacts of the passing
of HIP-70 and transitioning L1 is that the role Validators play as we know it will no longer be
required, and Validators are sunsetted by the end of April 18th 2023 after the transition is
complete.

After 00:00:00 UTC on the 19th of April unless notified otherwise on the Helium Discord Validators
can be turned off.

Validators who remained staked receive new vote escrowed HNT (veHNT) based on their staked HNT
amount and lock-up period. Your HNT will become veHNT and remain entirely in your wallet's custody.
veHNT ownership is represented by a non transferable Solana NFT held in your wallet.

Post-transition, veHNT will be the only way to vote in the Helium Network and to receive an income
in Tokens for locking up tokens for a period of time

Holding veHNT means you, the wallet holder, have the opportunity to influence the future of the
Helium Network, and the more voting weight you have, the more influence you can use.

Delegating the veHNT in your wallet allows the wallet holder to receive a daily income of the subDAO
token that the veHNT is delegated to.

## Key Take Aways​

- Until the Solana transition is completed, staked Validators continue to earn HNT rewards for block
  production.
- veHNT gives holders voting rights to determine the future of the Helium Network.
- Validators who remain staked receive a 3x veHNT bonus for staked HNT, and their HNT remains locked
  up for the six-month period as defined in HIP 51.
- Stakers will no longer receive an income in HNT tokens.
- veHNT holders will earn MOBILE or IOT tokens depending on which Helium subDAO they delegate their
  veHNT.
- HNT can be released back to the validator owner's wallet after the minimum 6 month lock-up period
  after staking cooldown is selected.

## Common Questions

### What Is veHNT?​

veHNT represents the voting power of the Helium Network. It does not have a fiat value.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking their HNT on-chain for a specified
period in exchange for voting power and subDAO Delegation income in the HeliumDAO as defined in
HIP-51.After the lock-up period ends, the same amount of HNT is released back to the owner's wallet
and is now transferable, if needed.

This provides the ability to earn other tokens such as MOBILE or IOT, if the holder delegates their
veHNT to those subDAOs, respectively. Staking income in HNT will cease.

veHNT allows those willing to stake or lock-up their HNT for periods of time a return in Helium
tokens similar to staking with validators did previously. The difference is that veHNT allows a
calculated percentage return in subDAO tokens rather than a lottery based consensus group return in
HNT.

### What Was Validator Staked HNT Staking Rewards?​

Following HIP-25, Validator operators staked 10,000 HNT into a Validator Node. HNT holders could
stake multiple Validators if they chose to do so. The work of block production moved to Validator
nodes, and those elected periodically into the Consensus Group received 6% of HNT emissions as a
reward for block production.

Validators served two roles in the Network, block production and creating and validating
Proof-of-Coverage challenges. Validators earned 6% of emissions for block production when elected to
the Consensus Group and 0.85% for Proof-of-Coverage challenges.

### How Will Staking Rewards Change with veHNT?​

As of 02/02/23, the Challenger role was removed from Validators as Hotspots begin to beacon
independently of be challenged. The PoC Challenger rewards pool has been returned to Hotspots.

After HIP-70's L1 transition is implemented, the existing Validators will no longer be producing
blocks for the Helium Network and will no longer receive HNT rewards. As their staked HNT will be
converted to veHNT, these holders can optionally delegate to specific subDAOs.

Currently, the IOT and MOBILE subDAO have a 6% token emission pool for veHNT stakers.

After HIP-51, HIP-52 and HIP-53 are implemented, all the subDAOs combined will receive the non-HST
emissions of HNT. At this time, this is 68% of emitted HNT and will increase to 69% at the next
yearly emissions change in August 2023. This emissions curve changes annually such that the subDAOs
eventually receive 85% of all future HNT emissions.

Previously Validator stakers had a validator performance based randomized chance at 6% of the daily
HNT distribution of HNT. Now they have a share of 6% of the 68% of the HNT distributed to subDAOs
based on how much HNT for how long they are willing to lock-up that HNT for.

### What Happens to my HNT Previously Staked in a Pool?​

Staking Pool providers have all made an effort to contact their customers to return the HNT that was
staked in a pool, Contact the vendor managing your staking pool for more detailed information if you
have not received your HNT back.

:::caution As a Reminder

**The Helium Foundation is neither responsible for nor manages the status of Validator staking
pools.**

### How much veHNT will validators receive?

On 18th of April all validators still staked or in cooldown will automatically convert to veHNT with
a six-month staking release date. as described in HIP-70

Each validator will receive 375,000 veHNT as a veHNT position for 6 months with rolling lock-up -
referred to as constant lock-up

This amount is calculated as 10,000 HNT x 12.5 multiplier for 6 months lock-up x 3 for the Landrush
bonus (for early veHNT investors).

If you have multiple validators then you will receive all the veHNT for each validator you have as a
single large veHNT position.

### Can I transfer my veHNT to another wallet?

No you cannot transfer your veHNT to another wallet, but you can transfer out of one veHNT position
into another position within the same wallet.

### What Is a "Lock-Up" Period?​

A lock-up period is a window of time when users are not allowed to transfer their HNT.

You will incur a lock-up period when you stake your HNT for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 1
day and 48 months selectable in days but with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help incentivize long-term holders of HNT and deter short-term speculators and those
with shorter-term interests in the governance of the Network.

The amount of veHNT received for a lock-up period can be seen in this table
https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/validators/validators-and-voting-power/#how-much-vehnt-will-i-get-for-each-lock-up-period

### The Landrush period

For the first ten days after Helium's transition onto Solana, there will be a 3x multiplier bonus
for new veHNT stakers which includes validator owners migrating from Staked HNT to veHNT. This is
called the "Landrush" multiplier.

New stakers are only eligible to receive this veHNT bonus during the initial seven-day Landrush
period. HNT staked after this period will receive veHNT at the normal rate with no multiplier.

This landrush period will end at 23:59:59 UTC time on 28th April 2023

```
For example:

Staking 10,000 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of six months gets 375,000 veHNT (10,000x12.5x3) that if cooldown is selected decays from 375,000 to 0 veHNT at the end of the staking period, and 10,000 HNT is returned to the wallet.

Increasing to stake 20,000 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of 24 months returns 3,000,000 veHNT (20,000x50x3), and at the end of the staking period, 20,000 HNT is returned to the wallet.
```

Validator owners can also take advantage of the 10 day bonus period and get the 3x bonus reapplied
if they extend their default 6 month lock-up period. This 3x bonus will not apply to the later
extended period if they extend the lock-up further after the initial seven days, or veHNT is
transfered to another staking position after the 10 day period.

### What should all validator operators plan to do.

- Arrange to turn off validators after 00:00:00 UTC on 19th April
- Load any wallets owning staked validators into the Helium Wallet App.
- If Validators are staked with HNT on a Ledger, migrate the Ledger Wallet
- Decide if you want to take back your HNT or not.
- Decide if you want to top-up your veHNT position with more HNT.
- Decide if you want to lock-up all or part of your veHNT for longer than 6 months.
- Decide what subDAO or subDAO split to delegate your veHNT to.

### What if I do nothing about my Validator Stake?

If a validator owner does "nothing" then the stake will transfer over to be veHNT automatically.

The owner will receive 375,000 veHNT per validator they own in their wallet as a single position

This will not not enter a cooldown period and they will never receive their HNT back until they
enter the wallet and select the cooldown option from within the Realms.today governance link.

After selecting cooldown they will get their 10,000 HNT per validator back in 183 days (6 months)
after the date of the cooldown selection.

They will no longer receive any income in HNT, from the date of transition.

They will need to delegate their veHNT to either IOT or MOBILE (They can split it if desired) to
earn an income in IOT or MOBILE tokens.

They can have multiple positions of veHNT delegated to different subDAOs or for different lock-up
periods.

Each position of veHNT can delegate all or nothing of the veHNT.

The validator server can be turned off at any point after 00:00:00 UTC on 19th April

### What if I want my HNT back?

The stake will transfer over to be veHNT.

The owner will receive 375,000 veHNT per validator they own in their wallet as a single position

The validator owner will need to select the cooldown option from within the Realms.today governance
link on that position from within the Helium Wallet App

After selecting cooldown they will get their 10,000 HNT per validator back in 183 days (6 months)
after the date of the cooldown selection. This is like the 250,000 block cooldown period validators
previously had.

They will no longer receive any income in HNT, from the date of transition.

They can delegate their veHNT to either IOT or MOBILE (They can split it if desired) to earn a
linear decreasing income in IOT or MOBILE tokens while in cooldown.

They can have multiple positions of veHNT delegated to different subDAOs or for different lock-up
periods. Each position of veHNT can delegate all or nothing of the veHNT.

### Ledger Wallet Migration.

Any validator staked from HNT held on Ledger hardware wallets using the Helium App will need to be
migrated to the Solana App using the Helium Solana migration app

The latest information on the procedure and Leger App status is on
[https://docs.helium.com/solana/migration/ledger](https://docs.helium.com/solana/migration/ledger)

### “Top-up” of veHNT Positions

You can “top-up” your 375,000 per validator stake with more HNT from a minimum of 1 HNT and this
must be added to an existing position or transferred from a position of lesser lock-up time.

Positions started within the Landrush Period cannot be topped-up AFTER the Landrush period. They can
be topped up within the landrush period.

### Why hold Multiple veHNT positions ?

It is highly recommended that previous validator owners and large HNT stakers split their single
position received after the transition into several smaller positions immediately upon lock-up and
when applicable within 10 days after the Solana transition.ie before 23:59:59 UTC on 28th April.

This is because subDAO delegation of veHNT is a 0 or 100% all or nothing action.

- Splitting veHNT across multiple subDAOs requires multiple positions.
- Splitting veHNT over different lock-up periods requires multiple positions.
- Splitting veHNT with some in constant lockup and some in cooldown requires multiple positions.

Splitting positions after the 28th of April would mean that the veHNT transferred to the new part of
the split does not inherit the 3x bonus multiplier.As this bonus multiplier only applies to
positions

Splitting as an action is simply transferring some of the veHNT in one position to another new or
existing position. S

veHNT owners may want to frequently vary their split of subDAO delegations and lock-up periods to
suit their own personal situations and the variance of the HNT per subDAO emitted based on the DAO
utility scores.

### Can I Increase My Staking Lock-up Period At Any Time?​

Yes. You can increase your lock-up period to the maximum of 48 months at any time, and each increase
activates at the start of the next epoch. If the veHNT is delegated you must undelegate, change the
period and redelegate and lose delegation rewards within that 24 hour Epoch. If those three actions
take longer than an epoch or are split over two epochs then delegation rewards are lost for two
Epochs.

### Can I Decrease My Staking Period For Fast Access to My HNT and Take a Penalty?​

No. You define your lock-up period at the time of staking and cannot unstake or decrease the lock-up
period for any reason.

### Can I Automate Re-Staking?​

Yes a constant rolling lock-up period will be the default option called Constant Lock-up. The decay
countdown start point will be positive action needed to start the lock-up cooldown period.

Validator owners will be automatically staked for 6 years with a Constant lockup.

### How to Choose a subDAO to Stake?​

HIP-51 defines that all subDAOs return a maximum of 6% of their earnings to their veHNT delegators
and is designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subDAOs so that no subDAO can buy
their way to a higher DAO Utility score.

Returns can be lower than 6% in subDAO tokens if the subDAO votes to provide a lower token return in
return for other benefits or similar.

As more veHNT is delegated to a subDAO, the DAO Utility Score improves, among other factors defined
in HIP-51, which drives greater earnings of HNT for the subDAO.

As more veHNT holders delegate to a particular subDAO, individual holder earnings will reduce the
amount of net subDAO token earnings as delegators share the 6% subDAO token emissions.

The more veHNT delegated to a subDAO the more the subDAO Utility score increases and the more HNT
the subDAO gets at each epoch improving the HNT/subDAO Token ratio. But the more veHNT delegated,
the more veHNT holders the 6% will have to be shared between.

### Will My subDAO Earnings Remain The Same Over The Time Period Lock-Up?​

No, they are calculated and paid to the lock-up position per epoch - daily. They may increase when:

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your treasury gets more HNT.
- More Hotspot onboarding fees are burned in the subDAO you delegated to.
- More data is transferred and burned in the subDAO you delegated to.

They may decrease when:

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your share is reduced
- More veHNT is delegated to other subDAOs - other treasuries get more HNT.
- Your delegated veHNT decays over time after you entered cooldown.
- More Hotspots are online in other subDAOs with a non zero onboarding fee.
- More data is transferred and burned in other subDAOs.

Thus it can be observed that delegating more or all of your veHNT to a specific subDAO has the
opportunity to both increase or decrease your subDAO earnings from delegation.
