This guide provides step-by-step instructions for Helium app, Helium Wallet app, CLI Wallet, and
Ledger Wallet users to migrate their wallets to the Solana blockchain.

Wallet migration is necessary to interact with your HNT, DC, MOBILE, IOT, and Hotspots on the Solana
blockchain. You can find Hotspot NFTs in the NFT Collectibles section once Helium on Solana goes
live. Token balances are visible on the account page. You can also create or import multiple
accounts to a maxium of 10 on the Helium Wallet app.

## For Helium App Users

> The [Helium Hotspot App](/mine-hnt/helium-hotspot-app) will require a migration to the
> [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

To start, ensure your Helium app is updated and that you have downloaded the latest Helium Wallet
app v2 or higher.

Your public Wallet address will change post-migration, but your private key and 12-word seed phrase
will remain the same.

## For Helium Wallet App Users

> Some users may know the Helium Wallet app as the "New Wallet app" or "the black app."

To migrate to Solana, simply update your Helium Wallet app version to 2.0.0 or newer. That’s it!

If you have Hotspots in any account, they will appear as an NFT Collectable. All other tokens and
their balances are automatically transferred to the Solana Blockchain under the same token name.

Your public Wallet address will change, but your private key and seed phrase (12 or 24 word) will
remain the same.

---

## For CLI Wallet Users

:::caution The Helium CLI Wallet Will Be Depreciated

The CLI Wallet will be completely deprecated except for exporting private seed phrases and
displaying public Solana addresses.

Check out the [Solana Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli) for more information
on Solana Command Line Wallets.

:::

The CLI Wallet will have its feature set pared down as there are many other Solana-compatible CLI
Wallets. The existing Helium CLI Wallet will be reduced to the following two functions:

1. Export Seed Phrase or private key to import into a Solana CLI Wallet (or the Helium Wallet app)
2. Display Solana Public Address (for a given set of private keys)

This means common payment transactions and staking should utilize
[Solana CLI Wallet](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli) or the Helium Wallet app.

---

## For Ledger Wallet Users

Ledger users will need to update their Helium Ledger App to a version that's pending release. This
upcoming version will use the Solana private key derivation path that moves all your tokens and
balances over to Solana. You may need to uninstall any Solana Ledger Apps during the Wallet
migration process.

Your public key will change on Solana but the private key will remain the same.

The [Ledger Migration](/solana/migration/ledger) document includes the utilities needed to update
your Helium Ledger account.

### Derivation Paths and your new Public Key

The Helium Ledger App uses `ED25519` keys, similarly to Solana, but at a different derivation path.

This means that, while seed phrases are the same, private keys are different on Solana.

In order to get around this, when you run the migration, the migration application will ask you to
use the old derivation path to approve sending all of your Hotspots, tokens, etc to the new
derivation path.
