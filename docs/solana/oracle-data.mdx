The Helium Network operates Oracles that perform various tasks backing Proof of Coverage and data
transfer for the LoRaWAN (IoT), Mobile, and any future networks. These Oracles provide extensive
logs for the purposes of analysis of the Helium subDAOs.

The Helium Oracles handle all data about the network with the exception of transactions handled by
the [Helium Program Libraries](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library) on Solana.

## Accessing Oracle Data

### AWS S3 Buckets

Data is directly accessible from the `foundation-poc-data-requester-pays` bucket in AWS `us-west-2` 
under the top level data category prefixes listed below. All data provided in the S3 bucket is 
made available on a basis of 'Requestor Pays' meaning you, the requester, will pay for the data 
transfer and API costs incurred from the data requests. For more information on accessing data from 
a requester pays bucket, refer to [Downloading objects in Requester Pays buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html).

   | Top Level Data Category Prefixes |
   | -------------------------------- |
   | `foundation-iot-entropy`         |
   | `foundation-iot-ingest`          |
   | `foundation-iot-packet-ingest`   |
   | `foundation-iot-packet-verifier` |
   | `foundation-verified-rewards`    |
   | `foundation-mobile-ingest`       |
   | `foundation-mobile-verified`     |

Under each top level data category prefix, the relating PoC data files are provided in a flattened 
structure in the format provided below:

`s3://foundation-poc-data-requester-pays/<top-level-data-category-prefix>/<filename>.gz`

Again, as the `foundation-poc-data-requester-pays` bucket is 'Requestor Pays', you should be mindful 
that AWS will charge you for:

1. Storage costs on any destination buckets
2. Egress fees if the data leaves `us-west-2`
3. `PUT`, `COPY`, `POST`, `LIST` requests

To that end, keeping data in `us-west-2` and being pragmatic about which AWS S3 access patterns you
use will greatly reduce your cost burden for accessing the PoC data.

In regard to access patterns, one approach that you can take to minimize the quantity of S3 API 
calls over time - and save money - is to use the `aws s3api list-objects-v2` command and specify
the `--start-after` parameter with the filename of the last file you received, as indicated below:

```bash
aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket foundation-poc-data-requester-pays --prefix <top-level-data-category-prefix> --start-after <filename> --request-payer requester
```

For example, if you were to execute the `aws s3api list-objects-v2` command and the last / most 
recent file you received was `example.gz`, in a subsequent call to `aws s3api list-objects-v2` you 
could add the `--start-after example.gz` flag to return a list of files subsequent to `example.gz`. 
In doing so, your total API calls in the second invocation of `aws s3api list-objects-v2` would be 
limited to only the files subsequent to `example.gz`, rather than for all files in the bucket. From
there, you can iterate over the returned list of files and perform additional S3 API commands such 
as `aws s3api copy-object` to copy files based on the file list.

The raw PoC data stored in the `foundation-poc-data-requester-pays` bucket is in encoded protobuf
format in gz compressed files. The table below provides the top level data category prefixes, the 
file types comprised within each data category prefix, the filename pattern for each file type, and 
provides a link to the corresponding protobuf used to decode the data.

### Arweave

_**Planned:**_ In the interest of providing a decentralized option for data access all Oracle data
is additionally replicated to [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org). This provides a data access option
that does not require egress fees. Arweave implementation will be accompanied by relevant access
patterns.

## Reading Bytestream Data

In order to store the massive amount of data generated by the Oracles, the output is stored as
zipped bytestreams. In order to 'unpack' this data, you'll need the associated protobuf from
[github.com/helium/proto](https://github.com/helium/proto).

<!--TODO: list the specific protos used for each file type  -->

## Service Providers

Several Helium ecosystem companies are building interfaces around Oracle data. These services range
from APIs to Oracle data explorers
