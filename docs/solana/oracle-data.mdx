The Helium Network operates Oracles that perform various tasks backing Proof of Coverage and data
transfer for the LoRaWAN (IoT), Mobile, and any future networks. These Oracles provide extensive
logs for the purposes of analysis of the Helium subDAOs.

The Helium Oracles handle all data about the network with the exception of transactions handled by
the [Helium Program Libraries](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library) on Solana.

## Accessing Oracle Data

### AWS S3 Buckets

Data is directly accessible from the `foundation-poc-data-requester-pays` bucket in AWS `us-west-2` 
under the top level data category prefixes listed below. All data provided in the S3 bucket is 
made available on a basis of 'Requestor Pays' meaning you, the requester, will pay for the data 
transfer and API costs incurred from the data requests. For more information on accessing data from 
a requester pays bucket, refer to [Downloading objects in Requester Pays buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html).

   | Top Level Data Category Prefixes |
   | -------------------------------- |
   | `foundation-iot-entropy`         |
   | `foundation-iot-ingest`          |
   | `foundation-iot-packet-ingest`   |
   | `foundation-iot-packet-verifier` |
   | `foundation-verified-rewards`    |
   | `foundation-mobile-ingest`       |
   | `foundation-mobile-verified`     |

Under each data category prefix, the relating PoC data is segmented into `historical` and `<date>` 
sub-prefixes, where `<date>` is in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, starting from February 19th, 2023 onward. 
For example, PoC data produced each day is comprised within a sub-prefix of `YYYY-MM-DD` format, so 
data produced on February 20th, 2023 will be under a `2023-02-20` sub-prefix, data produced on 
February 21st, 2023 will be under a `2023-02-21` sub-prefix, and so on. Any data produced before 
February 19th, 2023 is stored under the `historical` prefix. The data flowing into the buckets is 
occurring in near-real time. 

The file structure noted above is used to provide more cost efficient access patterns 
when retrieving raw PoC data from S3. Be mindful that AWS will charge you for:

1. Storage costs on any destination buckets.
2. Egress fees if the data leaves `us-west-2`.
3. `PUT`, `COPY`, `POST`, `LIST` requests. To that end, keeping data in `us-west-2` and using the
   **`aws s3 cp`** (rather than `aws s3 sync` command) will save you significant money over time.

Accordingly, by using any of the example `aws s3 ls`, `aws s3 cp`, or `aws s3 sync` commands listed 
below, S3 API call cost overhead will be limited to the sub-prefix, rather than encompassing the 
total file quanity comprised within the top level data category prefixes. 

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://foundation-poc-data-requester-pays/<top_level_data_category_prefix>/<historical|date>/ --request-payer
```

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://foundation-poc-data-requester-pays/<top_level_data_category_prefix>/<historical|date>/ s3://<dest_bucket_name> --recursive --request-payer
```

```bash
aws s3 sync s3://foundation-poc-data-requester-pays/<top_level_data_category_prefix>/<historical|date>/ s3://<dest_bucket_name> --request-payer
```

The raw PoC data stored in the `foundation-poc-data-requester-pays` bucket is in encoded protobuf
format. The table below provies the top level data category prefixes, the file types comprised 
within each data category prefix, the filename pattern for each file type, and provides a link to 
the corresponding protobuf used to decode the data.

### Arweave

_**Planned:**_ In the interest of providing a decentralized option for data access all Oracle data
is additionally replicated to [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org). This provides a data access option
that does not require egress fees. Arweave implementation will be accompanied by relevant access
patterns.

## Reading Bytestream Data

In order to store the massive amount of data generated by the Oracles, the output is stored as
zipped bytestreams. In order to 'unpack' this data, you'll need the associated protobuf from
[github.com/helium/proto](https://github.com/helium/proto).

<!--TODO: list the specific protos used for each file type  -->

## Service Providers

Several Helium ecosystem companies are building interfaces around Oracle data. These services range
from APIs to Oracle data explorers
