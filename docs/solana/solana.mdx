:::warning 🚧 This document is a work in progress. 🚧

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

As of
[HIP-70, Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md)
Helium is moving to the Solana blockchain.

## Major Milestones

- Available on Solana DevNet for testing [Deployed]
- Smart Contract Audit [Ongoing]
- MainNet Launch [Soon™]

### Migration Process Steps

1. The Helium blockchain will officially halt.
2. Chain state will be snapshotted.
3. Existing $HNT and $MOBILE will be mapped to Solana. Hotspots will be minted as NFTs.
4. During the Migration, POC and Data Transfer will continue to function through the offchain
   Oracle, rewards will be claimable after the transition phase (estimated 24-48 hours) is complete.
5. Users and Exchanges can access their assets using the same private key on Solana (Solana and
   Helium blockchain use the same [ed25519 encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA)
   algorithm.)
6. Programmatic Treasury is planned to be activated in 2023 Q2, users will be able to convert
   $MOBILE and $IOT into $HNT on chain at that time.

## Migration Guides

The following are migration guides for different users of Helium:

- [Application Builder](./migration/application-builder)
- [Exchange](./migration/exchange)
- [Governance Participant](./migration/governance)
- [Hotspot Owner](./migration/hotspot-owner)
- [Ledger User](./migration/ledger)
- [LoRaWAN Network User](./migration/network-user)
- [Maker](./solana/migration/maker)

## Programs

The code for all of these programs is open source, and available in
[helium-program-library](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library)

:::info Program Audit

These contracts are being audited by [Sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/). A link to audit report will be
provided once complete.

<!--TODO: Not yet, when it's done link to audit report  -->
