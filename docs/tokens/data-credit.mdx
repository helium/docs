Data Credits (DCs) are the mechanism by which all Helium network usage is paid for. This token is
redeemable for data transfer on both the IoT and Mobile subnetworks. Furthermore, certain actions
such as onboarding a Hotspot are paid for using DC.

For further reading on DCs place in the overall mechanics of the Helium network, refer to
[burn and mint economics](/tokens/hnt-token#burn-and-mint-economics) in the HNT token documentation.

## Data Credit Fundamentals

**One Data Credit equals $0.00001 USD.**

The amount of DC produced by burning one HNT will fluctuate based on the USD price of HNT as
reported by the HNT [Price Oracles](/oracles/price-oracles). The tool below demonstrates the HNT to
DC conversion based on the Oracle price of HNT.

## Data Credit Usage

DCs are used first and foremost as the payment of data transfer on the Helium IoT and Mobile
networks. Unlike traditional wireless networks, the Helium Network has no annual fee, and users only
pay for data used. In the original design of the protocol, it was recognized that users of the
network would not be comfortable with the volatility that comes with typical token economics.
Therefore, DCs were designed such that all data transfer is pinned to USD, making it predictable.

DCs are also used for specific functions on the Helium subnetworks, such as onboarding or asserting
the locations of Hotspots. See the [IoT](#dc-and-iot) and [Mobile](#dc-and-mobile) usage sections
below for more details. DCs are not transferable once created. When being used for network transfer,
they can be delegated to be used for data transfer accounting. Once DCs have been delegated, they
cannot be redelegated.

## Acquiring Data Credits

At a network level, DCs are only generated through the conversion of HNT. However, several tools
exist to simplify the process for network users.

:::important Data Credits are non-transferable

Once the DC mint transaction is complete, the receiving Helium wallet owns all of the DC and cannot
transfer them to any other Helium wallet.

DC can be delegated to network operator wallets in arrangement with the operator. This is a one-time
action. Learn more in the [Fund an Organizationally Unique Identifier](/iot/run-an-lns/fund-an-oui)
documentation.

### HNT Swap

For individuals or organizations with HNT holdings and familiarity with using cryptocurrencies in
business operations, converting HNT to DCs via the on-chain Helium programs provides a
straightforward method for acquiring DCs.

HNT can be converted to DC using the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) or
[Helium CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet) wallet.

### Sphere Data Credit Portal

The [Data Credit Portal](/tokens/data-credit-portal) built by [Sphere](https://spherepay.co) allows
network users to acquire DCs using a credit card. The tool is designed for allocating DCs for
network users such as [LNS operators](/iot/lorawan-network-servers) or mobile
[service providers](/mobile/service-providers). The tool provides a clear invoice once transactions
are complete to simplify accounting.

## Data Credits and IoT {#dc-and-iot}

On the Helium IoT network, the primary utility of DCs is for network data transfer. Data transfer is
billed in 24-byte increments, per message. Data transfer is only billed if the message is delivered
through the Helium network.

Network users also have the choice to purchase multiple reports of the same packet. These additional
reports each account for their own cost. For instance, if three 24-byte copies are returned for a
given message, the cost would be 3 DC.

### Data Transfer Calculator

Use this calculator to estimate deployment costs based on the number of devices and how often they
send data.

This calculator assumes a 24-byte message size which is typical of most deployments.

### IoT Protocol Fees

In addition to network data transfer, DCs are also utilized for certain network-related fees.

| Action            | Fee                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Device Onboarding | $40                                     |
| Assert Location   | $10                                     |
| OUI               | $100                                    |
| DevAddr           | $100 ($800)<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup> |

[^1]: DevAddrs must be purchased in slabs of 8.

## Data Credits and Mobile {#dc-and-mobile}

In much the same design as the Helium IoT Network, the Helium Mobile Network leverages DCs as the
sole mechanism of billing and fee management. However, as a separate protocol, different pricing
mechanics apply. While the Helium IoT Network charges data at a rate of $0.00001 per 24-byte
message, the Helium Mobile Network charges data at a rate of **$0.50 per 1 gigabyte** (50,000 DC).

On cellular networks, it is customary that network operators bill for bulk data rather than for
individual packets. By setting the data cost to $0.50 per gigabyte, the Helium Mobile network
positions itself competitively in the marketplace while preserving valuable rewards for the Mobile
Hotspot operator.

### Mobile Protocol Fees

Fees related to onboarding and location assert were defined through community governance through
[HIP-89](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0089-mobile-network-onboard-fees.md).

| Action               | Fee                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CBRS Onboard         | $40                             |
| CBRS Assert Location | $10                             |
| Wifi Indoor Onboard  | $10<sup>(</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup> |
| Wifi Outdoor Onboard | $10<sup>(</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup> |

[^2]:
    [HIP-96](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0096-wifi-ap-onboarding-structure.md) set an
    additional MOBILE token onboarding fee for WiFi hotspots as well as the DC onboarding fee.
