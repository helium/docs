The Helium Network Token (HNT) is the native cryptocurrency and protocol token of the Helium
Network.

The original Helium blockchain produced the first HNT on July 29th, 2019, on block 93. There was no
pre-mine of HNT before the launch of the Network. The Helium network migrated to the Solana
Blockchain on April 18, 2023.

The mint address for HNT is [`hntyVP6YFm1Hg25TN9WGLqM12b8TQmcknKrdu1oxWux`][hnt-mint-addr] on the
Solana blockchain.

Network tokens.

## HNT Usage

HNT serves the needs of the two primary parties in the Helium Ecosystem:

1. **Hotspot Hosts and Operators**. Hosts are rewarded in network tokens like [IOT][iot] or
   [MOBILE][mobile] while deploying and maintaining network coverage. These network tokens are
   redeemable for HNT.
2. **Enterprises and Developers use the Helium Network** to connect devices and build IoT
   applications. [Data Credits][datacredit], which are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from HNT,
   [are used to pay transaction fees][txn-fees] for wireless data transmissions on the Network.

## HNT Token Economic Concepts

The Network uses three token economic concepts to ensure HNT supply is both plentiful for usage
needs and relatively scarce, with a known maximum.

### Max Supply

The Network targeted the distribution of 5,000,000 HNT per month at launch. Following the community
approval of HIP-20, the Network uses a two-year halving schedule, resulting in a maximum HNT supply
of 223,000,000 HNT.

    Year 1 starts on **August 1st, 2019**. The first halving happened on day one of year three,
    **August 1st, 2021**.

### Burn and Mint Economics {#burn-and-mint-economics}

[Data Credits][datacredit] (DC) are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from HNT and is used to pay
fees on the Helium Network. DC is only produced by burning HNT. This HNT to DC relationship is based
on a design commonly called a [burn and mint equilibrium][bme] and intends to allow for the supply
of HNT to respond to network usage trends.

### Net Emissions

Net Emissions give the protocol enough HNT for rewards in perpetuity.

Net Emissions enable the Network to monitor the number of HNT burned for DC in a given epoch and add
that to the number of HNT to mint that epoch. The current value for Net Emissions is 1,643.83561643
HNT.

For example, if less than 1,643.83561643 HNT is burned for DC within an epoch, the full amount
burned will be re-minted and distributed into the subnetworks Treasury for that epoch. However, if
more than 1,643 HNT is burned for DC within a single epoch, any HNT burn for DC over 1,643.83561643
will be permanently burned and removed from the max supply, while 1,643.83561643 being re-minted and
distributed to the Subnetworks.

The Net Emissions cap can be verified on chain
[here](https://explorer.solana.com/address/BQ3MCuTT5zVBhNfQ4SjMh3NPVhFy73MPV8rjfq5d1zie/anchor-account)

A cap on the number of HNT minted via Net Emissions per epoch ensures the desired deflationary
effect of Burn and Mint and the resulting reduction of supply. Because HNT produced via Net
Emissions do not add to the total outstanding, they do not violate max supply.
