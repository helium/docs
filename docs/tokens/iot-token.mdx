IOT is the protocol token of the [Helium IoT Network][iot-network]. IOT was introduced to the Helium
Network through the community proposal [HIP-52][hip-52] and is further defined in subsequent
HIPs<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup>. The first IOT tokens were minted following the
Solana migration on April 18, 2023.

[^1]: [HIP-70: Scaling the Helium Network][hip-70]
[^2]: [HIP-77: Solana Parameters][hip-77]

The IOT token is mined by LoRaWAN Hotspots through both data transfer proceeds as well as Proof of
Coverage.

The mint address for IOT is [`iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns`][iot-mint-address] on the
Solana blockchain.

## Redemption for HNT

Protocol tokens like IOT will always be backed by HNT and will convert to HNT. To enable this, each
network within the Helium Network is allocated a pool of HNT based on the Network Utility Score. The
redemption ratio is set algorithmically by the treasury swap contacts based on this Network Utility
Score.

The [Helium Wallet App][wallet-app] serves as the primary platform for exchanging IOT to HNT. This
transaction can also be performed directly through the Solana blockchain using the open-source
tooling found in the [Helium GitHub repositories][github].

## Token Allocation

IOT follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of 200,000,000,000 (200B).

Year 1 for IOT started on August 1st, 2022.

The issuance is scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT issuance halvings.

The emissions schedule was created in [HIP-52][hip-52-emisions] and confirmed in
[HIP-77][hip-77-emisions] and is as follows:

| Year | IOT at Year Start | IOT Minted | Proof of Coverage <sup>(</sup>[^3]<sup>)</sup> | Data Transfer <sup>(</sup>[^3]<sup>)</sup> | Oracles <sup>(</sup>[^4]<sup>)</sup> | Operations Fund | veHNT Stakes |

[^3]: Any IOT not rewarded for data transfer is rolled into Proof of Coverage.
[^4]: Oracles are not rewarded until additional Oracle operators deploy services.
