# Improving Proof-Of-Coverage

### Has your Hotspot been unable to complete challenges on the network? If there are known Hotspots in the neighborhood, they just may not be able to hear you because of interference or its position is poor.

#### There are a few ways to try and address this.

1. Moving the Hotspot to a different window, or higher floor if possible. Metal
   window screens can also affect RF, so if those can be removed it may improve
   the signal.
2. Placing the Hotspot outdoors. Some building materials in the surrounding
   walls can block RF. For example, Stucco buildings have a layer of metal wire,
   so placing at least the antenna outdoors would help with that. Look for IP-66
   Waterproof cases if you’re intending to place the Hotspot outside. You can
   purchase these from mouser.com, amazon.com, or most hardware stores.
3. Some newer high-rise buildings have a UV protective layer on the outside of
   the building glass that is known to block and interfere with radio signals.
   If this occurs, you could try moving the Hotspot outside (in a weatherproof
   case), or purchase an outdoor antenna so it can bypass the glass.
4. Check and see if you’re on a relay by searching for it here. If a Hotspot
   being relayed, it means its internet connection is being relayed through
   another Hotspot on the Network. To take the Hotspot out of relay requires
   opening ports on your internet router (to port 44158), and may require some
   additional work beyond opening ports, like setting a static IP, depending on
   your router manufacturer. This can help it better maintain sync and properly
   send/receive transaction receipts for Beacons and Witnesses.

If you find your Hotspot relayed, You may need to check with your internet
router manufacturers documentation for the specific steps, as each one has a
different process for opening the ports.
