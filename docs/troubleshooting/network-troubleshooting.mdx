# Network Troubleshooting

With the introduction of Light Hotspots, the network requirements and recommendations have changed.
Light Hotspots do not require peer-to-peer to connect to each other - they connect directly to
Validators to receive Challenges and report their witness receipts.

The Light Hotspot â†’ Validator connection is a standard gRPC connection. The default port Validators
listen on is 8080 so Hotspots should be able to connect Outbound to that port.

Note: Validator operators can choose whichever port they want. If a Hotspot can not connect to a
Validator, the Hotspot will drop that Validator and automatically try to connect to a different one.

For Original Helium Hotspots, firmware updates are pushed over port 443, so that port should always
be open Outbound. You should check with your manufacturer to see which port they use to push
firmware updates to ensure they can be received.

During the remaining transition to Light Hotspots, the Hotspots will continue to sync the blockchain
in case a rollback is needed. A Hotspot is considered "Light" after it is synced past block
1,350,664. Proof-of-Coverage participation is not dependent on being fully synced. As such, the
previous recommendation of In/Out port 44158 is still valid for the time being. Once the transition
is complete, this will no longer be necessary or have an effect.

Please also verify with your manufacturer if they require any specific ports for connecting to the
Hotspots for support. For Original Helium Hotspot support, we recommend ports 22 and 2222-2233 open
Outbound only.

(Pre-Light Hotspot recommendations)

Can't connect to the internet? Connected but can't transmit? Here are some steps that may help!

Helium Hotspots may not work if the Hotspot is behind a firewall or uses an incompatible NAT type.
Other times it may be because of a router configuration or the internet is offline. This article
aims to help resolve any issues you may have.

If none of the below fixes your Hotspot connection, please visit the Helium Community Discord,
[#hotspot-issues](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/813976183519445084).

:::

1. Check Your Cables If using Ethernet, make sure your Ethernet cable is securely plugged into the
   Hotspot and your internet provider modem. A blinking amber light next to the Ethernet port on the
   Hotspot means there is a good connection. Enthernet cables can fail from time to time, so trying
   a different cable may correct your problem.

2. Check Your Internet Connection Confirm that you are able to connect to the Internet from your
   location using your home computer, on the same network. If you cannot connect to the Internet,
   you will need to contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for additional assistance on your
   account/connection.

If using Wi-Fi, confirm that you can connect to your wireless network with your WEP or WPA security
password. If you do not know how to operate or access your wireless modem, you will need to contact
the manufacturer of the equipment directly.

If you're able to connect to the internet, power cycle your router. Unplug your Hotspot and router
from your wall or power strip for 2 minutes. Then, plug them back in to see if you are able to
connect to the Internet.

3. Internet Works and Cannot Connect to Helium Network/Hotspot is being Relayed If you are able to
   connect to the Internet, but cannot get an inbound or outbound connection to the network, it may
   be a firewall issue or your Hotspot is being Relayed.

Hotspots being Relayed are not directly connected to the internet, but through another Hotspot on
the network and can adversely affect mining and earnings. Relayed Hotspots can be identified in
Explorer.

We recommend enabling TCP Ports 44158 in both directions in your router. Check your Router's
manufacturing instructions on how to open ports 44158.

For support and firmware updates, we will need ports 22 and 443 open Outbound.

4. Router NAT Type Incompatible

This information can be used to judge the ease or difficulty of connecting to the network and is
available by going to your router.

- Type 1 / Open: The system is connected directly to the Internet and will provide the best
  connection quality.
- Type 2 / Moderate: The system is connected to the Internet with a router, and can only connect
  with other using Type 1 / Open or Type 2 / Moderate.
- Type 3 / Strict: The system is connected to the Internet with a router and can only connect to
  those who use Type 1 / Open, meaning some or all connections may be being blocked.

Check your modem settings and documentation for more information on how to configure NAT Type.
