# Network Troubleshooting

Can't connect to the internet? Connected but can't transmit? Here are some steps
that may help!

Helium Hotspots may not work if the Hotspot is behind a firewall or uses an
incompatible NAT type. Other times it may be because of a router configuration
or the internet is offline. This article aims to help resolve any issues you may
have.

If none of the below fixes your Hotspot connection, please visit the Helium
Community Discord, #hotspot-setup-help.

1. Check Your Cables If using Ethernet, make sure your Ethernet cable is
   securely plugged into the Hotspot and your internet provider modem. A
   blinking amber light next to the Ethernet port on the Hotspot means there is
   a good connection. Cables can also fail from time to time, so trying a
   different cable can help may also help.

2. Check Your Internet Connection Confirm that you are able to connect to the
   Internet from your location using your home computer, on the same network. If
   you cannot connect to the Internet, you will need to contact your Internet
   Service Provider (ISP) for additional assistance on your account/connection.

If using Wi-Fi, confirm that you can connect to your wireless network with your
WEP or WPA security password. If you do not know how to operate or access your
wireless modem, you will need to contact the manufacturer of the equipment
directly.

If you're able to connect to the internet, power cycle your router. Unplug your
Hotspot and router from your wall or power strip for 2 minutes. Then, plug them
back in to see if you are able to connect to the Internet.

3. Internet Works and Cannot Connect to Helium Network/Hotspot is being Relayed
   If you are able to connect to the Internet, but cannot get an inbound or
   outbound connection to the network, it may be a firewall issue or your
   Hotspot is being Relayed.

Hotspots being Relayed are not directly connected to the internet, but through
another Hotspot on the network and can adversely affect mining and earnings.
Relayed Hotspots can be identified in Explorer.

We recommend enabling TCP Ports 44158 in both directions in your modem. Check
your Router's manufacturing instructions on how to open ports 44158.

To get started with port forwarding, check out https://portforward.com

For support and firmware updates, we will need ports 22 and 443 open Outbound.

4. Router NAT Type Incompatible

This information can be used to judge the ease or difficulty of connecting to
the network and is available by going to your router.

- Type 1 / Open: The system is connected directly to the Internet and will
  provide the best connection quality.
- Type 2 / Moderate: The system is connected to the Internet with a router, and
  can only connect with other using Type 1 / Open or Type 2 / Moderate.
- Type 3 / Strict: The system is connected to the Internet with a router and can
  only connect to those who use Type 1 / Open, meaning some or all connections
  may be being blocked.

Check your modem settings and documentation for more information on how to
configure NAT Type.
