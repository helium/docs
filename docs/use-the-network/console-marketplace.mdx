# Console Marketplace

The Console Marketplace provides a way for Helium community members to contribute and share Console
components. Initially, this includes Integrations, but over time the marketplace will expand to
Decoders, and others.

Console Hosting Providers can choose which components are available to end-users. Some (for example,
Helium Foundation) may choose to enable all available Console components, while others may only want
to provide their users access to fewer for simplicity.

For more information about Integrations go [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).

## How it works overview

Marketplace participants:

- Community members: contribute Console components.
- Helium Foundation technical team: reviews and approves components.
- Console Hosting Providers: choose which approved components are available to Console users on
  Console UI.
- Console users: decide which Console components to use.

Follow the instructions to submit a Marketplace Integration or Decoder pull request to the Helium
Console github [repository](https://github.com/helium/console) for consideration by the Helium
Foundation.

## Create a Marketplace Integration

- Add image assets for icons. Icons should be square and in png or svg format. Place image assets in
  `/assets/img/channels` folder and follow naming conventions.

- Add new integration type to `/lib/console/channels/channel.ex` and indicate if new integration is
  in `@http_types` and `@long_type_names`.

- Import image assets and add new integration info to `integrationImgMap`, add an entry to
  `COMMUNITY_INTEGRATION_TYPES`, and indicate if new integration is `http_integrations` or
  `mqtt_integrations`. All in `/assets/js/util/integrationInfo.js`.

- Create form component for new integration page in `/assets/js/components/channels/community`
  folder and follow naming conventions.

- Import form to `/assets/js/components/channels/ChannelNew.jsx` and add imported form component to
  `renderForm()`.

- Create form component for update integration page `/assets/js/components/channels/community`
  folder and follow naming conventions.

- Import form to `/assets/js/components/channels/ChannelConnectionDetails.jsx` and add imported form
  to the switch case in `export default () =>`.

- Add credential transform methods to populate actual connection details in file
  `/lib/console/community/community_channels.ex` in `append_connection_details()` and
  `inject_credentials()`.

- Add new integration controller action to `/lib/console_web/controllers/v1/channel_controller.ex`
  under `create_community_channel()` or create a new function if needed.

More info about Integrations [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).

## Create a Marketplace Decoder Function (staging)

- Decide on your format name. Make sure it is written in lower case (ex. `super_decoder`).

- Add image assets for icons. Icons should be square and in png or svg format. Place image assets in
  `/assets/img/functions/community` folder and follow naming conventions.

- Add new function format (ex. `super_decoder`) to `@all_formats` in
  `/lib/console/functions/function.ex`

- Import image assets and add new function entry to `COMMUNITY_FUNCTION_FORMATS` in
  `/assets/js/util/functionInfo.js`. Make sure the format value of the entry matches (ex.
  `super_decoder`).

- Create a new file in `/community_functions` with your function body written in javascript.

- Create an `@variable` for your function body and add a case for your function in the
  `inject_body()` method in `/lib/console/community/community_functions.ex`

## Enable Marketplace Integrations or Decoder Functions (For Console Hosting Providers)

Console Hosting Providers can choose which Integrations or Decoder Functions are available for their
users. More information about becoming a Console Hosting Provider
[here](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server).

:::warning

An Integration must be available for devices to transfer data through it and a Decoder must be
available to decode packets. For example, if an existing Integration is disabled, any devices will
no longer be able to transfer data via that Integration.

### Choosing Approved Integrations

Choose which Integrations are available for users by making the following configuration settings.

Set `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS` .env variable to toggle desired integrations.

- To choose all reviewed integrations (default): `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=all`.

- To choose selected integrations: `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=<integrations>`. For example, to choose the
  following integrations: HTTP, MQTT, CARGO: `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=http,mqtt,cargo`

Integration keys can be found in `/lib/console/channels/channel.ex` listed in `@long_type_names`.

### Choosing Approved Decoder Functions (staging)

Choose which Decoder Functions are available for users by making the following configuration
settings.

Set `ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS` .env variable to toggle desired functions.

- To choose all reviewed decoder functions (default): `ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS=all`.

- To choose selected decoder functions: `ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS=<functions>`. For example, to choose the
  following functions: CUSTOM, CAYENNE: `ALLOWED_FUNCTIONS=custom,cayenne`

Function keys can be found in `/lib/console/functions/function.ex` listed in `@all_formats`
