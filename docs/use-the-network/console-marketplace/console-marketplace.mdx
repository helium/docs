# Console Marketplace

The Console Marketplace provides a way for Helium community members to contribute and share Console components. Initially, this includes Integrations, but over time the marketplace will expand to Decoders, and others.

Console Hosting Providers can choose which components are available to end-users. Some (for example, Helium Foundation) may choose to expose all available Console components, while others may only want to provide their users access to fewer for simplicity.

## How it works overview

Marketplace participants:

- Community members: contribute Console components.
- Helium Foundation technical team: reviews and approves components.
- Console Hosting Providers: choose which approved components are available to Console users on Console UI.
- Console users: decide which Console components to use. 

## Create a Marketplace Integration 

Follow the instructions to submit a Marketplace Integration pull request to the Helium Console github [repository](https://github.com/helium/console) for consideration by the Helium Foundation:

- Add image assets for icons. Icons should be square and in png or svg format. Place image assets in ```/assets/img/channels``` folder and follow naming conventions.

- Add new integration type to ```/lib/console/channels/channel.ex``` and indicate if new integration is in ```@http_types``` and ```@long_type_names```.

- Import image assets and add new integration info to ```integrationImgMap```, add an entry to ```COMMUNITY_INTEGRATION_TYPES```, and indicate if new integration is ```http_integrations``` or ```mqtt_integrations```. All in ```/assets/js/util/integrationInfo.js```.

- Create form component for new integration page in ```/assets/js/components/channels/community``` folder and follow naming conventions.

- Import form to ```/assets/js/components/channels/ChannelNew.jsx``` and add imported form to ```renderForm()```. 

- Create form component for update integration page ```/assets/js/components/channels/community``` folder and follow naming conventions.

- Import form to ```/assets/js/components/channels/ChannelConnectionDetails.jsx``` and add imported form to ```export default () =>```. 

- Add credential transform methods to populate actual connection details in file ```/lib/console/community/community_channels.ex``` in ```append_connection_details()``` and ```inject_credentials()```.

- Add new integration controller action to ```/lib/console_web/controllers/v1/channel_controller.ex``` under ```create_community_channel()``` or create a new function if needed.

## Enable Marketplace Integrations (For Console Hosting Providers)

:::warning

An Integration must be enabled for devices to transfer data throught it. For example, if an existing Integration is disabled, any devices will no longer be able to transfer data via that Integration.

:::

Console Hosting Providers can choose which Integrations are enabled for users by making the following configuration settings. 

More information about becoming a Console Hosting Provider [here](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server). 

Set ```ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS.env``` variable to toggle desired integrations.

- To enable all reviewed integrations (default): ```ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=all```.

- To enable selected integrations: ```ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=<integrations>```. For example, to enable the following integrations: HTTP, MQTT, CARGO: ```ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=http,mqtt,cargo```

Integration keys can be found in ```/templates/allowed-integrations.json```.
