# Console Marketplace

The Console Marketplace provides a way for Helium community members to contribute and share Console
components. Initially, this includes Integrations, but over time the marketplace will expand to
Decoders, and others.

Console Hosting Providers can choose which components are available to end-users. Some (for example,
Helium Foundation) may choose to enable all available Console components, while others may only want
to provide their users access to fewer for simplicity.

For more information about Integrations go [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).

## How it works overview

Marketplace participants:

- Community members: contribute Console components.
- Helium Foundation technical team: reviews and approves components.
- Console Hosting Providers: choose which approved components are available to Console users on
  Console UI.
- Console users: decide which Console components to use.

## Create a Marketplace Integration

Follow the instructions to submit a Marketplace Integration pull request to the Helium Console
github [repository](https://github.com/helium/console) for consideration by the Helium Foundation:

- Add image assets for icons. Icons should be square and in png or svg format. Place image assets in
  `/assets/img/channels` folder and follow naming conventions.

- Add new integration type to `/lib/console/channels/channel.ex` and indicate if new integration is
  in `@http_types` and `@long_type_names`.

- Import image assets and add new integration info to `integrationImgMap`, add an entry to
  `COMMUNITY_INTEGRATION_TYPES`, and indicate if new integration is `http_integrations` or
  `mqtt_integrations`. All in `/assets/js/util/integrationInfo.js`.

- Create form component for new integration page in `/assets/js/components/channels/community`
  folder and follow naming conventions.

- Import form to `/assets/js/components/channels/ChannelNew.jsx` and add imported form component to
  `renderForm()`.

- Create form component for update integration page `/assets/js/components/channels/community`
  folder and follow naming conventions.

- Import form to `/assets/js/components/channels/ChannelConnectionDetails.jsx` and add imported form
  to the switch case in `export default () =>`.

- Add credential transform methods to populate actual connection details in file
  `/lib/console/community/community_channels.ex` in `append_connection_details()` and
  `inject_credentials()`.

- Add new integration controller action to `/lib/console_web/controllers/v1/channel_controller.ex`
  under `create_community_channel()` or create a new function if needed.

## Enable Marketplace Integrations (For Console Hosting Providers)

:::warning

An Integration must be enabled for devices to transfer data through it. For example, if an existing
Integration is disabled, any devices will no longer be able to transfer data via that Integration.

:::

Console Hosting Providers can choose which Integrations are enabled for users by making the
following configuration settings.

More information about becoming a Console Hosting Provider
[here](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server).

Set `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS` .env variable to toggle desired integrations.

- To enable all reviewed integrations (default): `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=all`.

- To enable selected integrations: `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=<integrations>`. For example, to enable the
  following integrations: HTTP, MQTT, CARGO: `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS=http,mqtt,cargo`

Integration keys can be found in `/lib/console/channels/channel.ex`.
