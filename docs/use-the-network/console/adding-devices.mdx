### When Adding Devices for the First Time

As network usage increases, a mechanism called the XOR filter allows the Console backend (router) to only process known traffic and avoid spending resources on unfamiliar packets, which significantly improves performance.

However, the first time a device joins the network its keys need to be added to the blockchain and the updated block propagated to the miners (Hotspots).

This initial join process could take up to 20 mins depending on:

- when this transaction (batched with others) gets added to the blockchain
- the overall performance of the blockchain

After the initial join takes place future rejoining of the same device will be much quicker. 

More information about XOR filters [here](https://engineering.helium.com/2021/07/29/console-updates-2.0.html).

To add a device, go to **Devices** and click the **+ Add Device** icon. The Add New Device screen appears.

Enter a name for your device. Device names do not have to be unique \(as every
device will be given a unique identifier generated by Console\). 

`DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey` are auto generated by the Helium Console when you create
a new device. 

However, you can input your own `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey`
if your device is already provisioned with these credentials.

- **Device EUI** - 64-bit end-device identifier, sometimes called Manufacturer
  EUI
- **App EUI** - 64-bit application identifier
- **App Key** - 128-bit AES key, used to secure communication between device and
  network

Once added, you'll see a consolidated view of all your device details, as well
as the Activation Method \(only `OTAA` is currently supported\).

## Importing Devices
Console provides a simple way to batch add multiple devices using a CSV file. 

To add a device, go to Devices and click the + Add Device icon.

Under Import Devices choose a .csv file that contains the information for the imported devices. The .csv file needs to include the following fields as required columns: `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, `AppKey`, and `Name`. Optionally you can include a `LabelID` column to add labels to imported devices.

## Important Information When Adding Devices


### Potential Delays Related to Sub-band

LoRaWAN devices may behave differently from one manufacturer to another. If your device does not try all 8 sub-bands, then you will need to ensure it is trying to communicate on the correct sub-band, which is sub-band 2.

### MSB vs LSB; and using the Correct Endianness

When copying EUIs and Keys into your device software, or into Console, make sure
you are using the correct byte ordering, known as "endianness". This is often
labeled as `MSB` \(Most Significant Bit\) and `LSB` \(Least Significant Bit\).
Reversing byte order is a very common mistake when adding a new device to the
network. On the device details page in Console, you can easily switch the byte
order of the EUIs and Key by cliking the `lsb` or `msb` label next to them.

### Is The Helium Network a Public or Private LoRaWAN?

The Helium Network is a Public LoRaWAN Network. You can read more about the
unique, blockchain-driven architecture [here](/blockchain).
