# Device Configurations

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

There's a number of device configurations available including: 

- [ADR](adr#adr)
- [CF List](adr#cf-list) 
- [Alerts](adr#alerts) 
- [Multiple Packets](adr#multiple-packets)

If there's a conflict between configuration settings set for devices and labels, the device setting takes priority. 

ADR and CF List settings are either enabled/disabled and applied to device or label nodes directly using the Inspector. 

Alerts and Multiple Packets features provide various options which users need to initially configure and then apply to device or label nodes using the Inspector. 


## ADR

Adaptive Data Rate or ADR is a mechanism for adapting the data rate of devices
in a LoRaWAN network. This allows a device's airtime and power consumption to be
optimized by the Network Server. Learn more about ADR from Semtech's developer
portal
[here](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/library/tech-papers-and-guides/understanding-adr/).

:::warning

- ADR will only work if your device requests ADR.
- Using ADR is only suggested for devices that are static for long periods of
  times. ADR is not suggested for devices that are constantly changing location
  or have unstable RF conditions.

### ADR Algorithm

The network server behind Console implements a specific algorithm for
determining the optimal data rate and transmit power to send down to the device.
ADR not only increases the device's data rate, but it increases or decreases
transmit power as needed. The network only calculates data-rate/power
corrections after it collects 20 contiguous uplink packets with the ADR bit set
to `1`. From this point on, the network may send downlink LinkADRReq MAC
commands, either alone or with already-scheduled downlink packets. The network
server clears its ADR history whenever a device sends an uplink packet with ADR
set to `0`.

### Configuring ADR

To configure ADR, navigate to the Flows Inspector. 

Choose the device or group of devices (label) to configure ADR.

On the Inspector click ADR.

  )}

For quick identification, an ADR symbol appears on the node.

## CF List

The Join-Accept CF List configures channels according to the LoRaWAN spec to use sub-band 2. Devices that have not correctly implemented the LoRaWAN spec may experience transfer issues when this setting is enabled.
- Enabled, the server will send a CF List with every other join.
- Disabled, the server will not send a CF List. The channel mask is still transmitted via ADR command.

By default this setting is disabled.

**Note:** This setting is only applicable to US915 devices.  

### Configuring CF List

To configure CF List, navigate to the Flows Inspector. 

Choose the device or group of devices (label) to configure CF List.

On the Inspector click CF List.

For quick identification, a symbol appears on the node.


## Alerts

Alerts (email and webhooks) are avaialble for a number of conditions related to devices and integrations including when devices are deleted, Integrations updated or deleted.

Helium Console will deliver email-based notifications for various events that happen for devices. For each notification, either `Administrators`, `Managers`, or both can be notified via email. The current
list of supported notifications are:

To access this setting, choose Label from the side menu > Label Settings > Notifications > Webhooks. 
To obtain a webhook key for authorization, choose Organizations from the side menu and copy relevant webhook key.

### Configuring Alerts


## Multiple Packets

The ability to pay for additional packets for redundancy and location triangulation purposes. 

**Note:** Even if you donâ€™t use the multiple packet purchase feature, there are certain conditions which the system will purchase multiple packets to help ensure successful packet transmission. These include: initial joining of the device (up to 5 packets), downlink (up to 3 packets), and for acknowledgements (up to 3 packets).
