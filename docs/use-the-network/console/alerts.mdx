# Alerts

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Alerts (email or webhooks) can be configured for a number of conditions related to devices and integrations including when devices are deleted, or when integrations are updated or deleted.

User types (e.g., Administrator or Managers) can be specified to receive alerts.

### Configuring Alerts

To configure alerts from the Flows workspace, select a Device/Label node or Integration node depending on the type of alert to configure and select the Inspector tab. 

Select an existing alert or create a new one.

To create a new one, select Create New Alert choose a name, alert type (email, webhook), and the alert.
