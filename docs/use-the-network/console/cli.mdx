# Console CLI

## Introduction

The Command Line Interface \(CLI\) allows you to interact with the Console API
without making HTTP Requests, but instead via a command line prompt. It's ideal
for mass provisioning or for integrating onto a production line.

In addition, it has certain high-level features for account setup like importing
devices from other network providers.

## Installation

Download a compiled release
[here](https://github.com/helium/helium-console-cli/releases) for your
appropriate platform.

## API Key

You must activate [an API key](api#api-key) before using the CLI.

The first time you run the CLI, it will prompt you for this key. It will save
the key in a local file: `.helium-console-config.toml`

## Usage

### Features

You can view the most current commands, features, and documentation by accessing
the help menus. For example: `helium-console-cli --help` or
`helium-console-cli device --help`.

Current high level features are:

- create and delete devices records, using \(app_eui, app_key, dev_eui\) or UUID
- list all device records
- create and delete labels by UUID
- create and delete device labels, by using \(device_uuid, label_uuid\)
- import devices from The Things Network \(TTN\

  )

### Examples

Let's create a device:

```text
helium-console-cli device create 000A000100000046 CB67C92DD5898D07872224202DED7E76 DEADBEEF23F23454 foo
```

You'll get a response with the full record of this new device:

```text
Device {
    app_eui: "000A000100000046",
    app_key: "CB67C92DD5898D07872224202DED7E76",
    dev_eui: "DEADBEEF23F23454",
    id: "03f5967a-7c79-42a2-bd5f-6e51015e73e3",
    name: "foo",
    organization_id: "07273bc4-4bc9-44ec-b4d5-ad320f162e15",
    oui: 1,
}
```

You can view this device again by either \(app_eui, app_key, dev_eui\) or by
id/uuid. For example:

```text
helium-console-cli device get 000A000100000046 CB67C92DD5898D07872224202DED7E76 DEADBEEF23F23454
```

or

```text
helium-console-cli device get-by-id 03f5967a-7c79-42a2-bd5f-6e51015e73e3
```

These commands will return the same record as above.

Similarly, you may delete the device:

```text
helium-console-cli device delete 000A000100000046 CB67C92DD5898D07872224202DED7E76 DEADBEEF23F23454
```

or

```text
helium-console-cli device delete-by-id 03f5967a-7c79-42a2-bd5f-6e51015e73e3
```

Finally, at any time, you may list all your devices:

```text
helium-console-cli device list
```

Which will return an array of all your devices:

```text
[
    Device {
        app_eui: "000A000100000046",
        app_key: "CB67C92DD5898D07872224202DED7E76",
        dev_eui: "DEADBEEF23F23454",
        id: "03f5967a-7c79-42a2-bd5f-6e51015e73e3",
        name: "foo",
        organization_id: "07273bc4-4bc9-44ec-b4d5-ad320f162e15",
        oui: 1,
    }
]
```

### TTN Import

To start an import session, use the ttn import command:

```text
helium-console-cli ttn import
```

You will be prompted for a ttnctl access code, which you can generate by
clicking on `ttnctl access code` [here](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/).
This single-use access code is valid for 5 minutes. During this time the CLI may
use the code to request an OAuth2 token; it expires after 60 minutes.

The CLI's prompts will help you:

- select to import from a single application or all applications \(maximum 10,
  otherwise the OAuth2 token is "used up"\)
- you may import all the devices at once or you may approve device import one by
  one.
- you may use the TTN App ID as an automatic label for every device or you may
  approve device labelling one by one

The import process tolerates attempts to re-import or re-label the same device.
As such, you may re-run the script to label devices with the TTN App ID even if
you already imported the devices during a previous session.
