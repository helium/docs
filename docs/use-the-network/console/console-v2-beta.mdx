# Console 2.0 Beta FAQ

**Important** on staging the first-time a device joins could take up to 10 to 20 mins. This is because the device information is being added to the blockchain and needs to be propagated to miners.

### What’s changed in Console 2.0?

The biggest new feature of Console 2.0 is Flows. 
Flows is a visual-centric view of the key elements in Console and allows users to instantly understand the relationship among devices, functions, and integration. 

### What’s the same in Console 2.0?

The interface and work flows for the following have remained largely unchanged:
- Data Credit 
- Organizations
- Users

### How do to participate and provide feedback?

Sign up for an staging account [here](https://staging-console.helium.wtf/).

Provide feedback [here](https://github.com/helium/console/issues) and use label (staging).

### Why did you make these changes to Console 2.0?

Based on learnings from your feedback, the team wanted to deliver a much more streamlined and intuitive experience to accomplish core user goals including adding devices, defining functions, and setting up integrations to transfer data to endpoints.

### Do labels still exist? Do I still need labels? What capabilities do labels have?

Yes Labels will still exist to organize and manage devices. Users can choose to apply a single or multiple Labels  to as many devices as needed, for example, to identify a sensor type like a temp sensor or location of the sensor. Anytime Labels are updated the changes flow to all devices with the Labels.

### What happens to functionality that used to be tied to labels (ADR, Notifications, multiple packet purchases)?

This functionality still exists. These settings are defined as general settings and can be applied to devices or groups of devices in the Flows workspace. Documentation will be coming.

### When will Console 2.0 get released?

It depends on the feedback and issues reported during the Console 2.0 beta phase, but our goal is to release Console 2.0 in approximately 4 - 6 weeks. 

### What will happen to devices and settings when you migrate Console 2.0 to the production server?

Nothing. Your devices and configurations will be preserved and you won’t need to take any action. 

### What happens to my Data Credit balance?
This migration has no impact on Data Credit balances.
