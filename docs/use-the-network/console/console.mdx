# Helium Console

The [Helium Console](http://console.helium.com/) is a web-based device
management tool that allows developers to register, authenticate, and manage
their devices on the Helium network. In addition to device management, Console
provides prebuilt connections called Integrations to route device data via HTTPs
or MQTT; or directly to cloud services like AWS IoT.

Device Management includes:

- Organization structure with labels, and user-level permissions
- Device ID registration and seamless, secure onboarding and authentication
- Data Credits for utilizing the Helium Network

Console is available as a free to use hosted application at
[console.helium.com](https://console.helium.com).
