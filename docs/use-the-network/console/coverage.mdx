# Coverage

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

Coverage provides visibility for Hotspots that transfer device packets as well as the status of
those Hotspots within Console.

## Identify Hotspots that hear devices

Coverage makes it easy to identify which Hotspots have transferred an organization’s device packets.
The `Coverage Breakdown` list is automatically populated with Hotspots that have sent traffic in the
last 24 hrs for devices belonging to the Organization.

:::info

Only Hotspots that have successfully transferred packets are displayed on the Coverage Breakdown
tab. To show all Hotspots on this tab within range of the device, turn on Multiple Packets
[here](/use-the-network/console/adr#multiple-packets) and choose to purchase all packets. Assuming
there’s sufficient Data Credit balance, Console will purchase packets from all the Hotspots that
heard the device and display them.

:::

`My Hotspots` is a simple way to filter and view only Hotspots users want to see. Select the flag
icon next to a Hotspot name for it to appear in the My Hotspots list.

If a Hotspot has not transferred data but is still of interest, simply navigate to `Hotspot Search`
run a search for it, and it will appear in the My Hotspots list. Users can also use a wallet address
and all Hotspots associated with that wallet address will appear.

## Monitoring Hotspots stats and status

Coverage displays a number of Hotspots details including Hotspot location, packets transferred, and
number of devices that it’s “seen”.

Simply click a Hotspot name to view more detailed Hotspot stats. Depending on the tab, users can
display overall stats (`Statistics` tab) or a list of the devices heard from the last 24 hours with
the `My Devices Heard` tab.

Clicking any device name takes users to the specific device page for more details.

## Creating Hotspot Aliases

Coverage allows users to easily create an alias for easier identification of the Hotspot. Click a
Hotspot name, then under its animal name, click `No Alias` to define an Alias.
