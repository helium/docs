# Data Credits

Data Credits (DCs) are central to the Helium Blockchain and LongFi. Read about
how they fit into our Tokenomics
[here](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/helium-token#data-credits-and-burn-and-mint-economics).

Not only are DCs critical for asserting new Hotspots and their location on the
blockchain, registering OUIs and devices, but they are also used to pay for
every single uplink LongFi packet that is sent on the Helium network including
inital Joins. Downlinks, and ACKS do not require Data Credits.

Every 24 bytes sent in an uplink or downlink packet cost 1 DC = $.00001.

Unlike traditional wireless networks, the Helium Network has no annual fee and
you only pay for data you use. This transaction occurs between the Miner (which
runs on every Helium Hotspot) and the LongFi Network Server, identified by the
OUI, of the device owner.

The transaction is as follows:

- A Miner receives a packet and determines who it belongs to
- The Miner dials the appropriate LongFi Network Server and offers the packet
- The LongFi Network Server expresses interest in the packet and accepts
  delivery
- The Miner provides the packet under the promise that the LongFi Network Server
  will “burn a DC” in the name of the Miner

You may have noticed that the final step includes a promise from the LongFi
Network Server. The principle at work here is that each packet in its own is
quite insignificant in value and so the Miner is willing to extend this service
of delivery in exchange for the promise; by doing such, usage experience low
latencies. Should the LongFi Network Server fail to fulfill its promise, the
Miner would place the LongFi Network Server on a deny list and would no longer
route packets from any devices from this LongFi Network Server.
