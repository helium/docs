import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Frequent actions performed from the Flows workspace include the following:

- creating node elements
- adding nodes to the workspace
- accessing debug mode
- viewing the inspector

### Creating Node Elements 

To use Flows the node elements (devices, labels, integrations, and functions) must already have been created. 

To create any node element from the Flows workspace, click the **+** circle and choose the desired node element.

### Adding Nodes to the Workspace
Important the core node elements must have been previously created before you can add them to the workspace (for info on creating node elements go here).

To add nodes to the workspace, go to the Nodes list, click **+**.
