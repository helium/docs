# Frequently Asked Questions

### What’s changed in Helium Console?

The biggest new feature of Console is Flows. Flows is a visual-centric view of the key elements in
Console and allows users to instantly understand the relationship among devices, functions, and
integrations. Flows enables users to visually connect nodes and control the flow of data.

### What’s the same in Helium Console?

The interface and work flows for the following have remained largely unchanged:

- Data Credits
- Organizations
- Users

### Why did you make these updates to Console?

Based on learnings from your feedback, the team wanted to deliver a much more streamlined and
intuitive experience to accomplish core user goals including adding devices, defining functions, and
setting up integrations to transfer data to endpoints.

### Do labels still exist? Do I still need labels? What capabilities do labels have?

Yes. Labels will still exist to organize and manage devices. Users can choose to apply a single or
multiple Labels to as many devices as needed; for example, to identify a sensor type like a "temp
sensor" or location of the sensor. Anytime Labels are updated the changes flow to all devices with
the Labels.

### What happens to functionality that used to be tied to labels (ADR, Notifications, multiple packet purchases)?

This functionality still exists. ADR and CF List can be directly applied to a device or group of
devices. With notification and packet purchase users can define these features with general settings
and apply to devices or groups of devices in the Flows workspace.

### What will happen to devices and settings when you migrate Console to the production server?

Nothing. Your devices and configurations will be preserved and you won’t need to take any action.

### What happens to my Data Credit balance?

This migration has no impact on Data Credit balances.
