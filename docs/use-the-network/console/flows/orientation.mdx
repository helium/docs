# Flows Orientation

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

The main elements of Flows are:

- The Workspace
- Nodes and Edges
- Inspector
- Debug


## Workspace
The Workspace is where you access and manipulate nodes, make connections among nodes, and make node configuration settings using the Inspector. 

The Workspace is optimized for manipulation of visual elements, and there’s a subset of configuration changes that can be made via the Inspector. 

Whenever you change elements on the workspace, save your changes so it’s the same when you come back to it after navigating to other parts of Console.

## Nodes and Edges
Nodes are graphical representations of Console elements and for quick identification are color coded:

- Devices (gray) and labels (blue) [LINK]
- Functions (purple): users can transform and/or parse payloads before sending to an endpoint [LINK]
- Integrations (green): enable devices to customer endpoints over HTTP or MQTT [LINK]

[GRAPHICS]

Edges represent the flow of data among nodes from left to right. Edges use connection points on nodes to create relationships among nodes.

[GRAPHICS]

Since devices are the source of data and integrations can only receive data there’s only one connection point for edges. 

[GRAPHICS]

Functions can both receive data from devices and continue sending data after taking action to integrations. 

[GRAPHICS]

## Data Flow

Users can control the flow of device data using edges to provide the following connections from devices/groups of devices to functions (via labels):
- to integrations
- to functions
- to function and on to integrations

[GRAPHICS]

## Inspector 
The Inspector provides the ability to:
Visually inspect node details
Make common node configuration changes
Access node in other areas of Console for more complete edits

To access the Inspector simply click a node and different options appear:

- Devices or Labels
- Functions
- Integrations
