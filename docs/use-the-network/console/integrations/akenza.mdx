# Akenza

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

[Akenza](https://www.akenza.io/) is an IoT application enablement platform, allowing you to build
great IoT products and services with value. It connects, controls, and manages IoT devices; all in
one place. You can sign up for a free account at
[https://auth.akenza.io/register](https://auth.akenza.io/register).

## Create Integration in Console

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **Akenza** integration as shown below.

    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-select-integration.png',
  )}
/>

Next you will need to navgigate to your Akenza portal in another browser window in order to obtain
the Akenza uplink secret.

In the Akenza user portal, navigate to the **Data Flows** section as shown below and click Create
Data Flow in the top right.

  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-create-data-flow.png',
  )}
/>

Next, select **HTTP** for connectivity.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-http-connectivity.png',
  )}
/>

Next, name the device connector and select Helium for the decoding type. Lastly, save the connector.

  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-helium-connector.png',
  )}
/>

Next, for simplicity we will pick the **Passthrough** device type and the E-Mail connector to
complete the data flow. Finally, click **Save Data Flow**. This Data Flow will send an email every
time the device transmits an uplink.

  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-save-data-flow.png',
  )}
/>

To complete the integration creation on Console, copy the **Uplink Secret** as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-copy-secret-key.png',
  )}
/>

Next, navigate back to your Console browser window, paste it in the **Uplink Secret** field for
step 2. Lastly, name the integration and click **Add Integration**

  src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-uplink-secret.png')}
/>

## Create Device in Akenza

Before we connect the Akenza integration to our device in Console, we first need to make Akenza
aware of it.

To do this, navigate back to your Akenza user portal window and create a new device by going to the
**Asset Inventory** section and clicking **Create Device** in the top right as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-create-device.png')}
/>

Next fill in details such as the name and description. At the very bottom, we can establish the
connection between this new device and the Data Flow we created above with the new device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-create-device-details.png',
  )}
/>

After filling in those details click Next. The final step to creating the new device is to enter the
Device EUI of the device from Console. **Important**, this is not the ID on the Console device page,
but the Device EUI as shown below. Copy the Device EUI on the Console device page as shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-dev-eui.png')} />

Paste it in the Device ID field on Akenza, then finish by clicking **Create Device**.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-paste-device-eui.png',
  )}
/>

This completes the steps required for setup on Akenza, but now we must connect our device to the
Akenza Integration on Console, follow the steps below.

## Connect Akenza Integration to Device

The final step to completing the Akenza integration with a device is to create a flow connection.
Navigate to the Flows page on Console, add the device and integration nodes, and finally connect
both of them as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-akenza-flow-connection.png',
  )}
/>

Your device data should now be flowing to Akenza once your device transmits an uplink.
