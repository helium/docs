# AWS IoT Core

[AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/) is a powerful offering that
lets developers build device-based applications and services on the AWS Cloud.
And this Integration via Helium Console automates the complexity of securely
connecting your devices to AWS IoT Core.

### Add an AWS IoT Core Integration

To add an **AWS IoT Core Integration**, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand
menu. Select the integration to add - in this case, the **AWS IoT Core**
integration:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-aws-iot-core.png"
  )}
/>

The next step is to create a new user with limited permissions that this
Integration will use.

Open up the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

Under the Services menu in the upper-left, go to **Security, Identity, &
Compliance**-&gt;**IAM**:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-iam.png"
  )}
/>

We are now going to create a new **User:**

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user.png"
  )}
/>

Set the user name to "**HeliumIntegrationAccess**" and select only
"**Programmatic access**"

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user-details.png"
  )}
/>

We now attach a policy to the newly created user that defines what permissions
they hold.

Select "**Attach existing policies directly**" and type "**AWSIoTConfigAccess"**
into the "**Filter Policies**" box and check the box to the left of the row:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user-attach-policy.png"
  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-new-user-success.png"
  )}
/>

:::warning 
Ensure you record and store these keys securely, as you will not have
an opportunity to get access to them again! 
:::

Back in the **Helium Console**, enter the credentials we just created under
**AWS Connection Details,** as well as the AWS region that you would like AWS
IoT to run in.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-enter-details.png"
  )}
/>

The **Topic** field is the AWS IoT MQTT topic that this integration will publish
uplink messages to, from devices.

Finally, we give our new Integration a name:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-name.png"
  )}
/>

And click **Create Integration**. Your new Integration is now ready for use.

### Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. You can read more about how to do
that [here](/use-the-network/console/labels).

## AWS IoT MQTT Topic composition:

### Device Uplink \(Receive Data from Device\)

This topic is defined in the **Topic** field when creating the AWS IoT
intgeration.

**Subscribe to:** `{custom_topic}`

### Device Downlink \(Send Data to Device\)

**Publish to:** `helium/devices/{Device ID}/down`

Example: `helium/devices/4f10d99a-e22e-4007-a3f0-6af3bc63acfe/down`

## AWS IoT MQTT Messages

To send data to a device, use JSON with a `payload_raw` field with a base64
encoded string.  
**Sending Data to Device \(Downlink\):**

```javascript
{
   "payload_raw": "encoded_string"
}
```

When receiving data from a device, the messages will be in JSON and look like
the following. The data from the device is in the `payload` field, and is a
base64 encoded string.  
**Receiving data from Device \(Uplink\):**

```javascript
{
  "app_eui": "06B02F1A0E482128",
  "dev_eui": "5F67F99E10B47006",
  "devaddr": "1A2FB006",
  "fcnt": 10,
  "hotspots": [
    {
      "frequency": 911.9000244140625,
      "id": "112ErPy4pa8bRBQj9XgtRrHdk4i4ciTzB5gHwBbFupgNnwaGdExi",

      "status": "success"
    },
    {

    }
  ],
  "id": "4f10d99a-e22e-4007-a3f0-6af3bc63acfe",
  "metadata": {
    "labels": [
      {
        "id": "0ec71594-de64-4794-acd7-9ace0b7137a3",
        "name": "aws-iot-integration-label",
        "organization_id": "0c3fbfb6-f8ed-4dbe-af7c-1a86bf372764"
      }
    ]
  },
  "name": "Sparkfun Pro RF",
  "payload": "AWcA8AJodANzJ18Ecc04B9CYMAWGyVCIuDaw",
  "port": 1,
  "reported_at": 1586466818
}
```

### Viewing Integration in AWS IoT Core

Once a label has been set up to connect our devices to our new Integration,
let's return to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), and go to
**IoT Core** under the **Services** menu:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-find-services.png"
  )}
/>

Here you are able to monitor the connections to AWS:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-monitor.png"
  )}
/>

When data comes in from the Helium Network Integration, Things will be
automatically created within AWS IoT Core:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-things.png"
  )}
/>

Going to **Interact** on the left while on a **Thing** takes us to a list of
topics for interacting with the **Thing Shadows**:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-interact.png"
  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-topics.png"
  )}
/>

To monitor in real-time what is being sent to AWS from Helium, we can open the
**MQTT monitor**, and subscribe to a topic with "\#" wildcard \(to catch all
messages, or use the topic we set in **Helium Console** if just wanting to
monitor those\).

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-mqtt-client.png"
  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-aws-iot-core-mqtt-message.png"
  )}
/>

The payload field is the actual data received from the device,
[encoded in a base64](https://www.base64decode.org/) string.

### Integration Details

View the details of your integration by clicking on the Integration name.

**Integration Details** shows the integration ID that is unique to each
integration, the name, the type of integration, and whether it is active or not.

**Devices Piped** lists all the devices that are currently sending their data to
the selected integration.

**Update your AWS Connection Details** allows you to update your AWS connection
details for the currently viewed integration.
