# Azure IoT Hub

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

[Microsoft Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/#overview) enables highly secure and reliable communication between your Internet of Things (IoT) application and the devices it manages.

## On Azure IoT Hub
Prior to setting up an integration in Console, the following Azure IoT Hub information is required:

- Hub Name
- Policy Name
- Primary Key

Log into your Azure IoT Hub account and on the left hand menu go to "Shared access policies".

Console requires the following permissions.
- Registry Read: query Azure for devices in your hub
- Registry Write: create devices in your hub
- Device Connect: send messages through http/mqtt to your azure device

:::important 
You must create your own policy and ensure it includes the permissions listed above. Although the `iothubowner` policy includes those by default it's not designed to be used for external integrations.
:::

Whatever policy you choose, click it and a pane will appear. Copy the `Primary Key` information.

## On Console
To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu.

Click the **Add** integration button.

Choose the **Azure IoT** integration icon.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-azure-helium-console.png"
  )}
/>

Enter the Azure IoT Hub information into the corresponding fields on Console:

- `Hostname` (enter IoT Hub Hub Name)
- `Shared Access Key Name` (enter IoT Hub Policy Name)
- `Shared Access Key` (enter IoT Hub Primary Key)

Remember the policy must have the following permissions enabled on your Azure IoT Hub: Registry Read, Registry Write, and Device Connect. 

## Adding a device
Every time the Azure IoT Hub integration starts up on Console, it will check if the device exists on IoT Hub, and if it doesnâ€™t it will create one.
