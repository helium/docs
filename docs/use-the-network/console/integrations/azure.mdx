# Azure IoT Hub

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

[Microsoft Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/#overview) enables highly
secure and reliable communication between your Internet of Things (IoT) application and the devices
it manages.

To help ensure stable device connectivity only use Console to connect to client ids. Other device
monitoring tools in IoT Hub will connect to the device using the same client id which will cause
connectivity instability.

For more information getting started with the Azure IoT Hub integration, check out our Tips & Tricks
video on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/emJ88cGF-Ew).

## On Azure IoT Hub

Prior to setting up an integration in Console, the following Azure IoT Hub information is required:
`Primary Connection String`.

The string can be found by clicking Device Explorer on the Azure IoT Hub and then clicking on your
device name.

Log into your Azure IoT Hub account and on the left hand menu go to "Shared access policies".

Console requires the following permissions.

- Registry Read: query Azure for devices in your hub
- Registry Write: create devices in your hub
- Device Connect: send messages through http/mqtt to your azure device

:::important

You must create your own policy and ensure it includes the permissions listed above. Although the
`iothubowner` policy includes those by default it's not designed to be used for external
integrations.

## On Console

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu.

Click the **Add** integration button.

/>

Choose the **Azure IoT** integration icon.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-azure-helium-console.png')}
/>

Enter the Azure IoT Hub `Primary Connection String` information into the Console. Once the string
has been added the following details will be automatically filled based on the information contained
in the string:

- `Hub Name`
- `Policy Name`
- `Primary Key`

Remember the Azure IoT Hub policy must have the following permissions enabled: Registry Read,
Registry Write, and Device Connect.

## Adding a device

Every time the Azure IoT Hub integration starts up on Console, it will check if the device exists on
IoT Hub, and if it doesn’t it will create one.

# Azure IoT Central

According to Microsoft, "Azure IoT Central is highly secure, scales with your business as it grows,
ensures your investments are repeatable, and integrates with your existing business apps." Read more
about Azure IoT Central [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central/).

## On Azure IoT Central

Prior to setting up an integration in Console, the following Azure IoT Central information is
required:

- API Key (role app administrator, note this is only shown one time so copy and keep in a safe,
  retrievable location)
- ID scope (from Device connection groups)
- App Name (obtained from your Azure IoT Central url `<appname>.azureiotcentral.com`)

## On Console

To add the integration in Console, go to Integrations on the left-hand menu.

Click the **Add** integration button.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-add-helium-console.png')}
/>

Choose the **Azure IoT Central** integration icon.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-azure-iot-central-icon.png',
  )}
/>

Enter the Azure IoT Central information into the Console:

- API Key
- Scope ID
- App Name

After providing a name and completing the integration, make sure the device/label is mapped to the
Azure IoT Central Integration on the Flows page.

More information about Flows [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/flows/).

:::important

Decoding of sensor data must occur prior to sending data to Azure IoT Central. More information on
Decoder Functions
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/functions#creating-a-decoder-function).
