# Cargo

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

:::info

[Helium Cargo](http://cargo.helium.com/) is an evaluation tool and the data collected is available
to all developers. Please do not share any sensitive information. Use at your own discretion.

:::

## Add a Cargo Integration

To add an integration, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the integration to add -
in this case, the **Cargo** integration.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-cargo.png')} />

The next step is to name the integration.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Worskpace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

:::info

Quick video tutorial connecting devices to an integration
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnERw1f7TGE).

:::

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/flows/).

## Cargo Endpoint

The Cargo endpoint is where device data is sent if connected with a Label.

**HTTP Details**

| key      | value                                   |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Method   | `post`                                  |
| Endpoint | `https://cargo.helium.com/api/payloads` |
| Headers  | `{"Content-Type":"application/json"}`   |

## Cargo Payload

The Cargo payload defines the content and structure of the data payload that must be sent to the
cargo endpoint from a device or separate application. Cargo currently accepts data from either the
`decoded` or the`payload` field. Each field has different requirements described below.

### Decoded Field

The `decoded` field is the preferred method for sending data to Cargo. This method requires the use
of a [Function Decoder](/use-the-network/console/functions/) on Console in order to decode the
device payload before sending it to Cargo. The accepted fields are listed below and can be located
at any depth within the `decoded` field.

| Required JSON Fields | Description          |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| latitude             | Latitude in Degrees  |
| longitude            | Longitude in Degrees |
| altitude             | Altitude in Meters   |

| Optional JSON Fields | Description     |
| :------------------- | :-------------- |
| speed                | Speed in mph    |
| battery              | Battery Voltage |

### Payload Field

Cargo is also capable of decoding the `payload` field, but is only compatible with a few common
tracking devices.

#### Compatible Devices:

- RAK 7200
- Dragino LGT-92
- Browan Object Locator
- Digital Matter Oyster & Yabby

You also have the option of encoding the required data on a development device before transmitting
it as described below.

**Total Payload:**

- 12 Bytes without Battery Voltage
- 14 Bytes with Battery Voltage

**Packed in the following order:**

- int32_t Latitude in Degrees
- int32_t Longitude in Degrees
- int16_t Elevation in Meters
- int16_t Speed in mph
- uint16_t Battery Voltage \(Optional\)

### Example:

```c
if (GPS.hasFix) {
    idx = 0;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.latitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.longitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (int)(GPS.altitude);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (int)(GPS.speed);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
}
```
