# Datacake

[Datacake](https://datacake.co) is a multi-purpose, low-code IoT platform that requires no programming skills and minimal time to create custom IoT applications. You can sign up for a free
account at [https://datacake.co](https://datacake.co).

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu.
Select the integration to add - in this case, the **Datacake** integration as
shown below.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-datacake-selectdatacake.png"
  )}
/>

To integrate Helium Console with Datacake, you'll need to input your **personal access token** from Datacake. When you register on the Datacake platform and create a user account, a token is automatically created.
You can view your own token via the User Settings Menu. You can reach this menu by clicking on "Edit Profile" at the end of the list using the Workspace Selector:


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-datacake-accessprofile.png"
  )}
/>

You will now see a menu where you can make your personal account settings. There is also a sidebar and in this you will find the item "API". If you click on it, you will find your personal access token there:


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-datacake-showapikey.png"
  )}
/>


Copy this value into the **Enter Datacake Token** field in Console for the integration configuration shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-datacake-enteraccesstoken.png"
  )}
/>

Set a name for the integration in step 3. You will use this name to
identify the integration when attaching it to devices. Simply calling the integration 'Datacake' is sufficient for most implementations.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-datacake-nameintegration.png"
  )}
/>

Optionally you can add this integration to a label beore pressing "Add Integration" to complete.


## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](../labels).
