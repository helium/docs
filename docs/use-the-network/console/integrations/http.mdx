# HTTP

## Add an HTTP Integration

To add a Integration, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **HTTP** integration.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-http.png"
  )}
/>

The next step is to paste the HTTP endpoint.

If you're still testing, you can find popular sites that can create HTTP
endpoints for you and inspect packets. [Requestbin](https://www.requestbin.com)
and [Beeceptor](https://www.beeceptor.com) provide tools to make an HTTP
endpoint quickly and easily.

### Uplink \(Receive Data from Device\)

Uplink refers to your device sending data to be received by the network. With
regards to the HTTP integration, this will be the device data that is sent to
your HTTP endpoint of choice.

### RequestBin Example

Create an endpoint by going to requestbin.com and click **Create a Request
Bin**. Once created, copy the endpoint.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-http-request-bin.png"
  )}
/>

... and paste it in Console.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-http-details.png"
  )}
/>

**HTTP Header** and **Value** are not required and those can be left blank.

Lastly, provide a name for the integration. Names do not have to be unique.

Click **Create Integration**.

Your new integration is now ready for use! Please read about the JSON schema to
understand how to parse data received.

### Integration Details

View the details of your integration by clicking on the Integration name.

**Integration Details** shows the integration ID that is unique to each
integration, the name, the type of integration, and whether it is active or not.

**HTTP Details** shows the specific endpoint. Editing endpoints is not available
in the SDK Beta and will be coming soon. If you no longer want to use an
integration, simply create a new one and redirect existing devices using the old
integration to use the new one.

**Devices Piped** lists all the devices that are currently sending their data to
the selected integration.

**Update your Connection Details** allows you to update your HTTP connection
details for the currently viewed integration.

## Downlink \(Send Data to Device\)

Downlink refers to the network sending data down to be received by your device.
With regards to the HTTP integration, this will be data sent to a unique URL
called the `downlink_url` provided by Console.

#### Downlink URL Format

`https://console.helium.com/api/v1/down/{Integration_ID}/{Downlink_Key}/{:optional_device_id}`

You can send downlinks to every device that your HTTP integration is attached to
or just a single device by including the device UUID at the end. You can find
this `downlink_url` with the required downlink key in it on the HTTP integration
page in the details section, an example is shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-http-downlink-details.png"
  )}
/>

The downlink URL can also be found in the uplink JSON message for that
particular device. It will look similar to the URL shown below. You can also
find it using the Debug window on your device page.

#### Downlink URL Example \(Sends to all Devices with Integration Attached\)

```text
"downlink_url": "https://console.helium.com/api/v1/down/897780bc-6980-42c1-a659-30077e8dbcd1/h4IxFDle6biV1ZKmrUJamaXhKjRRF3c-"
```

#### Downlink URL Example \(Device Specific\)

```text
"downlink_url": "https://console.helium.com/api/v1/down/897780bc-6980-42c1-a659-30077e8dbcd1/h4IxFDle6biV1ZKmrUJamaXhKjRRF3c-/d2c7b8dc-221a-4ec8-aedd-6c19ae348a33"
```

To send the downlink message, make a POST request including a JSON body with the
following fields shown below, see more details on the fields
[here](/use-the-network/console/integrations/json-schema#downlink-transmitting-data-to-a-device).

#### Downlink JSON Message Example

```text
{
    "payload_raw": "SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==",
    "port": 1,
    "confirmed": false
}
```

### Downlink Tool Example

The easiest way to send a downlink to your device is to use the built-in
downlink tool in Console. You will find it on the right side of every device
page, as shown below. In order to use the downlink tool, you must have an HTTP
integration attached to the device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-http-downlink-button.png"
  )}
/>

Once you have the downlink tool open, you can input the downlink payload string
in the payload field. Select _Encoded_ if you are inputting a string that is
already Base64 encoded, and _Plain_ if it is plain text. Last, select your
Fport, whether or not you want to send a confirmed downlink, and click the
downlink send button as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-http-downlink-tool-expanded.png"
  )}
/>

Once you have initiated the downlink, you should see the downlink event show in
the event log, as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-http-downlink-event.png"
  )}
/>

### Postman Example

Postman is a popular developer utility for HTTP based services, you can download
it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). We can use this utility to easily
make a POST request to the downlink URL with our downlink JSON message. Follow
the steps below to successfully send your downlink message to your device.

1. Select the type of HTTP request, POST in this case.
2. Enter the downlink URL here.
3. Select Body to begin entering your message details.
4. Select `raw` as your body type.
5. Select `JSON` as the body format.
6. Enter your JSON message with the required fields.
7. Finally press `Send` to transmit the message.
8. You should see a response of `Downlink scheduled` if successful.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. You can read more about how to do
that [here](/use-the-network/console/labels).
