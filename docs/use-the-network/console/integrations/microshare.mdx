To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu.
Select the integration to add - in this case, the **Microshare** integration as
shown below.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-microshare.png"
  )}
/>

Now we need to go over to the **Microshare** console and get our Pipe Token.

In the ***Microshare*** console, click on "Keys" at the bottom-left, then "Create New App" in the upper-right.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-microshare-app.png"
  )}
/>

Now, we give it a name - in this case, we simply call it "Helium Console" and click "Create App".

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-microshare-newapp.png"
  )}
/>

Click on the "Generate a Token" button, select "Pipe Token" and click the "Create Token" button.

  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-microshare-newtoken2.png"
  )}
/>

Now that the token is generated, let's copy it so that we can enter it into the Helium Console.
Select the "Tokens" tab at the top of the screen, then click the Token itself to copy it to your clipboard.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-microshare-newtoken3.png"
  )}
/>

Finally, let's paste in the token from **Microshare** in step 2 and name the integration in step 3. You will use this name to
identify the integration when attaching it to devices.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](../labels).
