# Microshare

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

[Microshare](https://www.microshare.io/) is a data leverage platform for the IoT era, providing a
solution to sharing, privacy, security, audit, confidentiality, data monetization and cost savings.
You can sign up for a free account at [https://www.microshare.io/](https://www.microshare.io/).

To add the integration in Console, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **Microshare** integration as shown below.

/>

Now we need to go over to the **Microshare** console and get our Pipe Token.

In the **_Microshare_** console, click on "Keys" at the bottom-left, then "Create New App" in the
upper-right.

Now, we give it a name - in this case, we simply call it "Helium Console" and click "Create App".

/>

Click on the "Generate a Token" button, select "Pipe Token" and click the "Create Token" button.

/>

/>

Now that the token is generated, let's copy it so that we can enter it into the Helium Console.
Select the "Tokens" tab at the top of the screen, then click the Token itself to copy it to your
clipboard.

/>

Finally, let's paste in the token from **Microshare** in step 2 and name the integration in step 3.
You will use this name to identify the integration when attaching it to devices.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Worskpace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/flows/).
