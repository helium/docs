# MQTT

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

## Add an MQTT Integration

To add an integration, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the integration to add -
in this case, the **MQTT** integration.

The next step is to paste your MQTT broker endpoint, and optional topic prefix.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Worskpace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

:::

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/flows/).

## MQTT Topic composition:

### Device Uplink \(Receive Data from Device\)

**Subscribe to:** `{optional_prefix}/helium/{Device ID}/rx`

Example with prefix: `mqtt/helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx` Example without prefix:
`helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx`

### Device Downlink \(Send Data to Device\)

**Publish to:** `{optional_prefix}/helium/{Device ID}/tx`

Example with prefix: `mqtt/helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx` Example without prefix:
`helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx`

## MQTT Messages

The MQTT for downlink and uplink follow the
[JSON schema documented here.](/use-the-network/console/integrations/json-schema)

## Send and Receive Device Data

The following examples are done with the [MQTT CLI](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli) utility.

Example MQTT

**Subscribe to Uplink Packets:**

```text
mqtt sub -V 3 -t helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx -h {mqtt_broker_host} -p {mqtt_broker_host_port} -u "user" -pw "password"
```

**Publish Downlink Packet:**

```text
mqtt pub -V 3 -t helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx -h {mqtt_broker_host} -p {mqtt_broker_host_port} -u "user" -pw "password" -m "{\"payload_raw\":\"encoded_string\"}"
```
