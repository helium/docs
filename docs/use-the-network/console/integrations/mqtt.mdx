# MQTT

## Add an MQTT Integration

To add an integration, go to **Integrations** on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add - in this case, the **MQTT** integration.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-mqtt.png"
  )}
/>

The next step is to paste your MQTT broker endpoint, and optional topic prefix.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](/use-the-network/console/labels).

## MQTT Topic composition:

### Device Uplink \(Receive Data from Device\)

**Subscribe to:** `{optional_prefix}/helium/{Device ID}/rx`

Example with prefix: `mqtt/helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx`  
Example without prefix: `helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx`

### Device Downlink \(Send Data to Device\)

**Publish to:** `{optional_prefix}/helium/{Device ID}/tx`

Example with prefix: `mqtt/helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx`  
Example without prefix: `helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx`

## MQTT Messages

The MQTT for downlink and uplink follow the
[JSON schema documented here.](/use-the-network/console/integrations/json-schema)

## Send and Receive Device Data

The following examples are done with the
[MQTT CLI](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli) utility.

Example MQTT

**Subscribe to Uplink Packets:**

```text
mqtt sub -V 3 -t helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx -h {mqtt_broker_host} -p {mqtt_broker_host_port} -u "user" -pw "password"
```

**Publish Downlink Packet:**

```text
mqtt pub -V 3 -t helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx -h {mqtt_broker_host} -p {mqtt_broker_host_port} -u "user" -pw "password" -m "{\"payload_raw\":\"encoded_string\"}"
```
