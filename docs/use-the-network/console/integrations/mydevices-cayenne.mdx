# MyDevices Cayenne

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

[Cayenne](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/features/) from
[myDevices](https://mydevices.com/), is a free, drag and drop IoT project builder, that empowers
developers, designers and engineers to quickly prototype and share their connected device projects.
Cayenne was designed to help users create Internet of Things prototypes and then bring them to
production. It supports
[hundreds of devices](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/supported-hardware/), including
everything from popular development boards to professional grade remote sensors. Cayenne offers both
a web and mobile based application.

### Add a myDevices Cayenne Integration

To add a **myDevices Cayenne** Integration, go to Integrations on the left-hand menu. Select the
integration to add, in this case, the **myDevices Cayenne** integration:

/>

The next step is to name the integration

:::info **Downlink Not Yet Supported**

The MyDevices integration currently only supports uplinks. Downlinks are in the process of being
implemented and will be available soon.

:::

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices or groups of devices (via labels) can be directly connected to integrations on the Flows
Worskpace. Labels are identifiers used to group devices for easy management. To connect one or more
devices to one or more integrations, simply connect the Device and Integration nodes on the Flows
Workspace.

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnERw1f7TGE).

:::

Node elements (devices, labels, integrations) need to be created before they're available on the
Flows Workspace. More information about Flows
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/flows/).

### Adding Your Device on myDevices Cayenne

Before adding your device to Cayenne, be sure you've successfully added it to the Helium network as
well as connected it the myDevices Cayenne integration. If you haven't done so yet, start
[here](../adding-devices). Once you have a device added on Console and you have verified that
packets are being received, you can then proceed to add the device on Cayenne.

First, signup for Cayenne [here](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/signup/), if you have not
already.

From the Cayenne dashboard, click **Add New** &gt; **Device / Widget**.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-mydevices-cayenne-add-new.jpg',
  )}
/>

From the list of devices & widgets that appears, click **LoRa** and select the **Helium** Network
option to view a list of Helium supported devices.

:::warning **Ensure you have selected the Helium Network**

You must select the Helium Network **before** searching for your device, else you may add your
device on the wrong network and will not receive data.

Here we've selected the popular
[STM32 B-L072Z-LRWAN1 ](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html)LoRaWAN
development board.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-mydevices-cayenne-select-st.png',
  )}
/>

The only information you'll need once you've selected your device is to enter the **DevEUI**, which
is found on your device details page on Console, shown below.

    'img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-mydevices-cayenne-device-details.png',
  )}
/>

### Downlinks

Your device first needs to report an Actuator, either Digital or Analog one. You can check LPP doc
here
[https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/\#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload-overview](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload-overview)

Once the device starts reporting DigitalActuator or AnalogActuator, you will automatically get a
button or a slider on Cayenne UI. Using that new control will then trigger downlink commands.

Please note that both Actuators types inherit from AnalogSensor DataType, e.g. using 2-byte integers
with 0.01 precision. This means a Digital Actuator set to HIGH from the UI will trigger a Downlink
with the value = 0x0064 = 100.

### Device Data Payload Format

When adding your device on Cayenne, you'll need to pay close attention to whether or not the device
requires the Cayenne Low Power Payload \(CayenneLPP\). If your device is in the list of supported
devices, it will specify whether or not it requires CayenneLPP directly above the name field when
you've selected the device, and shown in the Cayenne dashboard image above. If you do not see the
line 'This device uses Cayenne LPP', then it is automatically supported by Cayenne. You can find the
official documentation on CayenneLPP
[here](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload), as well
as a popular Arduino library [here](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/CayenneLPP). If you have a
custom device or it is not in the list of supported devices, then select the
[STM32 B-L072Z-LRWAN1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html) board as a
placeholder, and be sure to use CayenneLPP formatting in your firmware.
