# MyDevices Cayenne

[Cayenne](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/features/) from
[myDevices](https://mydevices.com/), is a free, drag and drop IoT project
builder, that empowers developers, designers and engineers to quickly prototype
and share their connected device projects. Cayenne was designed to help users
create Internet of Things prototypes and then bring them to production. It
supports
[hundreds of devices](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/supported-hardware/),
including everything from popular development boards to professional grade
remote sensors. Cayenne offers both a web and mobile based application.

### Add a myDevices Cayenne Integration

To add a **myDevices Cayenne** Integration, go to Integrations on the left-hand
menu. Select the integration to add, in this case, the **myDevices Cayenne**
integration:

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-mydevices.png"
  )}
/>

The next step is to name the integration

Last, apply any optional Labels. For more information on Labels please visit the
[Labels guide](../labels).

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

:::info 
**Downlink Not Yet Supported**  
The MyDevices integration currently only supports uplinks. Downlinks are in the
process of being implemented and will be available soon. 
:::

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](../labels).

### Adding Your Device on myDevices Cayenne

Before adding your device to Cayenne, be sure you've successfully added it to
the Helium network as well as attached it to a label that is also attached to
the Cayenne integration, if you haven't done so yet, then see how to
[here](../adding-devices). Once you have a device added on Console and you have
verified that packets are being received, you can then proceed to add the device
on Cayenne.

First, signup for Cayenne
[here](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/signup/), if you have not
already.

From the Cayenne dashboard, click **Add New** &gt; **Device / Widget**.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-mydevices-cayenne-add-new.jpg"
  )}
/>

From the list of devices & widgets that appears, click **LoRa** and select the
**Helium** Network option to view a list of Helium supported devices.


:::warning
**Ensure you have selected the Helium Network**  
You must select the Helium Network **before** searching for your device, else you may add your device on the wrong network and will not receive data.

Here we've selected the popular
[STM32 B-L072Z-LRWAN1 ](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html)LoRaWAN
development board.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-mydevices-cayenne-select-st.png"
  )}
/>

The only information you'll need once you've selected your device is to enter
the **DevEUI**, which is found on your device details page on Console, shown
below.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-mydevices-cayenne-device-details.png"
  )}

### Downlinks

Your device first needs to report an Actuator, either Digital or Analog one. You
can check LPP doc here
[https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/\#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload-overview](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload-overview)

Once the device starts reporting DigitalActuator or AnalogActuator, you will
automatically get a button or a slider on Cayenne UI. Using that new control
will then trigger downlink commands.

Please note that both Actuators types inherit from AnalogSensor DataType, e.g.
using 2-byte integers with 0.01 precision. This means a Digital Actuator set to
HIGH from the UI will trigger a Downlink with the value = 0x0064 = 100.

### Device Data Payload Format

When adding your device on Cayenne, you'll need to pay close attention to
whether or not the device requires the Cayenne Low Power Payload \(CayenneLPP\).
If your device is in the list of supported devices, it will specify whether or
not it requires CayenneLPP directly above the name field when you've selected
the device, and shown in the Cayenne dashboard image above. If you do not see
the line 'This device uses Cayenne LPP', then it is automatically supported by
Cayenne. You can find the official documentation on CayenneLPP
[here](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload),
as well as a popular Arduino library
[here](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/CayenneLPP). If you have a custom
device or it is not in the list of supported devices, then select the
[STM32 B-L072Z-LRWAN1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html)
board as a placeholder, and be sure to use CayenneLPP formatting in your
firmware.
