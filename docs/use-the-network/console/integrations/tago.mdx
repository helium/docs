# Tago.IO

[Tago.IO](https://tago.io/) combines advanced device management, services, data storage, visualization, and analytics with an easy to implement cloud-based IoT platform.

You can sign up for a free account at [https://tago.io](https://tago.io/).

To get started, log in to your Tago.IO account and click **Devices** from the menu on the left:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-data-plugins03.png"
  )}
/>

Generate a new **Authorization Token** by entering any name on the **Token name** field and click
the **Generate token** button.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-generate-token.png"
  )}
/>

Now we simply copy the **Authorization Token** by clicking on the **Copy** icon:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-copy-token.png"
  )}
/>

At this point, we move back over to the Helium Console to complete the Integration.

Click on **Integrations** on the menu on the left and select the **Tago.IO** Prebuilt Integration:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-integrations.png"
  )}
/>

Paste the **Tago.IO Authorization Token** that we copied from the Tago.IO site above and enter a name for our Integration:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-integrations-create.png"
  )}
/>

Then we add a new label to our Integration to allow us to bind it to devices:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-integrations-label.png"
  )}
/>

You should now see a verification message that the Integration was created successfully:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-tago-integration-success.png"
  )}
/>

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](../labels).
