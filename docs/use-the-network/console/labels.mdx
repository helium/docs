# Labels

Labels are a powerful mechanism used in Helium Console to organize devices,
assign integrations, and provide scalability and flexibility to managing your
projects.

## Organizing and Connecting with Labels

Devices can be both organized and connected to Integrations with the use of
Labels. Labels are simply user defined identifiers, that can be attached to one
or more devices, and one or more Integrations. Also multiple Labels can be added
to a single device so users can choose to identify devices based on attributes
such as geography \(e.g. `SF`\) and device type \(e.g. `temperature` or
`humidity`\).

Labels provide flexibility to define where to send data from devices. Users can
apply a Label to an Integration and that Label can be used to connect a single
or multiple devices to that Integration. For example, users could define an
internal server as an Integration for initial testing and apply a descriptive
Label \(e.g. `internal_test`\). After ensuring devices send data, that
`internal_test` Label could easily be replaced by one that maps to a production
endpoint \(AWS\).

## Add Labels

When creating devices and integrations on Console, you will have the option to
attach a custom Label to it. Before adding Labels to devices and integrations,
you must create a new Label. To add a new Label, navigate to the **Labels** page
using the left side navigation, and then click **Create New Label** in the upper
right. You will be presented with the screen below.

## Attaching Labels

Labels can be attached to devices and integrations during or after creation. If
you would like to attach a label to a device or integration during creation,
make sure to create the label before hand, and it will be available to select.
If you would like to attach a label after creating a new device or integration,
go to the specific device or integration details page and find the label
attachment dropdown to apply.

## Swapping Labels

Labels can be swapped for other labels on devices. For example, devices that were
originally in the San Francisco office had an **SF** label, but they were then moved
to the Chicago office and now require a **Chicago** label. This can easily be
accomplished by selecting the label that you wish to swap using the checkboxes on the left:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/console/console-swap-label-step01.png")} />

Select **Swap Selected Label** from the **Quick Action** dropdown:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/console/console-swap-label-step02.png")} />

Select which label you wish to swap into place:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/console/console-swap-label-step03.png")} />

Confirm your choice:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/console/console-swap-label-step04.png")} />

You will get a confirmation here:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/console/console-swap-label-step06.png")} />

And you can now see by the number of devices that the new label has been swapped in.

## Labels Settings

Users can managed per-label settings across devices and integrations using the **Label Settings** button
in the top right corner when viewing an individual label. Only users with
administrator-level privileges can change label settings.

### General

Under **General** settings, configure a label's name and its color as it
appears on the left side of the Dashboard.

### Packet

Configure the **Packet** settings to adjust how many copies of each packet you
want to receive. By default, the Network will deliver the packet with the best
signal strength, and for most applications this is probably adequate. However,
for purposes of redundancy or location analysis, users might want to request
more than one distinct packet from Hotspots when available.

:::important

Each additional packet requested will result in additional data credit fees paid
to the Network by your Helium Console organization.

### Notifications

Helium Console will deliver email-based notifications for various events that
happen for devices in a given label. For each notification, either
`Administrators`, `Managers`, or both can be notified via email. The current
list of supported notifications are:

- When a device is deleted from an organization
- When an integration containing devices has been deleted
- When an integration with devices has been updated

  )}
/>

### Adaptive Data Rate

To allow ADR for one device or a group of devices, simply toggle the `Allow ADR`
in your Label settings. You can either create a Label strictly for managing ADR,
or adjust the setting on a Label you already have attached to your devices.
