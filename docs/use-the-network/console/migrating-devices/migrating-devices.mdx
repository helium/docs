# Migrating Devices to Helium

If you already have LoRaWAN devices deployed on another network, you can easily migrate them to the
Helium Network. Typically this only involves adding your existing `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey`
to a new device in the Helium Console.

The following is a list of network-specific migration guides. Join us!

### When Migrating Devices for the First Time

As network usage increases, a mechanism called the XOR filter allows the Console backend (router) to
only process known traffic and avoid spending resources on unfamiliar packets, which significantly
improves performance.

However, the first time a device joins the network its keys need to be added to the blockchain and
the updated block propagated to the miners (Hotspots).

This initial join process could take up to 20 mins depending on:

- when this transaction (batched with others) gets added to the blockchain
- the overall performance of the blockchain

After the initial join takes place future rejoining of the same device will be much quicker.

Helium Console users are capped at ONE (1) Organization and 10 devices for their account.

If your account as of March 31, 2022 exceeds this cap, you can continue using Helium Console with
those existing devices and Orgs for 12 calendar months, but will not be able to add additional
devices and Orgs.

To continue with more than 1 Org / 10 devices after 12 months, you will need to work with a member
of the ecosystem, host your own instance, or contact a team members at sales@nova-labs.com.

\*While an account is in an overage state with > 1 Org / 10 devices and a device or Org is deleted,
additional devices or Orgs cannot be re-added.

Users over the cap who would like to immediately add more devices/Organizations, or users who have
not yet exceeded the cap but plan to do so, can reach out to members of the ecosystem, host their
own instance, or contact sales@nova-labs.com.
