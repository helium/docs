# Migrating Devices to Helium

If you already have LoRaWAN devices deployed on another network, you can easily
migrate them to the Helium Network. Typically this only involves adding your
existing `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey` to a new device in the Helium Console.

The following is a list of network-specific migration guides. Join us!
