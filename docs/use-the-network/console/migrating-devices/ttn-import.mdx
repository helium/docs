# Import Devices From The Things Network

Helium Console now supports importing devices from The Things Network directly
from the web interface.

This guide will walk you through the process of migrating devices from TTN over
to Helium. As you'll see the, process is quite painless.

## Starting the Import Process

To get started, open up the [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) and
switch to the Organization that you want to import the devices into:

    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-console-org.png"
  )}
/>

Next, move to the "Devices" tab and select the _Import Devices_ button in the
upper-right of the Console.

    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-console-devices.png"
  )}
/>

## Retrieving a TTN Access Code

Next we need to retrieve a code from The Things Network that will allow us to
manage devices programatically.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-console-input-access-code.png"
  )}
/>

Go to
[https://account.thethingsnetwork.org](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/)
and enter your TTN Console credentials.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-login.png"
  )}
/>

At this point, you should be taken to our account page on the TTN Console. Click
the link directly beneath your avatar, and you will be given a
`ttnctl access code` that should be valid for the next five minutes.

    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-find-access-code.png"
  )}
/>

##

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-access-code.png"
  )}
/>

Copy this code over to our _Import Devices_ page back on the Helium Console and
click the "Start Importing Devices" button!

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-console-input-access-code-2.png"
  )}
/>

## Select the devices to Migrate

Next, select the devices you want to migrate from The Things Network to the
Helium Network. We encourage you to move them all.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-select-applications-1.png"
  )}
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-select-applications-2.png"
  )}
/>

As shown in the screenshot above, we include the option to auto-create a
[Helium label ](../labels#organizing-and-connecting-with-labels)based on the TTN
Application name. As you'll see momentarily, his can be very convenient and is
recommended.

We can also delete the devices from The Things Network so that your device will
no longer attempt to join TTN rather than Helium.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-label.png"
  )}
/>

Now we simply click the "Import Devices" button, and wait a few seconds as the
devices are pulled over into your Helium Console!

In the example migrated device below, you can see the attached label that was
created from the TTN Application name.

:::info  
Once your devices are organized using Labels, you can address them
programmatically via the Console API. 
:::

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/console/migrating-devices/ttn-import-console-details.png"
  )}
/>

And you're done. That is all that it takes to migrate devices from The Things
Network over to The People's Network!
