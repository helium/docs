# Console Account Settings 

## Console 2FA

Two Factor Authentication, usually written `2FA`, provides a higher level of security for your Helium Console account by requiring a separate, one-time use password in 
addition to your primary password that's always required. Helium Console features 2FA and we recommend you turn it on. 

To enable it, start by logging in and [heading to your profile](https://console.helium.com/profile). Click `Enroll in 2FA`. From there, you'll be guided to provision the 2GA application of your choosing. ([Authy](https://authy.com/), Google Authenticator, [1Password](https://1password.com/), and [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) are a few of the popular apps that make 2FA easy.)

:::important 

During the 2FA setup process, you'll be provided a backup code. This is what you'll need to regain access to your account in the event that you lose access to your 2FA application. Do not lose this backup code. Otherwise you'll be locked out of your account if you lose access to your 2FA application.

## Console API Keys 

To use the [Helium Console API](/api/console), you'll need an API Key. API Keys are organization- and role-specific.

To generate an API Key, once logged in, navigate to your [Console Account Settings](https://console.helium.com/profile). In the **Your API Keys** section, create a name for your new API Key,  select the role for this key (currently only `Admin` is supported), and click **Generate Key**. You'll then see a pop up with your API Key. This will be the only time it's revealed to you. 

:::important 

Once Console shows you your API key, it won't be shown to you again. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.

:::

After generating the API Key, it will not be active. You'll see it listed in the table as `Active`:`False`.  To activate it, you'll need to confirm activation via the email Console will send you once the key is created. After confirming, you'll see the status as `Active`:`True`.

Now that you've generated an API key, put it to use! Head over to the [Console API docs](/api/console) to get started.
