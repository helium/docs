# Console Quickstart

## Objective

This Console quickstart guide will cover how to:

- Register an account on Helium Console
- Add a device to Helium Console and record device details

:::info 
The cost per packet is $0.00001 USD \(24 byte packets\) which is
equivalent to 1 Data Credit \(DC\). For more information please go
[here](https://github.com/helium/devdocs/tree/861823eb00b0643fe6ca03067de7fe9409dce149/longfi/data-credits/README.md).
:::

## Create an account

To register for an account, visit [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com)
and click **Register**.

During Registration, you'll be asked to provide an Organization name and a Team
name.

Define an Organization name for the top level owner of the account \(i.e. company
name\). Think of Teams as a way to organize groups of devices.

### Confirm your account

A confirmation email will be sent to the email address used to create an
account. You must confirm the account in order to continue using Console. If you
did not receive an email, please check your spam folders.

## Device Management

Helium Console allows developers to add devices and grab the device identifiers
to load onto their device firmware that authenticates and identifies the device
for the Helium Network.

### Add a Device

To add a device, go to **Devices** and click the **+ Add Device** icon on the
top right of the window.

When prompted, enter a name for your device. Device names do not have to be
unique \(as every device will be given a unique identifier generated by
Console\). `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey` are auto generated by the Helium
Console when you create a new device. However, you can input your own `DevEUI`,
`AppEUI`, and `AppKey` if your device is already provisioned with these
credentials.

Once added, you'll see a consolidated view of all your device details, as well
as the Activation Method \(only `OTAA` is currently supported\) and the LoRaWAN
US Channels used by the Helium Network \(which will always be `sub-band 2`\).

## Live Data and Event Logs

When a valid data packet is received from that device, a dot will appear from
the left side of the chart and flow towards the right as time goes on.

Blue dots represent packets that have been successfully sent to endpoints, while
orange dots have failed to reach an endpoint, and red dots do not have a defined
endpoint.

The size of the dot is related to the size of the packet. Larger sized packets
will be a larger dot, and small data packets will be a smaller dot.

### Event Log

Event Logs display real-time packets in table form. Here you can see which
Hotspot received the packet, its RSSI, and the size of the packet in bytes.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on labels [here](/use-the-network/console/labels).

## Next Steps

Now that you have learned how to add a device on Console it's time to get an
actual device connected. We have several quickstart guides for some of the most
popular development and ready to use devices
[here](/use-the-network/devices).
