# Users and Organizations

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

This section describes the system of Users and Organizations within Helium Console. At a high level:

- A `user` is someone registered for Console via their email address.
- An `organization` can have any number of `users`.
- A `user` can be part of any number of `organizations`.

## User Roles

The first user to register a new organization is given the highest role of `Administrator`.

### User Role Definitions

User permissions and privileges are as follows:

**Administrator**

- Manage Devices
- Manage Flows
- Manage Labels
- Manage Data Credits
- Manage Users
- Manage API Keys

**Manager**

- Manage Devices
- Manage Flows
- Manage Labels

**Read-Only**

- View Devices

### Managing Users

If you're an administrator, you can manage users for your organizations. To add a new user, once
logged in, [navigate to the Users page](https://console.helium.com/users) and then click **+ Add
User** in the upper right. You will be presented with a pop-up that asks you to supply the email of
the new user, and select their desired access level. Once you've done this, hit **Submit** and they
will be invited to join the organization via email.

## Organizations

An Organization is created when first registering an account. All Organizations of which you're a
member can be [viewed and managed from here](https://console.helium.com/organizations). From this
screen you can switch between Organizations, delete Organizations (with appropriate permissions),
view your DC balances, and make all devices for an organization either `Active` or `Inactive`(with
appropriate permissions).

Users can add additional Organizations by navigating to the **Dashboard** page using the left side
navigation, and then click **+ Add Organization** in the upper right. To switch to another
Organization click the **Switch** button on the list of Organizations on the **Dashboard** page.

:::important

Helium Console users are capped at ONE (1) Organization and 10 devices for their account.

If your account as of March 31, 2022 exceeds this cap, you can continue using Helium Console with
those existing devices and Orgs for 12 calendar months, but will not be able to add additional
devices and Orgs.

To continue with more than 1 Org / 10 devices after 12 months, you will need to work with a member
of the ecosystem, host your own instance, or contact a team members at sales@nova.xyz.

\*While an account is in an overage state with > 1 Org / 10 devices and a device or Org is deleted,
additional devices or Orgs cannot be re-added.

### Organization Migration

The Organization Migration feature allows users to transfer Organization configurations to another
Console hosted instance.

For example, if a user wants to migrate their Organization from a Console instance hosted by one
provider to another or to their own hosted version of Console.

Data Credit balances are not transferable and will not be migrated.

Migrating Organizations requires exporting the desired Organization by saving the JSON configuration
file to disk, and then importing that file on the new Console instance.

instance.

### Importing Organizations

Importing an Organization can be performed upon first login for the new Console instance or later
from the Organizations section.

duplicate devices exist on the new Console instance. This will allow devices to join on the new
Console instance.
