# Users and Organizations

This section describes the system of Users and Organizations within Helium Console. At a high level:

* A `user` is someone registered for Console via their email address.
* An `organization` can have any number of `users`.
* A `user` can be part of any number of `organizations`.


## User Roles

The first user to register a new organization is given the highest role of
`Administrator`. 

### User Role Definitions

User permissions and privileges are as follows:

**Administrator**
* Manage Devices
* Manage Labels
* Manage Data Credits
* Manage Users
* Manage API Keys

**Manager**
* Manage Devices
* Manage Labels

**Read-Only**
* View Devices

### Managing Users  

If you're an administrator, you can manage users for your organizations. To add a new user, once logged in, [navigate to the Users page](https://console.helium.com/users) and then click **+ Add User** in the upper right. You will be presented with a pop-up that asks you to supply the email of the new user, and select their desired access level. Once you've done this, hit **Submit** and they will be invited to join the organization via email. 
  
 
## Organizations

An Organization is created when first registering an account. All Organizations of which you're a member can be [viewed and managed from here](https://console.helium.com/organizations). From this screen you can switch between Organizations, delete Organizations (with appropriate permissions), view your DC balances, and make all devices for an organization either `Active` or `Inactive`(with appropriate permissions). 

Users can add additional Organizations by navigating to the **Dashboard** page using the left side
navigation, and then click **+ Add Organization** in the upper right. To switch
to another Organization click the **Switch** button on the list of Organizations
on the **Dashboard** page.
