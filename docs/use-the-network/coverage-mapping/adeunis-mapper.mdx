# Adeunis Mapper

## Mapping Tips

- Only operate at an above ground level of 1-2 meters, otherwise your data will
  not be representative of most real world devices.
- The device is configured with an uplink interval of five seconds, sufficient
  for mapping on foot or in a moving vehicle.

## Device Instructions

### Charging

The device is rechargeable via a micro USB connector located on the bottom. It
will charge automatically in the ON or OFF state. The device can be used while
charging. Any charger supplying 5V and at least 500mA is sufficient.

  )}
/>

If the battery is completely empty, it will be necessary to recharge the device
for 6 hours in order for it to be fully charged.

### Operating Procedure

Follow all the steps provided below for step-by-step instructions on how to
properly operate the field test device.

:::important
 You must power on the device in a location with coverage in order
for the device to first join the network. If the device is not able to join, it
will never begin sending uplinks. 
:::

First, power the device On by flipping the switch on the bottom of the device
into the ON position.

  )}
/>

After you are presented with the start screen, you will see the join screen.

Start Screen

  )}
/>

Join Screen

Press _Push Button 2,_ shown below, once to navigate to the GPS screen, also
shown below. If the backlight is off, you will have to press the button twice,
once to turn the backlight back on and another time to navigate to the next
screen.

Push Button 2

  )}

GPS Screen

Once you have navigated to the GPS screen you'll next be monitoring this screen
to validate that the device has a sufficient GPS fix (enough satellites are
visible to accurately calculate its position and time). Make sure the device is
located in a place where a good amount of the sky is visible. Once your device
obtains a fix (this may take a few minutes), you will see a latitude and
longitude show as well as how many satellites are visible. It's best if six or
more satellites are visible. You can now navigate to the Packet Count screen by
again pressing the same _Push Button 2_, once if the display backlight is on,
and twice if it is off.

:::important
Ignore the PER % number as shown in the packet count screen below.
This value is not meaningful for the current configuration. Only pay attention
to the UL\(Uplink\) Count.

  )}

Packet Count Screen

Once you see a positive number in the UL Count field, you have successfully
joined the network and are now transmitting packets with location data. At this
point you are ready to begin mapping new area. Read about how you can view your
location live with Helium Cargo below! When you are finished, simply switch the
power switch to OFF.

## Viewing on Cargo

When your device is transmitting packets with a valid GPS fix your device will
be visible on [cargo.helium.com](https://cargo.helium.com/). The device names
are in the format of _Mapper \#_, with the number being that which is displayed
on the front of your device with a label as shown below. The Avg Speed,
Elevation, and Voltage will always show zero, as these values were not included.

    "img/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/adeunis-mapper-adeunis-cargo.png"
  )}
/>

When you click on your device on the left, you will see a details window pop up
in the right top of the window. Here you can click on the _Sequence No_ box
shown below to get a time series view of each packet that was received in
sequence as well as the Hotspot that received it. The sequence number should
match the _UL Count_ on the _Packet Count_ screen shown on the device, although
it will likely be a few seconds delayed. The sequence number will start from
zero after each power cycle of the device.

You can also click on the _RSSI_ box shown below to view a time series view
again, but with the signal strength and Hotspot that received each packet.
