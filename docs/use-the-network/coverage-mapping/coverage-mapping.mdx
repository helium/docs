## Coverage Mapping

Helium recently began an effort to collect device data for the purpose of coverage mapping from voluntary community contributors. Mapping data is viewable at [mappers.helium.com](https://mappers.helium.com/). Anyone can contribute to this project by sending device uplinks with the required geographical data to the [Mappers API](mappers-api). For a step by step guide on setting an integration in Console see the [Mappers Quickstart](/docs/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart).
