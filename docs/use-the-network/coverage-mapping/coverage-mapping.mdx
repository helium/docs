# Coverage Mapping
The Mappers coverage mapping project is a crowd-sourced effort to build a cohesive, worldwide coverage map of the Helium network.

Mapping data is viewable at [mappers.helium.com](https://mappers.helium.com/). The Mappers tool allows you to see the areas that 
have been explored by voluntary community mappers and the Helium hotspots that have provided coverage to those areas.

Be sure to check out the ongoing conversation in the dedicated #mappers channel on the [Helium Discord 
Server](https://discord.gg/helium).
