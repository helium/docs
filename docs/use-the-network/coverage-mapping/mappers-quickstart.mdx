# Mappers Quickstart

This guide will show you step by step how to contribute data to the Mappers
project with an off-the-shelf tracker. This guide will use the
[Dragino LGT92](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/142-lgt-92.html), but
any LoRaWAN compatible tracker will work.

### Steps

1. Add device to Console.
2. Create new Label and HTTP integration with Mappers API ingest endpoint.
3. Create Function Decoder to decode device payload and attach to Label created
   in first step.
4. Attach Label to tracking device and verify data is being sent successfully.

### 1. Add Device to Console

To start, you'll need to add your device to Console. You should have been
provided with a DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey from the seller of the device.
Follow our [quickstart](/use-the-network/console/quickstart) for instructions on how to add a new device to
Console.

### 2. Create HTTP Integration

To start, we'll create a new HTTP integration in Console. Navigate to the
Integrations page using the left navigation and then select the HTTP
integration.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-http.png"
  )}
/>

Next we'll fill in the details, see instructions and image below.

1. Enter the Mappers API Ingest endpoint
   `https://mappers.helium.wtf/api/v1/ingest`
2. Enter the name for this Integration: _Mappers Integration_
3. Create and apply a Label for this Integration, we've used the same name as
   the integration.
4. Finally, click _Create Integration_ to complete.

    "img/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-http-integration.png"
  )}
/>

### 3. Create Function Decoder

Next, we'll be creating a Function decoder to decode the payload from the device
and properly format it for the API endpoint. The decoder is specific to the
encoding scheme used to encode the data before the device transmits it. For off-the-shelf 
devices this is usually manufacturer specific. For development devices,
[CayenneLPP](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload)
if often used. For this guide we'll be using a decoder specifically made for
this tracking device and slightly modifying it by adding two additional required
fields. The original decoder can be found from the manufacturer's website
[here](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/downloads/LGT_92/Decoder/LGT92-v1.5.0_decoder_20191129.txt).

To start, navigate to the Functions page using the left navigation and then
click _Create New Function_.

1. Enter a name for the decoder (below we've used _Dragino LGT92 Decoder_), select the 
   type of Function, _Decoder_ in this case, and finally select _Custom Script_
   from the drop down.
2. Copy and paste the complete decoder function provided by the manufacturer
   found
   [here](https://www.dragino.com/downloads/downloads/LGT_92/Decoder/LGT92-v1.5.0_decoder_20191129.txt) or below.

   ```javascript
   function Decoder(bytes, port) {
    return {
      // GPS coordinates; signed 32 bits integer, MSB; unit: Â°
      // When power is low (<2.84v), GPS wonâ€™t be able to get location
      // info and GPS feature will be disabled and the location field
      // will be filled with 0x0FFFFFFF, 0x0FFFFFFF. 
    
      Latitude: 
        (bytes[0]<<24 | bytes[1]<<16 | bytes[2]<<8 | bytes[3]) / 1000000,
      
      Longitude:
        (bytes[4]<<24 | bytes[5]<<16 | bytes[6]<<8 | bytes[7]) / 1000000,

      // Alarm status: boolean
      ALARM_status: (bytes[8] & 0x40) > 0,

      // Battery; 14 bits; unit: V
      BatV: ((bytes[8] & 0x3f)<<8 | bytes[9]) / 1000,

      // Motion detection mode; 2 bits
      MD: {
        "0": "Disable",
        "1": "Move",
        "2": "Collide",
        "3": "Custom"
      }[bytes[10]>>6],

      // LED status for position, uplink and downlink; 1 bit
      LON: (bytes[10] & 0x20) ? "ON" : "OFF",

      // Firmware version; 5 bits 
      FW:150+(bytes[10] & 0x1f),

      // Roll; signed 16 bits integer, MSB; unit: Â°

      // Sign-extend to 32 bits to support negative values: shift 16 bytes

      // too far to the left, followed by sign-propagating right shift

      Roll: (bytes[11]<<24>>16 | bytes[12]) / 100,

      // Pitch: signed 16 bits integer, MSB, unit: Â°

      Pitch: (bytes[13]<<24>>16 | bytes[14]) / 100,
    };
  }
  ```  
  
   Next we need to add two more fields that are required by the Mappers API but
   missing from the function. You'll see these at the bottom of the editor
   window in the screen shot below. Altitude is permanently set to zero because
   this device does not output altitude and we will assume that the tracker will
   be used at ground level. Accuracy is set to three meters since this device
   does not output a measure of accuracy and this is a reasonable measure of
   precision to be expected for this device. Find more details on the API
   specification [here](./mappers-api).
3. Next search for and add the _Mappers Integration_ label we created with the
   integration.
4. Finally save your function.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-create-decoder.png"
  )}
/>

### 4. Attach Label to Device

Next we'll attach the _Mappers Integration_ label to the device. Navigate to
your device page and click the Add Label button shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-device-page.png"
  )}
/>

Search for the _Mappers Integration_ label and click _Add Label_ as shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-attach-label.png"
  )}
/>

You are now ready to power on your device and verify that data is being sent
correctly to the Mapper API. To do this just expand an uplink event in the event
log and verify that you are getting a _"Success"_ message for the integration as
shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart-device-event.png"
  )}
/>

That's all! You can now expect to see your data show up on
[mappers.helium.com](https://mappers.helium.com) in eight hours or less. The map
data is updated every six hours starting at 04:20 UTC.
