# Mappers Roadmap

## Introduction
The Mappers project is a crowd-sourced effort to build a true-signal coverage map of the Helium network across the globe.
The ‘Moonshot’ goal for this roadmap is to get the Helium coverage map to a state where it offers a full understanding of the ubiquitious LoRaWAN network. 
In pursuit of this goal, there are several high-level objectives that are broken out into their tactical subparts.

## Make It Easier to Contribute
### Mapping Device Tutorials
* Document existing mapping devices
* Write in-depth guides for each mapping device in Helium docs
### Develop BLE Mapper
* Next generation of mapper device allows reporting of uncovered areas via native app pair.
* Open source project and protocol designed to interface with Mapping App
* Any party can manufacture and sell their own.
* DIY mappers still supported.
### Native Mapping App
* Streamline onboarding for users. No console account or firmware needed.
* Works in tandem with BLE mappers
* Offers extended functionality beyond current platforms.

## Better Understand Mappers Data
### Continued Mappers v2 Improvements
Mappers v2 was structured to be the 'Minimum Lovable Release' of the longterm vision, a Helium Coverage Explorer. In pursuit of the next major release, we have used v2 to teach us the value of the data, how it is used, and how community members most enjoy contributing. The v2 platform has already done a lot to help us in this respect. In the effort of continuing our user research, we will continue to add additional features and enhancements. These additions will continue to be tracked as issues on the [Mappers Github](https://github.com/helium/mappers/issues) project. 
### Mappers v3 (Coverage Explorer)
* Shaped by learnings from v2 release
* Tools designed to allow users to better understand hotspot deployments

## Further Engage Mappers
Should mapper growth be lower than desired, there are opportunities to expand.
* Leaderboard
* Capture the Hex game

## Enable Community Participation
### Mappers API
* Broader opportunities for community-built apps.
### Open Source
* All source of this project will continue to be freely available
