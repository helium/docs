## Arduino Portenta H7 with the LoRa Vision Shield

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Introduction to Guide

:::important

Before we begin, please make sure you've followed the steps from the Console
quickstart [here](/use-the-network/console/quickstart).

:::

## Objective and Requirements

In this version 0.0.1 guide, you will learn:

- How to setup your environment
- How to program a basic application that will send packets over the Helium
  Network
- Verify real-time packets sent to the Helium Console via Hotspot that's in
  range
- Setup a full [Adafruit.io](https://io.adafruit.com/) http connection with a base64 decoder. (Note: CayenneLPP with Adafruit.io is easier to setup but less flexible)


For this example, you will need the following:

### Hardware

- [Portenta H7](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7)
- [LoRa Vision Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-portenta-vision-shield-lora%C2%AE)
- Micro USB Type B Cable -
  [Example](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0719H12WD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?)
- U.FL connector for your region. this example will use the US915MHz Antenna 
  [Example: U.FL IPEX to SMA Connector Antenna 915MHz for Lora Board](https://www.amazon.com/DIYmall-Connector-Antenna-915MHz-Lora32u4/dp/B084KVYBH5)
  
### Software

- [Arduino software \(IDE\)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) Old stable version ~Arduino IDE 1.8.19 or new version ~2.0.0RC3  
- [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)

## Hardware Setup

This step will cover adding an antenna to the LoRa Vision Shield.

### Adding the Antenna

The uFL connector is just a push fit on the LoRa board, not the main Portenta board (That uFL connector is for WiFi and BLE). 
Try not to have to remove and replace the antenna very often. the uFL connectors are rated for 30 connection cycles, so be careful when connecting/disconnecting to not rip the pads off the PCB


## Software Setup

### Getting the Arduino IDE

Download and install the latest version of
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your preferred OS.

- [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)

    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/mkrwan.png"
  )}
/>

If you prefer to install the zipped latest file from the github click [MKRWAN](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MKRWAN) download the zipped file then find the library menu item to install zipped libraries





### Arduino Library #2 portenta-pro-community-solutions

To communicate with Helium's LoRaWAN network, we'll need to install an Arduino
library.

To install, open your Arduino IDE:

1. Navigate to Library Manager \(**Sketch &gt; Include Library &gt; Manage
   Libraries**\).
2. In the search box, type **community** into the search, select the **portenta-pro-community-solutions** library latest
   version see image below, and click Install.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/portenta-pro-community-solutions-library-install.png"
  )}
/>

If you prefer to install the zipped latest file from the github click [portenta-pro-community-solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions) download the zipped file then find the library menu item to install zipped libraries


### MKRWAN reprogram LoRa board using the MKRWAN example sketch
MKRWANFWUpdate_standalone make sure you run the serial monitor to fully update the LoRa module with the correct program.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/mkrwanFWUpdate_standalone-image.png"
  )}
/>


### Upload Sketch

We're finally ready to upload our sketch to the board. In the Arduino IDE, click
the right arrow button, or navigate to \(**Sketch &gt; Upload\),** to build and
upload your new firmware to the board. You should see something similar to the
image below at the bottom of your Arduino IDE, when the upload is successful.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/upload-success.png"
  )}
/>

### Viewing Serial Output

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining
the network. Let's use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output
from the board. We first need to select the serial port again, but this time it
will be a **different port** than the one we selected to communicate with the
bootloader. Once again, navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: Arduino Portenta**\), but make sure the serial device, either COM\# or ttyACM\#, is different!
Next navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Serial Monitor**\), you should begin to see
output similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/mkrwanFWUpdate_standalone-image.png"
  )}
/>


### Programming Example Sketch

Now that we have the required Arduino board support and library installed, lets
program the board with the provided example sketch.

To create a new Arduino sketch, open your Arduino IDE, \(**File &gt; New\).**
Next, replace the template sketch with the sketch found
[here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions/blob/main/examples/dot3-portenta-vision-shields/dot33-lorawan-specific/dot334-proof-us915-helium-connect.ino),
copy and paste the entirety of it or if you have the Portenta-pro-community-solutions library just find example dot334-proof-us915-helium-connect.ino

Next we'll need to fill in the SECRET_APP_EUI\(lsb\), and SECRET_APP_KEY\(msb\), written exactly as you see them from the [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)
Note: On these boards the deviceEUI is fixed per board, so you will have to run the code once, view in the serial monitor what your boards deviceEUI is and enter that in the Helium Console. (the Helium console will randomly give you a deviceEUI (the top one in the list) but you must reset it)


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-console-keys.png"
  )}
/>


### Selecting Board

Next, we need to select the correct board to build for in the Arduino IDE.
Navigate to \(**Select Tools &gt; Board: &gt; Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Boards &gt; Arduino Portenta H7 \(M7 Core\) \).**


### Enter Bootloader Mode

Next, we need to place the board into bootloader mode, which allows us to update
it with new firmware. To do this, first plug the device into your computer, make
sure the board is getting power \(you should see a green LED on\). Next,
quickly double click the reset push button on the top side of the board, you
should see the green LED slowly blink about one blink per second. If you see this then you have successfully
entered bootloader mode.

### Selecting Port

We're almost ready to upload our sketch, the very last step is to select the
correct Serial port in the Arduino IDE. Navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port:
Arduino Portenta**\). You will also see either **COM\# or /dev/ttyACM\#**
depending on whether you are on Windows, Mac, or Linux. If you do not see a
port, you will need to check if the Arduino drivers have been installed.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/fixed-dev-eui.png"
  )}
/>


Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and look at
our device page, Scroll down to the chart and click the black debug icon to see incoming data, you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-debug.png"
  )}
/>

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next
step is to learn how to use your device data to build applications, visit our
Integrations docs [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).


### Connect to [Adafruit.io](https://io.adafruit.com/)

There are a multitude of IOT sites to choose from, each with it's own methods to setup. 
You will be much more confident about those other sites once you have setup a complete HTTPS connection with a decoder. 
(I will show you the very inefficient base64 decoder simply because LoRaWan naturally base 64 encodes your information)
Note: Using [Adafruit.io](https://io.adafruit.com/) MQTT with CayenneLPP is the fastest and easiest connection, use the prebuilt Adafruit-MQTT from the Helium Inetegrations page and CayenneLPP code for the Arduino, connect the CayenneLPP function and you are active, very powerful but with little naming flexibility.


### Setup Adafruit.io Feed and Webhook

Get a free [Adafruit.io login](https://accounts.adafruit.com/users/sign_up) which allows 5 free feeds (A feed is the data sent from a device to Adafruit). Click IO then feeds then add a new feed I call it "led1" but you can call it whatever you like. 

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/adafruit-feed.png"
  )}
/>

Next create a base (not a fancy) webhook (menu on the right of your feeds, might have to scroll down) and copy the entire webhook URL. 

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/adafruit-webhook.png"
  )}
/>

Webhooks are nice since you can define a duration and they can be used on the web without giving out your main Adafuit KEY, like you would have to if using MQTT.


### Setup Helium Console Integration for Adafruit http

Back at the Helium Console Integrations, make a new integration, give it some sensible name like "adafruit-http-integration" and choose the manual http integration.


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-adafruit-integration-choice.png"
  )}
/>


You will be entering: 1. a name for the integration, 2. The adafruit Webhook copied earlier 3. Some JSON code to get data from the decoder. This is at the bottom of the page and strangely replaces the code above it. 

```
 { "value": {{decoded.payload.value}} }
 
```

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-adafruit-integration-json.png"
  )}
/>


### Setup Helium Console Function Decoder

At the Helium Console Functions area. Make a new function give it a sensible name like "Adafruit-http-decoder-function". Then copy this code to replace the barebones decoder 

```

 function Decoder(bytes, port, uplink_info) {
  var decoded={};
  try{
  var result = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bytes);
  decoded.value = result;
  return decoded;
  } catch (err) {
  return 'Decoder: ' + err.name + " : " + err.message;;
  }
 }
 
```


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-adafruit-integration-json.png"
  )}
/>



### Setup Helium FLOWS to connect the nodes

At the Helium Console go to the flows menu. On some browsers the flows controller is hard to see. Click the "+" and choose and drag onto the screen the Device, Function and Integration you just made. Close the Flows control by re-clicking the hard to see "+"

Connect the 3 icons: from Device to function decoder to adafruit-integration


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-adafruit-flows.png"
  )}
/>



*** View your blue-dot working device


Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and look at
our device page, Scroll down to the chart and click the black debug icon to see incoming data, you should see something similar to the screenshot below. This time the red-dot should be a blue dot showing a successful Helium Adafruit integration.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/helium-debug-blue.png"
  )}
/>


*** View your Adafruit.io Data

Now go back to Adafruit.io and view your feeds to see if the data is coming in like you are expecting.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/adafruit-feed-success.png"
  )}
/>


*** Make an Adafruit.io dashboard

Not as important but fun to go to Adafruit dashboard and click the setup icon top right and create buckets to view your data in streams and graphs etc. Dashboards and feed can be made public if you want to share them with others who have the shareable link.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/arduino/portenta/adafruit-dashboard.png"
  )}
