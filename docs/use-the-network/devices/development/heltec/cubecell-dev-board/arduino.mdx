### Manual updates to the Heltec runtime libraries

Some versions of Heltec's runtime libraries have set default configuration
variables to values that are incompatible with the Helium network, especially
when the Heltec device is configured targeting the North American market.

The following discusses two Heltec runtime files that must be inspected to
ensure compatiblity. The exact location of these files will depend on which
operating system you are using, Windows, Linux, or Mac as well as where the
Arduino IDE is installed.

The typical top level locations of the runtime libraries is shown below for each
operating system. From there the following discussions will present to you the
file locations within these top level directories/folders. Please note the
Heltec library version numbers are expected to change as time goes on.

XXXXX denotes your specfic user id.

##### Arduino IDE library location

- Windows

```text
C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\CubeCell\hardware\CubeCell\1.0.0
```

- Linux

```text
/home/XXXXX/.arduino15/packages/CubeCell/hardware/CubeCell/1.0.0
```

- Mac

```text
/Users/XXXXX/Library/Arduino15/packages/CubeCell/hardware/CubeCell/1.0.0
```

#### Verify LoRaWAN Data Rate

Within an editor of your choice open the file path formed by prepending the
above described platform specific top level directory structure to the following
file:

```text
libraries/LoRa/src/LoRaWan_APP.cpp    (Linux/Mac)
libraries\LoRa\src\LoRaWan_APP.cpp     (Windows)
```

Within this file look for

```
#define defaultDrForNoAdr
```

Depending on the version of the Heltec runtime that is installed this default
may be set to DR_0, DR_3, DR_5 or some other value. Note: DR_5 is not valid for
US915, the North American market.

The defaultDrForNoAdr setting is tied directly to the maximum size of the data
packet you are transferring.

NOTE: If you try to transfer a packet that is larger than this setting allows,
your device may successfully join the network but the data transmit will fail
silently.

| Data Rate \(DR\) | Max Application Payload |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- |
| DR_0             | 11 bytes                |
| DR_1             | 53 bytes                |
| DR_2             | 125 bytes               |
| DR_3             | 242 bytes               |
| DR_4             | 242 bytes               |
| DR_5 - 7         | Not Valid               |

Update the defaultDrForNoAdr as appropriate for your application needs.

The above values are valid for the US902-928MHz region\(North America\), the
values may differ for other LoRa regions, which you can find
[here](https://lora-alliance.org/resource-hub/rp2-101-lorawanr-regional-parameters).

#### Dynamic Data Rate Change

If your application needs to change the current uplink data rate dynamically and
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is not enabled, one can call the

```
LoRaWAN.setDataRateForNoADR(int8_t dataRate)
```

API within your sketch. If you do call this API it must be called after the
LoRaWAN.init() within your sketch for the change to be effective.

#### LoRaWAN preamble size

There are some versions of the Heltec runtime libraries that may set a LoRaWAN
preamble size that is incompatible with the current LoRaWan specification. If
the preamble size is not set correctly your device cannot join the network.

This should be verified in the region specific file corresponding to the region
your device is targeting. Be sure to prepend the above described platform
specific top level directory structure.

The following is the file that must be checked if targeting region US915. Within
an editor of your choice open the file path formed by prepending the above
described platform specific top level directory structure to the following file:

```text
cores/asr650x/loramac/mac/region/RegionUS915.c     (Linux/Mac)
cores\asr650x\loramac\mac\region\RegionUS915.c     (Windows)
```

Within this file locate the line below, the 7th parameter which might be 14
should be changed to either 8 or 16. Either value will work. Earlier versions of
the runtime may have this value set to 14 which is "not" correct.

Change:

```text
Radio.SetTxConfig( MODsEM_LORA, phyTxPower, 0, bandwidth, phyDr, 1, 14, false, true, 0, 0, false, 3e3 );
```

To:

```text
Radio.SetTxConfig( MODEM_LORA, phyTxPower, 0, bandwidth, phyDr, 1, 8, false, true, 0, 0, false, 3e3 );
```

Heltec support has been notified of these issues, hopefully a future release of
those libs will resolve the issues.

### Install Serial Driver

Find Directions on Heltec's website
[here](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/establish_serial_connection.html).

### Set Project Configuration Options

The following options are set via the Arduino IDE Tools menu:

#### Select Board

If you are using the HTCC-AB02 flavor of Heltec board

- Select Tools -&gt; Board: -&gt;CubeCell-Board \(HTCC-AB02\)

If you are using the HTCC-AB02S GPS enabled flavor of Heltec board

- Select Tools -&gt; Board: -&gt;CubeCell-GPS \(HTCC-AB02S\)

#### Select LoraWAN Configuration Options

Arduino IDE: Until you are familiar with their configuration behavior it is
recommended you set the board options as follows:

- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_REGION: -&gt; REGION_US915
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_CLASS: -&gt; CLASS_A
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_NETMODE: -&gt; OTTA
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_ADR: -&gt; OFF
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_UPLINKMODE: -&gt; UNCONFIRMED
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_Net_Reservation: -&gt; OFF
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_AT_SUPPORT: -&gt; OFF
- Select Tools -&gt; LORAWAN_AT_RGB : -&gt; ACTIVE
- Select Tools -&gt; LoRaWan\_ Debug Level : -&gt; FREQ&&DIO \(for most verbose
  messages\)

### Programming **Example Sketch**

Now that we have the required Arduino board support and library installed, lets
program the board with the provided example sketch.

To create a new Arduino sketch, open your Arduino IDE, \(**File &gt; New\).**
Next, replace the template sketch with the sketch found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/longfi-us915/longfi-us915.ino),
copy and paste the entirety of it.

Next we'll need to fill in the AppEUI\(msb\), DevEUI\(msb\), and AppKey\(msb\),
in the sketch, which you can find on the device details page on Console. Be sure
to use the formatting buttons to match the endianess and formatting required for
the sketch, shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-console-details.png"
  )}
/>
)

At the top of the sketch, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with the
matching field from Console, example shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-console-keys.png"
  )}
/>

### Upload Sketch

We're finally ready to upload our sketch to the board. In the Arduino IDE, click
the right arrow button, or navigate to \(**Sketch &gt; Upload\),** to build and
upload your new firmware to the board. You should see something similar to the
image below at the bottom of your Arduino IDE, when the upload is successful.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-arduino-upload.png"
  )}
/>
)

### Using HTCC-AB02S Board With GPS Capable Sketch <a id="HTCC-AB02S-with-GPS"></a>

If you are using the HTCC-AB02S board with a sketch that is GPS enabled but find
the device is unable to obtain a GPS lock you can try changing the GPS data
satellite source via the GPS class Air530.setMode\(\) API. Add the
Air530.setmode\(\) to the setup\(\) method of your sketch.

```text
// MODE_GPS - US,
// MODE_GPS_BEIDOU - Chinese - This is the default
// MODE_GPS_GLONASS - Russian
// set what works best for your connectivity, for example:
Air530.setmode(MODE_GPS);
```

### Patching ADR Functionality

The CubeCell may have issues joining the network with ADR OFF. If you're using
ADR ON, you may also encounter an issue where your CubeCell stops successfully
sending packets after a few minutes. This is caused by the CubeCell firmware's
ADR behavior, and may happen if your payload is above the DR0 maximum size \(11
bytes\).

To patch the CubeCell firmware, find and open the `RegionUS915.c` file in the
firmware directory. On macOS, an example path would be
`~/Library/Arduino15/packages/CubeCell/hardware/CubeCell/1.0.0/cores/asr650x/loramac/mac/region/RegionUS915.c`.

Find the following lines in the file and comment them out:

```text
// Decrease the datarate
getPhy.Attribute = PHY_NEXT_LOWER_TX_DR;
getPhy.Datarate = datarate;
getPhy.UplinkDwellTime = adrNext->UplinkDwellTime;
phyParam = RegionUS915GetPhyParam(&getPhy);
datarate = phyParam.Value;
```

This will prevent the CubeCell from reducing the Data Rate over time and allow
you to send larger packets on a repeated, prolonged basis.

### Viewing Serial Output <a id="viewing-serial-output"></a>

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining
the network. Let's use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output
from the board. We first need to select the serial port again, but this time it
will be a **different port** than the one we selected to communicate with the
bootloader. Once again, navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: COM\#/ttyACM\#**\), but
make sure the serial device, either COM\# or ttyACM\#, is different! Next
navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Serial Monitor**\), you should begin to see output
similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-arduino-serial.png"
  )}
/>
)

Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) and look at
our device page, you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/arduino/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01-console-event-graph.png"
  )}
/>

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next
step is to learn how to use your device data to build applications, visit our
Integrations docs [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).
