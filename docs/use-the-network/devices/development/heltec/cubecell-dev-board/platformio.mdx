## Getting Started With Helium, PlatformIO and Heltec CubeCell

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The Heltec CubeCell HTCC AB0x are one of Heltec's line of popular ASR605x(ARM®
Cortex® M0+ Core) based LoRa development boards with built in USB and battery
charging.

## Introduction

:::important

Before we begin, please make sure you've followed the steps from this guide,
which goes over some initial setup steps.

:::

This guide will walk through installing PlatformIO and deploying a Helium
Arduino program on a target device.

[PlatformIO ](https://platformio.org/)is a cross-platform, cross-architecture,
multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for
software developers who write applications for embedded products.

Here, we will detail the steps required to integrate a specific board type, one
of the [Heltec CubeCell AB0x](https://heltec.org/proudct_center/lora/cubecell/)
family of boards.

However, this guide can be also used to on-board many other types of target
devices. In most cases one can just substitute your target device in place of
the CubeCell developer board.

## Objective and Requirements

In this guide, you will learn:

- How to setup your PlatformIO IDE environment
- How to create, build, upload a simple embedded application
- How to program a basic application that will send packets over the Helium
  Network
- Verify real-time packets sent to the Helium Console via Hotspot that's in
  range

For this example, you will need one of the following Heltec development boards.
The Helium community has experience with the AB01, AB02x and CubeCell Capsule
line boards. Subsequent follow on products may work but have not been tested

### Hardware

- [Heltec CubeCell Development Boards (AB01, AB02x, Capsule)](https://heltec.org/proudct_center/lora/cubecell/)
- Micro USB Type B Cable -
  [Example](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0719H12WD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?)

### Software

PlatformIO is not a standalone IDE, it installs as an extension to Microsoft
VSCode. The Helium Console is a cloud based device management tool that we will
use to enable our device access to the Helium network. There is no installation
required however one will need to create a user account with the Helium Console.

- [VSCode \(IDE)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [PlatformIO \(VScode Extension)](https://platformio.org/)
- [Helium Console](https://www.helium.com/console)

## Hardware Setup <a id="hardware-setup"></a>

#### Attaching the LoRa Antenna <a id="adding-the-antenna"></a>

Your board should have come with a U.FL antenna. All you have to do is attach it
to the U.FL port on the developer board. The method of attachment varies
depending on the target board.

In the case of our example Heltec CubeCell board, some versions of the board may
have more than one U.FL port, if this is the case generally the LoRa antenna
attaches to the port that is on the same side of the board as contains the USB
port connector. In all cases it is best to verify the proper connector with the
board manufacturer.

#### Connect Target Board to Development PC<a id="connect-board"></a>

The target boards are typically connected to the host computer via a USB 2.0
A-Male to Micro B cable. Again this may vary depending upon your target board.

#### Install Develop Machine Serial Driver

Some operating systems, especially Windows, will require the installation of
hardware specific USB device driver code. Most hardware developer board vendors
will supply directions on how this can be accomplished.

For our example installation directions can be found on Heltec's documentation
website
[here](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/establish_serial_connection.html).

## Software Setup <a id="software-setup"></a>

Setting up the VSCode/PlatformIO IDE environment while not complex, does require
several steps that are independent of your target device. We will walk through
these initial setup steps before trying to integrate Helium network access code
into the mix.

### Installing PlatformIO

Using the VSCode instructions found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
download and install Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. PlatformIO IDE is built on
top of VSCode as an extension. Once the VSCode is installed:

1. Open VSCode Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions icon on the left
   side of the main view.
2. Within the Extensions Marketplace search for official PlatformIO IDE
   extension
3. Install PlatformIO IDE.
   \([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)\)

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-platformio-exten.png"
  )}
/>

It is highly recommended to give the quick-start guide a read. It will help you
navigate the unfamiliar interface.
[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html\#quick-start](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#quick-start)

In this tutorial, as an example, we will be using the
[Heltec CubeCell AB0x](https://heltec.org/proudct_center/lora/cubecell/). One
can substitute your target device as needed as you progress through these steps.

Once PlatformIO is installed, you should be welcomed to VSCode with the
following "PIO Home" screen:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-platformio-welcome.png"
  )}
/>

If not already open, the PlatformIO "Home" view can be opened by clicking on the
house icon within the VScode status bar.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-home-button.png"
  )}
/>

### Creating a New PlatformIO Project

If you have not have not already used PlatformIO to build, upload and verify the
operation of a sample application it is best familiarize yourself with the basic
use of PlatformIO before adding the complexity of Helium network access code to
the mix.

If you are familiar and confident with the steps required you can continue at
"Sample Helium Network Access Code" by clicking
[here](#ADD-HELIUM-NETWORK-CODE).

The following steps will walk you through what is required to:

- create a template project
- inspect the default source file, main.cpp as well as the primary project
  configuration file, platformio.ini
- build the project and inspect the build log output
- upload the sample binary to the target development board.
- inspect serial output debug information.

Before proceeding with actual code that will connect to the Helium network,
create a sample, template project.

#### Open "New Project Wizard" - Select project name and board

- Within the "PIO Home" view click on "New Project".

- At the "Project Wizard" dialog enter a name for your project in the "Name"
  field.
- Within the "Board" field select the appropriate target board by entering the
  name of the manufacturer, "Heltec" for our example. The PlatformIO auto search
  feature should present you with a known list of supported boards. In our case
  we enter "Heltec" and choose the "Heltec CubceCell-GPS (HTCC-AB02S)" from the
  supplied list.

Note: If your target device is different start to enter the device manufacturer
in the "Board" field, PlatformIO will attempt to fill in the entry with those
devices that it is aware of. Hopefully your device will be presented in the
list. If so, select it.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-wizard-board.png"
  )}
/>

#### Select framework and project location

- Select the desired runtime framework from the "Framework" drop down. Target
  devices may support one, and possibly more than one, runtime framework. Choose
  what is appropriate for your target. At present only "Arduino" is supported
  for the board we have selected for our example.
- For location, if the checkbox is selected the project will be created within
  the default PlatformIO workspace, which is sufficient for our purposes.
- Click the "Finish" button to create the project. ( You may need to scroll down
  the wizard window to expose the Finish button)

Note: The time taken to create a project will vary depending on whether or not
the selected platform and framework files have been previously downloaded. When
the project has been created it should be shown within the PlatformIO Explorer
view typically found on the left side of the IDE.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-wizard-complete.png"
  )}
/>

Typical project explorer view.

#### Default project main.cpp

If you are familiar developing within the Arduino IDE, main.cpp is much the same
as the Arduino \*.ino. It also contains default setup() and loop() functions.

PlatformIO also adds a required "\#include <Arduino.h\>" statement. This is an
important/necessary difference between PlatformIO and Arduino IDEs.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-main-cpp.png"
  )}
/>

#### platformio.ini - project configurations

Let's take a look at the platformio.ini file in the root of our new project.
This is where one defines project configuration definitions. In the Arduino
world one would do this via the IDE tool bar selections.

Note: when this file is modified the entire project will be rebuilt when the
project is next built or uploaded.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-platform-ini.png"
  )}
/>

Here we see the platformio.ini file that was created as a result of the running
the New Project wizard targeting our CubeCell board.

#### Build the target device application

Now that the template project has been created it's time to build the device
application. Within PlatformIO the "Build" button is the check-mark found within
the bottom status bar. Clicking on this button should start the build process.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-build-button.png"
  )}
/>

#### Inspect the build output

Due to the defines within platformio.ini, PlatformIO is able to determine the
project board and framework dependencies. Any missing dependencies are
automatically installed at build time, thus this process may be seen in the
build output. This feature allows us to add libraries into our platformio.ini
file, which will then be downloaded for us, if needed, at build time.

The build process results can be found within the "Terminal View" typically
found at the bottom of the VSCode window. Much like with Arduino, the build
output will dump the calculated amount of Ram and Flash memory used by your
application.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-build-output_1.png"
  )}
/>

Start of the build output displaying configuration information.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-build-output_2.png"
  )}
/>

Tail end of build log showing Ram and Flash usage. There is also a Problems
output view that may help when trying to resolve build issues.

#### List of attached devices

If, within the "PIO Home" view, you select the "Devices" icon on the left, you
will see listed any attached physical devices as well as their associated comm
ports:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-devices.png"
  )}
/>

The list should reflect your target device.

#### Uploading binary to target device

Now that the code has built successfully, if a target device is attached to your
computer the resulting binary can be uploaded to the target device.

The method of uploading the binary to your device may vary depending on the
target device. PlatformIO will attempt to configure upload options appropriate
for the chosen board. If the default configuration does not work in your
instance detailed information can be found within the PlatformIO documentation
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env_upload.html?highlight=upload)
or within your target board vendors documentation set.

We will attempt to include such information along with any sample project code
we provided if the procedure is different from that described here.

```
For instance our target, the CubeCell has a peculiar
requirement:
Prior to attempting to upload your binary make sure
any terminal session that might be attached to the
debug comm port has been deleted. Occasionally but not
always, PlatformIO will automatically close the comm
port. If it does not upload errors will occur.
```

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-upload-button.png"
  )}
/>

Click on the Upload button within the bottom Status bar.

Below you will see a typical output as the binary is uploaded to the target
board.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-upload.png"
  )}
/>

If you have made it this far then we know your environment can build and upload
a device application. Now it's time to connect to the Helium network.

### Helium Console - Create Device

In order for a target device to communicate via the Helium Network a user
account must first be created. Once the user account is created then a console
device must be created.

When creating the console device, make note of the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey
device credentials. These are used to connect to the network and will need to be
inserted into the device application code below. A console quick start guide can
be found [here](/use-the-network/console/quickstart).

### Sample Helium Network Access Code <a name="ADD-HELIUM-NETWORK-CODE"></a>

If you have not created a simple template project and you want to a try one of
the samples you can copy a sample into your workspace where it should build
without error. A full PlatformIO project can be found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-basic).
Alternatively you can update the template project created above by continuing
the following steps.

#### Update main.cpp

Now that we have the required board and library runtime support installed, let's
program the board with an example Helium network enabled application.

To update the sample application created above:

- open, within PlatformIO, your projects src/main.ccp file
- replace this template main.cpp with the content of the sample application
  found
  [here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-basic/src/main.cpp).
  Copy and paste the entirety of it.

#### Add device credentials

Next we'll need replace the placeholder AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey values found
within the sample program with the real values found on the target device page
within the Helium Console.

```
Note:
 The endianess required for these credentials varys
 depending on the LoRaWAN runtime library implementation.
 Using a custom library implementation will require an
 understanding of that libraries endian requirement, big
 endian or little endian.
```

For our CubeCell example all values are big endian \(msb\), most significant bit
on the left.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-console-details.png"
  )}
/>

At the top of the main.cpp file, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with
the matching field from the Helium Console, example shown below. Your numbers
will be different depending on what the console creates when you add your target
device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-console-keys.png"
  )}
/>

#### Verify LoRaWAN channels mask

Runtime library implementations are designed to work across several LoRaWAN
regions and networks. The firmware will attempt to join the network using
various frequency sub-bands, defined by a channel mask, until the join succeeds.
It is recommended that you change the default channel mask to a value that will
help the join process complete connection to the Helium network in a more timely
manner. The process, where and how, to update this channel mask will vary
depending on the LoRaWAN runtime implementation

For our example using the Heltec CubeCell and it's runtime the following piece
of code has been incorporated into the sample projects. Refer to a sample to
determine where this code should reside, generally near the above mentioned
credentials is fine.

```
/*LoraWan channelsmask, default channels 0-7*/
uint16_t userChannelsMask[6]={ 0xFF00,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000,0x0000 };
```

#### platformio.ini - project configurations

For our sample application we need a few configuration items added to the
project platformio.ini file. One set is the project defaults, the next is serial
debug monitor configurations and then LoRaWAN configurations.

Complete documentation of platformio.ini content can be found
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/index.html). Serial
debug monitor specific items
[here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env_monitor.html).

Note: The comment character for this file type is the semicolon.

For our example CubeCell project we update the projects platformio.ini with the
content from the sample project:

- open, within PlatformIO, your projects platformio.ini file
- replace this template file with the content found
  [here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/blob/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-basic/platformio.ini).
  Copy and paste the entirety of it.

Once you have become more familiar with the LoRaWAN/Helium network feel free to
experiment with different configuration settings possible within platformio.ini.

#### Build the device application

After updating the main.cpp and platformio.ini files it's time to build the
device application. Within PlatformIO the "Build" button is the check-mark found
within the bottom status bar. Clicking on this button should start the build
process.

#### Inspect the build results

The build output results can be found within the "Terminal View" typically found
at the bottom of the VSCode window. Verify the build completed successfully.

#### Possible Arduino to PlatformIO porting issues

When porting Arduino sketches to PlatformIO you may find errors such as
undefined functions. These may be functions that are called by setup() or loop()
or other custom functions prior to them being defined. This is a side effect of
the different C version of C compilers used with PlatformIO vs Arduino. In this
instance we just need to define the function prototype before the function is
actually called. Another compatibility issue is that unlike Arduino IDE, you
must include Arduino.h at the start of your C file if you are using Arduino
defined constructs. Generally the compatibility issues are minor.

#### Verify Heltec runtime configurations.

Running the previous build operation will ensure the Heltec runtime dependencies
have been downloaded. At the time of this writing some versions of Heltec's
runtime libraries have set default configuration variables to values that are
incompatible with the Helium network, especially when the Heltec device is
configured targeting the North American market. Please follow this
[link](#HTCC-MANUAL-RUNTIME-UPDATES) within this document and verify the file
content. Return here after verification.

If changes needed to be made it is best to run a "Clean" build process by
clicking on the Trash Can button on the status bar followed by a "Build" to
ensure the changes have been picked up properly.

#### Upload Binary to target device

If the build process completed successfully, upload the binary to the target
device via the "Upload" (right pointing arrow) button found on the status bar

NOTE: Prior to attempting to upload your binary make sure any terminal session
that might be attached to the debug comm port has been deleted. Occasionally but
not always, PlatformIO will automatically close the comm port, if it does not
upload errors will occur.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-upload.png"
  )}
/>

Successful upload example, your results will vary.

#### Viewing Target Device Serial Output <a id="viewing-serial-output"></a>

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining
the network. The PlatformIO Serial Monitor can be used to view the serial debug
output from the board. You will recall that we set the serial port
configurations within the platformio.ini file for our project.

To open the serial monitor click on the "Serial Monitor" button within the
status bar.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-serial-monitor.png"
  )}
/>

You should begin to see output similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-serial-debug.png"
  )}
/>

You can use any virtual terminal emulator for this purpose, but recall certain
Heltec boards seem to require the terminal emulator be disconnected from the
target device prior to attempting to upload a new binary.

#### Helium Console Uplinks

Now let's head back to the [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) and
login to your account. Once logged in select the "Devices" item on the left,
then select the target device previously created. Scroll down a bit on the
device page and you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab01/platformio/heltec-cubecell-htcc-ab0x-console-event-graph.png"
  )}
/>

Activation messages are those seen when the device first attempts to join the
network.  
Downlink messages are those delivered from the network to your target device.  
Uplink messages are those messages delivered from your target device to the
Helium network.

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next
step is to learn how to use your device data to build applications, visit our
Integrations docs [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).

### Device Application Code Debugging

Unfortunately at this time CubeCell does not support a debug probe that enjoys
built-in support within PlatformIO. Please visit the Heltec community forum
found [here](http://community.heltec.cn/) for help with external debugger
questions.

### Misc device application hints

Follow this [link](#HTCC-APPLICATION-HINTS) within this guide for useful
application enhancements.

### Manual updates to the Heltec runtime libraries <a name="HTCC-MANUAL-RUNTIME-UPDATES"></a>

Some versions of Heltec's runtime libraries have set default configuration
variables to values that are incompatible with the Helium network, especially
when the Heltec device is configured targeting the North American market. The
following discusses Heltec runtime files that must be inspected to ensure
compatibility. The exact location of these files will depend on which operating
system you are using, Windows, Linux, or Mac. The typical top level location of
the runtime libraries is shown below for each operating system. From there the
following discussions will present to you the file locations within these top
level directories/folders. Please note the Heltec library version numbers are
expected to change as time goes on. XXXXX denotes your specific user id.

#### PlatformIO IDE Heltec runtime library locations:

```text
Windows: C:\Users\XXXX\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoasrmicro650x\

Linux: /home/XXXXX/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoasrmicro650x/

Mac OS: /Users/XXXXX/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoasrmicro650x/
```

#### Verify LoRaWAN Data Rate

Within an editor of your choice open the file path formed by prepending the
above described platform specific top level directory structure to the following
file:

```text
libraries/LoRa/src/LoRaWan_APP.cpp    (Linux/Mac)
libraries\LoRa\src\LoRaWan_APP.cpp     (Windows)
```

Within this file look for

```
#define defaultDrForNoAdr
```

Depending on the version of the Heltec runtime that is installed this default
may be set to DR_0, DR_3, DR_5 or some other value. Note: DR_5 is not valid for
US915, the North American market.

The defaultDrForNoAdr setting is tied directly to the maximum size of the data
packet you are transferring.

NOTE: If you try to transfer a packet that is larger than this setting allows,
your device may successfully join the network but the data transmit will fail
silently.

| Data Rate \(DR\) | Max Application Payload |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- |
| DR_0             | 11 bytes                |
| DR_1             | 53 bytes                |
| DR_2             | 125 bytes               |
| DR_3             | 242 bytes               |
| DR_4             | 242 bytes               |
| DR_5 - 7         | Not Valid               |

Update the defaultDrForNoAdr as appropriate for your application needs.

The above values are valid for the US902-928MHz region\(North America\), the
values may differ for other LoRa regions, which you can find
[here](https://lora-alliance.org/resource-hub/rp2-101-lorawanr-regional-parameters).

#### Dynamic Data Rate Change

If your application needs to change the current uplink data rate dynamically and
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is not enabled, one can call the

```
LoRaWAN.setDataRateForNoADR(int8_t dataRate)
```

API within your sketch. If you do call this API it must be called after the
LoRaWAN.init() within your sketch for the change to be effective.

#### Verify LoRaWAN preamble size

There are some versions of the Heltec runtime libraries that may set a LoRaWAN
preamble size that is incompatible with the current LoRaWan specification. If
the preamble size is not set correctly your device cannot join the network. This
should be verified in the region specific file corresponding to the region your
device is targeting. Be sure to prepend the above described platform/IDE
specific top level directory structure.

The following is the file that must be checked if targeting region US915. Within
an editor of your choice open the file path formed by prepending the above
described IDE/platform specific top level directory structure to the following
file:

```
Linux/Mac OS: cores/asr650x/loramac/mac/region/RegionUS915.c

Windows:      cores\asr650x\loramac\mac\region\RegionUS915.c
```

Within this file locate the line below, the 7th parameter which might be 14
should be changed to either 8 or 16. Either value will work. Earlier versions of
the runtime may have this value set to 14 which is "not" correct. Change:

```text
Radio.SetTxConfig( MODsEM_LORA, phyTxPower, 0, bandwidth, phyDr, 1, 14, false, true, 0, 0, false, 3e3 );
```

To:

```text
Radio.SetTxConfig( MODEM_LORA, phyTxPower, 0, bandwidth, phyDr, 1, 8, false, true, 0, 0, false, 3e3 );
```

Heltec support has been notified of these issues, hopefully a future release of
those libs will resolve the issues.

### Patching ADR Functionality

The CubeCell may have issues joining the network with ADR OFF. If you're using
ADR ON, you may also encounter an issue where your CubeCell stops successfully
sending packets after a few minutes. This is caused by the CubeCell firmware's
ADR behavior, and may happen if your payload is above the DR0 maximum size \(11
bytes\).

To patch the CubeCell firmware, find and open the `RegionUS915.c` in the
following location.

```text
Windows: C:\Users\XXXX\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoasrmicro650x\cores\asr650x\loramac\mac\region\RegionUS915.c

Linux: ~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoasrmicro650x/cores/asr650x/loramac/mac/region/RegionUS915.c

Find the following lines in the file and comment them out:

```text
// Decrease the datarate
getPhy.Attribute = PHY_NEXT_LOWER_TX_DR;
getPhy.Datarate = datarate;
getPhy.UplinkDwellTime = adrNext->UplinkDwellTime;
phyParam = RegionUS915GetPhyParam(&getPhy);
datarate = phyParam.Value;
```

This will prevent the CubeCell from reducing the Data Rate over time and allow
you to send larger packets on a repeated, prolonged basis.

#### Using HTCC-AB02S Board with GPS Capable Sketch <a id="HTCC-AB02S-with-GPS"></a>

If you are using the HTCC-AB02S board with a program that is GPS enabled but
find the device is unable to obtain a GPS lock you can try changing the GPS data
satellite source via the GPS class Air530.setMode\(\) API. Add the
Air530.setmode\(\) to the setup\(\) method of your sketch.

```text
// MODE_GPS - US,
// MODE_GPS_BEIDOU - Chinese - This is the default
// MODE_GPS_GLONASS - Russian
// set what works best for your connectivity, for example:
Air530.setmode(MODE_GPS);
```

A sample GPS enabled project for the CubeCell can be found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-platformio/tree/master/Heltec-CubeCell-Board/examples/cubecell-helium-us915-gps).

#### Dynamically altering Data Rate

A recent change to the Heltec runtime exposes an API interface a device
application can use to alter the current LoRaWAN data rate.

```text
LoRaWAN.setDataRateForNoADR(int8_t dataRate);
```

This should be done sometime after LoRaWAN.init() is called.
