## Objective and Requirements

In this guide, you will learn:

- How to setup your environment
- How to program a basic application that will send packets over the Helium
  Network
- Verify real-time packets sent to the Helium Console via Hotspot that's in
  range

For this example, you will need the following:

### Hardware

- [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V2](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32/)

2. Enter ChipID
3. Save license field, will look like
   `0x########,0x#########,0x########,0x########`

### Programming **Example Sketch**

Now that we have the required Arduino board support and library installed, lets
program the board with the provided example sketch.

To create a new Arduino sketch, open your Arduino IDE, \(**File &gt; New\).**
Next, replace the template sketch with the sketch found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Heltec-WiFi-LoRa-32-V2/longfi-us915/longfi-us915.ino),
copy and paste the entirety of it.

Next we'll need to fill in the AppEUI\(msb\), DevEUI\(msb\), and AppKey\(msb\),
in the sketch, which you can find on the device details page on Console. Be sure
to use the formatting buttons to match the endianess and formatting required for
the sketch, shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2-console-device-details.png"
  )}
/>

At the top of the sketch, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with the
matching field from Console, example shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2-arduino-sketch-keys.png"
  )}
/>
)

### Selecting Port

Next, we need to select the correct Serial port in the Arduino IDE. Navigate to
\(**Tools &gt; Port: COM\#/ttyACM\#**\). You will also see either **COM\# or
/dev/ttyACM\#** depending on whether you are on Windows, Mac, or Linux. If you
do not see a port, please visit the Drivers section in
[Heltec's docs](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/establish_serial_connection.html)
to make sure you have what's needed for your operating system.

### Select LoRaWAN Region

The last step before we upload our sketch is to select the correct LoRaWAN
Region, navigate to **\(Tools &gt; LoRaWAN Region: &gt; REGION_US915\).**

### Select **Uplink Mode**

The last step before we upload our sketch is to select the LoRaWAN Uplink Mode,
navigate to **\(Tools &gt; LoRaWAN Uplink Mode: &gt; UNCONFIRMED\).**

### Required Change to Default DataRate

In this example sketch, ADR is turned off, therefore you must manually set the
desired data rate for your payload size manually. This library uses a default
data rate that is not supported by the Helium Network so you must change it to
one in the following range DR_0 - DR_4. To do this change the default data rate
on line 20 in the file found below for your operating system

`linux: /home/{user}/Arduino/libraries/ESP32_LoRaWAN-master/src/ESP32_LoRaWAN.cpp`

`windows: Documents\Arduino\libraries\ESP32_LoRaWAN-master\src\ESP32_LoRaWAN.cpp`

`mac os: Documents/Arduino/librariesESP32_LoRaWAN-master/src/ESP32_LoRaWAN.cpp`

**Change line 20 to:**

```text
#define LORAWAN_DEFAULT_DATARATE                    DR_3
```

:::info

If you don't want to change data rate manually,
[Helium now supports ADR](/use-the-network/console/adr)

:::

### Upload Sketch

We're finally ready to upload our sketch to the board. In the Arduino IDE, click
the right arrow button, or navigate to \(**Sketch &gt; Upload\),** to build and
upload your new firmware to the board. You should see something similar to the
image below at the bottom of your Arduino IDE, when the upload is successful.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2-arduino-upload-sketch.png"
  )}
/>
)

### Viewing Serial Output <a id="viewing-serial-output"></a>

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining
the network. Let's use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output
from the board. We first need to select the serial port again, but this time it
will be a **different port** than the one we selected to communicate with the
bootloader. Once again, navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: COM\#/ttyACM\#**\), but
make sure the serial device, either COM\# or ttyACM\#, is different! Next
navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Serial Monitor**\), you should begin to see output
similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2-arduino-debug-terminal.png"
  )}
/>
)

Your device may take several minutes to join and begin to send uplink packets
because the library is designed to work in several LoRaWAN regions and networks.
Because of this, the firmware will attempt different sub-bands until it is
successful. If you would like to change the default channel mask in the library
to speed up this process you can make the following change below in the file
specified.

**Change lines 343-348 to:**

```text
channelsMaskTemp[0] = 0xFF00;
channelsMaskTemp[1] = 0x0000;
channelsMaskTemp[2] = 0x0000;
channelsMaskTemp[3] = 0x0000;
channelsMaskTemp[4] = 0x0002;
channelsMaskTemp[5] = 0x0000;
```

Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and look at
our device page, you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v2-console-event-graph.png"
  )}
/>

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next
step is to learn how to use your device data to build applications, visit our
Integrations docs [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).
