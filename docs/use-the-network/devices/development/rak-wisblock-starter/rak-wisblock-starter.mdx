## Introduction
Here you will find one or more sample PlatformIO embedded projects
designed to transmit LoRaWAN packets using a [RAK Wireless WisBlock Starter Kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-starter-kit).
The starter kit is just that, a base developer board that can
have multiple combinations of expansion boards added to it. The full
 WisBlock offering can be seen [here](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock).
