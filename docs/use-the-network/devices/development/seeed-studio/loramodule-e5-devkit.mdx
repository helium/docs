title: LoRa-E5 Development Kit - based on LoRa-E5 STM32WLE5JC
description:
  LoRa-E5 Development Kit consists of a LoRa-E5 Dev Board, an
  antenna(EU868/US915), a USB type C cable, and a 2*AA 3V Battery Holder.
  LoRa-E5 Dev Board embedded with LoRa-E5 STM32WLE5JC Module that supports
  LoRaWAN protocol on global frequency band. It is user-friendly since it leads
  out full GPIOs of LoRa-E5 supporting various data protocols and interfaces
  including RS-485, Grove, male/female headers, etc. It would be a perfect
  choice for fast testing and rapid prototyping of your LoRa IoT projects.
