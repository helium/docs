title: LoRa-E5 mini (STM32WLE5JC) Dev Board
description:
  LoRa-E5 mini is a compacted-sized dev board suitable for the rapid testing and
  building of small-size LoRa device and application prototyping. LoRa-E5 mini
  is embedded with and leads out full GPIOs of LoRa-E5 STM32WLE5JC. It has rich
  interfaces including UART, ADC, SPI, IIC,etc. Supporting LoRaWAN protocol and
  global frequency, LoRa-E5 mini is able to achieve a transmission range of up
  to 10 km in open area and ultra-low power consumption.
