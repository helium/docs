import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Introduction to Guide

:::important

Before we begin, please make sure you've followed the steps from this guide,
which goes over some initial setup steps.

:::

## Objective and Requirements

In this guide, you will learn:

- How to setup your environment
- How to program a basic application that will send packets over the Helium
  Network
- Verify real-time packets sent to the Helium Console via Hotspot that's in
  range

For this example, you will need the following:

### Hardware

- [Sparkfun Pro RF - LoRa](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14916)
- Micro USB Type B Cable -
  [Example](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0719H12WD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?)
- Soldering Iron
- Small gauge wire

### Software

- [Arduino software \(IDE\)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)

## Hardware Setup

This step will cover adding an antenna and closing the LoRaWAN jumpers on this
board.

### Adding the Antenna

You have two options for adding an antenna on this board.

**U.FL Antenna:** Connect any 915Mhz compatible antenna, for instance,
[this ](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Anaren/66089-0906?qs=sGAEpiMZZMuBTKBKvsBmlGlvlFGR4gdSgkIgGKwINqg%3D)small,
low cost antenna, to the U.FL port shown in the image below.

  )}
/>

**Wire Antenna:** Solder a short wire\(78mm in length for Americas\) to the
pin-out as shown below.

    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-antenna-wire.jpg"
  )}
/>

### Closing the LoRaWAN Jumpers

In order to fully communicate with the LoRa radio transceiver on the board,
you'll need to close two jumpers on the underside shown below.

    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-lorawan-jumpers.jpg"
  )}

## Software Setup

### Getting the Arduino IDE

Download and install the latest version of
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your preferred OS.

- [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)
- [Mac OSX](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)

### Arduino Board Support

The Sparkfun Pro RF requires two Arduino board support packages. Follow the
instructions below to install both.

#### SAMD Boards \(32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+\)

To install, open your Arduino IDE:

1. Navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Boards &gt; Boards Manager...\)**
2. Search for **SAMD Boards \(32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+\)**
3. Select the newest version and click Install

   **SparkFun SAMD Boards**

#### SparkFun SAMD Boards

To install, open your Arduino IDE:

1. Navigate to **\(File &gt; Preferences\), \(Arduino &gt; Preferences\) on
   MacOS.**
2. Find the section at the bottom called **Additional Boards Manager URLs:**

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-arduino-add-board.png"
  )}
/>

1. Add this URL in the text box:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/master/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json
```

1. Close the Preferences windows

Next, to install this board support package:

1. Navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Boards &gt; Boards Manager...\)**
2. Search for **SparkFun SAMD Boards**
3. Select the newest version and click Install

### Arduino Library

To communicate with Helium's LoRaWAN network, we'll need to install an Arduino
library.

To install, open your Arduino IDE:

1. Navigate to Library Manager \(**Sketch &gt; Include Library &gt; Manage
   Libraries**\).
2. In the search box, type **IBM LMIC framework** into the search, select the
   version shown below, and click Install.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-arduino-add-library.png"
  )}
/>

#### Update IBM LMIC framework config.h

This library requires that a config file be setup properly. After you have
installed the `IBM LMIC framework` library, navigate to it's directory on your
operating system found below. Next, replace the `config.h` file in this
directory with this
[config.h](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Sparkfun-Pro-RF/longfi-us915/config.h)
file.

```
linux: /home/{user}/Arduino/libraries/IBM\_LMIC\_framework/src/lmic
windows: Documents/Arduino/libraries/IBM\_LMIC\_framework/src/lmic
mac os: Documents/Arduino/libraries/IBM\_LMIC\_framework/src/lmic
```

### Programming **Example Sketch**

Now that we have the required Arduino board support and library installed, lets
program the board with the provided example sketch.

To create a new Arduino sketch, open your Arduino IDE, \(**File &gt; New\).**
Next, replace the template sketch with the sketch found
[here](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/blob/master/Sparkfun-Pro-RF/longfi-us915/longfi-us915.ino),
copy and paste the entirety of it.

Next we'll need to fill in the AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey, in the sketch, which
you can find on the device details page on Console. Be sure to use the
formatting buttons to match the endianess and formatting required for the
sketch, shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-console.png"
  )}
/>

At the top of the sketch, replace the three **FILL_ME_IN** fields, with the
matching field from Console, example shown below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-sketch-keys.png"
  )}
/>

### Selecting Board

Next, we need to select the correct board to build for in the Arduino IDE.
Navigate to \(**Select Tools &gt; Board: &gt; SparkFun SAMD21 Pro RF\).**

### Enter Bootloader Mode

Next, we need to place the board into bootloader mode, which allows us to update
it with new firmware. To do this, first plug the device into your computer, make
sure the power switch is turned on \(you should see a red LED on\). Next,
quickly double click the reset push button on the side of the board, you should
see a blue LED come on now too. If you see this then you have successfully
entered bootloader mode.

### Selecting Port

We're almost ready to upload our sketch, the very last step is to select the
correct Serial port in the Arduino IDE. Navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port:
Sparkfun SAMD21 Pro RF**\). You will also see either **COM\# or /dev/ttyACM\#**
depending on whether you are on Windows, Mac, or Linux. If you do not see a
port, please visit the Drivers section in
[Sparkfun's guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-samd21-pro-rf-hookup-guide?_ga=2.148378999.1172134851.1586114454-289367592.1582349414&_gac=1.242421430.1585837307.EAIaIQobChMI86GEgfjJ6AIVBQF9Ch0mpwyeEAEYASAAEgLFn_D_BwE#hardware-overview)
to make sure you have what's needed for your operating system.

### Upload Sketch

We're finally ready to upload our sketch to the board. In the Arduino IDE, click
the right arrow button, or navigate to \(**Sketch &gt; Upload\),** to build and
upload your new firmware to the board. You should see something similar to the
image below at the bottom of your Arduino IDE, when the upload is successful.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-arduino-upload.png"
  )}
/>

### Viewing Serial Output

When your firmware update completes, the board will reset, and begin by joining
the network. Let's use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output
from the board. We first need to select the serial port again, but this time it
will be a **different port** than the one we selected to communicate with the
bootloader. Once again, navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Port: Sparkfun SAMD21 Pro
RF**\), but make sure the serial device, either COM\# or ttyACM\#, is different!
Next navigate to \(**Tools &gt; Serial Monitor**\), you should begin to see
output similar to below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-arduino-terminal.png"
  )}
/>

Now let's head back to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com) and look at
our device page, you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/development/sparkfun-pro-rf/sparkfun-pro-rf-console-event-graph.png"
  )}
/>

Congratulations! You have just transmitted data on the Helium network! The next
step is to learn how to use your device data to build applications, visit our
Integrations docs [here](/use-the-network/console/integrations).
