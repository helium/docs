The ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRaWAN development board includes the popular
[Murata CMWX1ZZABZ-091](https://wireless.murata.com/type-abz-078.html) module,
which is powered by a
[STM32L072CZ ](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l072cz.html)microcontroller
and
[SX1276 ](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/sx1276)transceiver.
The board also includes a fully featured ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool
interface, LEDs, push-buttons, antenna, Arduinoâ„¢ Uno V3 connectors and USB OTG
connector in Micro-B format. Paired with the ST X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 Sensor
