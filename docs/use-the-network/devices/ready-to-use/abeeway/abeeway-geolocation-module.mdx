title: Abeeway Geolocation Module
description:
  The Abeeway Geolocation Module is a multi-technology fused location LPWAN
  module designed as the ideal platform to develop a wide range of IoT tracking
  solutions, minimizing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of IoT geolocation use
  cases. It allows your engineering to focus on the use case, to optimize
  time-to-market and cost by using less complex PCBs (all high-density devices
  being encapsulated), to reduce certification risk and budget, as well as
  testing time and cost for mass production.
