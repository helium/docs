### Introduction

The Adeunis Field Test Device \(ARF8124A\) is a great tool for network testing.
It allows you to rapidly test network coverage at specific geographical
positions to verify that devices will have coverage.

### Add Device to Console

To start, you'll need to add your device to Console. You should have been
provided with a DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey from the seller of the device. Follow
our [quickstart](/use-the-network/console/quickstart) for instructions on how to
add a new device to Console.

### Device Configuration

The following device configuration changes are required for the device to
function properly on the Helium Network. Although the Adeunis IoT Configurator
application makes the device configuration much easier, it does not allow you to
change all the required settings, so we must use a serial utility. We are using
Realterm for our serial utility, but any will work, just be sure to use the
correct serial settings and send the commands in the correct format.

[Realterm - Serial Utility](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/)

#### Serial Settings
