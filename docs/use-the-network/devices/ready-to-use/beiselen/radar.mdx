description:
  DigiSilo is a compact distance measurement device and presence detector. Its sensor is a low
  power, high precision, pulsed short-range radar sensor and can measure in a distance range from 50
  cm to 7 meters. By operating in the 60 GHz unlicensed ISM radio band, the radar sensor provides
  robust performance without interference from noise, dust, color nor direct or indirect light.
  DigiSilo is made for silo monitoring with different mediums like grain, feedstock, flour, or
  liquids. The device is designed to be mounted outside on top of the non-metallic silo.
