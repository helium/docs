### Introduction

The
[Digital Matter Oyster](https://www.digitalmatter.com/devices/oyster-lorawan/)/[Yabby](https://www.digitalmatter.com/devices/yabby-lorawan/)
are rugged IP67 rated battery powered GPS tracking devices. This guide will show
you the hardware and software setup steps required to provision and onboard
these devices on the Helium Network.

Functionally, the Oyster and Yabby are both battery powered GPS tracking
devices. Their main differences lie in form factor and battery life.

[Yabby LoRaWAN Configuration and Usage Guide](https://support.digitalmatter.com/support/solutions/articles/16000077618-configuration-and-usage-guide)

### Hardware

- Digital Matter Oyster/Yabby
- 3 x AA 1.5V Batteries \(Oyster\)
- 3 x AAA 1.5V Batteries \(Yabby\)
- Digital Matter Configuration Cable
- Digital Matter Yabby Configuration Cable Adapter \(Yabby only\)

### Software

- [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)
- [Oyster Configuration Tool ](https://www.oemserver.com/tools/OysterLoRaWAN/ConfigTool/setup.exe)\(Windows\)
- [Yabby Configuration Tool ](https://www.oemserver.com/tools/YabbyLoRaWAN/ConfigTool/setup.exe)\(Windows\)

### Hardware Setup

The _Oyster and Yabby take 3 cells of their respective battery types. \(AA and
AAA\)_

The Oyster uses a
[FTDI TTL to USB Serial Converter Cable](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232RG_CABLES.pdf)

    )}
  />
</div>

This cable plugs into the four-pin connector below the battery compartment.

The Yabby uses the same cable, but will need an additional adapter for the Pogo
pins.

</div>

Once the devices have been provisioned and the batteries are populated, the
enclosure can be sealed by using the included screws.

That’s it for hardware setup!

### Software Setup

The Oyster/Yabby ship with a pre-provisioned AppEUI and AppKey. If you choose to
use these credentials, you can leave the AppEUI and AppKey fields blank in the
Windows utility. If you’d like to provision the device with new credentials, you
must copy the AppEUI and AppKey from the device
[created in Console](/use-the-network/console/adding-devices).

The basic parameters of interest are as follows:

```text
General:
In Trip Fix : hh:mm:ss : Will determine transmission frequency

Basic LoRaWAN:
	Region : US915 [1.0.2B]
	Sub-Band : 2 (ch. 8-15, 70)
	Activation : OTAA
	JoinEUI / AppEUI : [ Blank to use pre-provisioned / AppEUI from Console ]
	NwkKey (1.1) / AppKey (1.0) : [ Blank to use pre-provisioned / AppKey from Console ]

```

#### Connecting your device

When you plug in your cable, your PC will assign it a COM port, which you can
retrieve from the Device Manager from the _**Ports \(COM & LPT\).**_

To access the device manager, press the Windows key on your keyboard and search
for "Device Manager".

Windows Device Manager

Select the corresponding port from the drop-down list in the top right of the
utility and click _**Start**_.

If the Program Firmware and Program Parameters boxes are left unchecked, the
utility will continuously read and display the current device settings without
applying changes.

Current Device Settings and Transaction List

You can check logs by clicking the DevEUI List button on the top left, which
will show a list of scanned DevEUIs and transactions. Each time a device is
programmed, the parameter list will flash, and the DevEUI list will update. This
list is available in CSV format, so it can be conveniently imported into a
spreadsheet.

To program the new parameters and firmware, enter the desired parameters in the
right-hand column, and check the corresponding boxes to update _**firmware**_
and/or _**parameters**._ When you are finished, you may hit _**Stop**_, and
disconnect your device.

Once the device has been configured, it will attempt to join the Helium Network
by transmitting join requests. If the device has been configured properly in
Console and has knowledge of the device’s AppEUI and AppKey, the Hotspot that
hears the join request will send a join-accept message and allow the device to
join the network and transmit data.

### Usage

These devices use an accelerometer to detect movement, allowing it to decide
when an asset is in-trip and when it is stationary. This allows it schedule
battery-hungry GPS fixes when appropriate, to optimize battery life. Each time a
status update is scheduled, the device will attempt a GPS fix, then transmit
results \(regardless of whether a fix succeeded or not\).

### Device Payload

A sample device payload is as follows:

```text
DCCF3816BF5046B70000D3
```

When decoded becomes:

```text
{
  "type": "position",
  "latitudeDeg": 37.282198,
  "longitudeDeg": -122.0128577,
  "inTrip": false,
  "fixFailed": false,
  "headingDeg": 0,
  "speedKmph": 0,
  "batV": 5.275,
  "manDown": null
}
```

To learn more about decoding this payload, you may use this
[utility](https://www.oemserver.com/tools/OysterLoRaWAN/UplinkDecoder.html). To

This spreadsheet will help estimate approximate battery life of the Digital
Matter Oyster. Simply modify the fields to represent the desired number of
transmissions within a day.

### myDevices/Cayenne Integration

Helium now supports myDevices and the Cayenne LPP \(low power payload\) format.
Cayenne features a simple drag and drop interface that allows developers,
designers and engineers quickly prototype and share their connected device
projects.

:::info

myDevices currently only includes the Digital Matter Oyster in their device
library.

When you are adding a device/widget in Cayenne, look for the **Digital Matter
Oyster** under **Helium.**

Copy the device's **DevEUI** into the field. This value should correspond to the
associated Digital Matter Oyster DevEUI in **Console.** Then, click **Add
device.**
