description:
  Device with a set of environmental sensors capable of collecting different
  variables to evaluate the conditions of the air that surrounds it. This device
  measures the concentration of CO, SO2, NO2, O3, NO, H2S, CO2, the particles
  suspended in the air (PM2.5 and PM10) and TVOC. Developed based on the
  guidelines set forth in the framework Directive 96/62/EC of the council and
  all its Daughter Directives.
