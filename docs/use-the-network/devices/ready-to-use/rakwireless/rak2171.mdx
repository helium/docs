## WisNode TrackIt Helium Integration

:::tip

Before going through each and every step in connecting RAK2171 to Helium, it is recommended to check first the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK2171/Quickstart/).

:::

This guide shows how to register the TrackIt device in the Helium console and make integration to Datacake, where you can use the dashboard to view the data in a more user-friendly way. 

Before you dive into registering the device in the Helium console and creating the Datacake integration, you need to set the device to work in [Third-Party LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) Mode](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK2171/Quickstart/#third-party-lorawan-network-server-lns-mode).

### Register the TrackIt Node in the Helium Console

1. Login to your Helium console account. If you do not have one, head to the web page and create one. Once you are logged in, you will see the Welcome window.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/1.console-page.png"
  )}
/>



2. In the menu on the left side of the console, select **Devices** and click the **Add new device** button to register your device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/2.console-devices-page.png"
  )}
/>


3. In the **Name** field, type the preferred name of your device.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/3.add-device.png"
  )}
/>

4. You can see that the Helium console generates random **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key**. Since the TrackIt keys cannot be changed, you need to type your keys in the fields. These keys are found in the TrackIt application in the LoRaWAN Working Mode (Third Party NS).


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/4.trackit-keys.png"
  )}

    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/21.joined-device.png"
  )}
/>


### Configure the Device in Datacake

1. You need to decode the raw data the device sends to Datacake for a more user-friendly preview. On the device page of the Datacake console, you can find different tabs like **Dashboard**, **History**, and **Downlinks**. For now, head on to the **Configuration** tab.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/22.dashboard.png"
  )}
/>


2. Scroll down until you find the **Payload Decoder** field.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/23.configuration-page.png"
  )}
/>


3. In the **Payload Decoder** field, copy and paste the code below. Then click the **Save** button below the decoder field.

```js

function Decoder(bytes, port) {
    var decoded = {};

    // adjust time zone, here Asia/Manila = +8H
    var my_time_zone = (8 * 60 * 60);

    decoded.num = bytes[1];
    decoded.app_id = (bytes[2] << 24) | (bytes[3] << 16) | (bytes[4] << 8) | bytes[5];
    decoded.dev_id = (bytes[6] << 24) | (bytes[7] << 16) | (bytes[8] << 8) | bytes[9];
    switch (bytes[0]) {
        case 0xCA: // No Location fix
            decoded.acc = 0;
            decoded.fix = 0;
            decoded.batt = bytes[10];
            decoded.time = ((bytes[11] << 24) | (bytes[12] << 16) | (bytes[13] << 8) | bytes[14]);
            // adjust time zone
            decoded.time = decoded.time + my_time_zone;
            var dev_date = new Date(decoded.time * 1000);
            decoded.time_stamp = dev_date.getHours() + ":" + dev_date.getMinutes();
            decoded.date_stamp = dev_date.getDate() + "." + (dev_date.getMonth() + 1) + "." + dev_date.getFullYear();
            decoded.stat = bytes[15] & 0x03;
            decoded.gps = bytes[15] & 0x0C;
            break;
        case 0xCB: // Location fix
            decoded.fix = 1;
            decoded.batt = bytes[20];
            decoded.time = ((bytes[21] << 24) | (bytes[22] << 16) | (bytes[23] << 8) | bytes[24]);
            // adjust time zone
            decoded.time = decoded.time + my_time_zone;
            var dev_date = new Date(decoded.time * 1000);
            decoded.time_stamp = dev_date.getHours() + ":" + dev_date.getMinutes();
            decoded.date_stamp = dev_date.getDate() + "." + (dev_date.getMonth() + 1) + "." + dev_date.getFullYear();
            decoded.stat = bytes[25] & 0x03;
            decoded.gps = bytes[25] & 0x0C;
            decoded.lng = (((bytes[10] << 24) | (bytes[11] << 16) | (bytes[12] << 8) | bytes[13]) * 0.000001).toFixed(4);
            decoded.lat = (((bytes[14] << 24) | (bytes[15] << 16) | (bytes[16] << 8) | bytes[17]) * 0.000001).toFixed(4);
            decoded.location = decoded.lat + "," + decoded.lng;
            decoded.acc = bytes[18];
            decoded.gps_start = bytes[19];
            break;
        case 0xCC: // SOS 
            decoded.sos = 1;
            decoded.lng = (((bytes[10] << 24) | (bytes[11] << 16) | (bytes[12] << 8) | bytes[13]) * 0.000001).toFixed(4);
            decoded.lat = (((bytes[14] << 24) | (bytes[15] << 16) | (bytes[16] << 8) | bytes[17]) * 0.000001).toFixed(4);
            if (bytes.length > 18) {
                var i;
                for (i = 18; i < 28; i++) {
                    decoded.name += bytes[i].toString();
                }
                for (i = 28; i < 40; i++) {
                    decoded.country += bytes[i].toString();
                }
                for (i = 39; i < 50; i++) {
                    decoded.phone += bytes[i].toString();
                }
            }
            break;
        case 0xCD:
            decoded.sos = 0;
            break;
        case 0xCE:
            decoded.alarm = 0x01;
            decoded.alarm_lvl = bytes[10];
            break;
    }
    return decoded;
}

```

4. Now you can see the decoded data you receive in the Debug tab.

6. To create a field, in the **Configuration** tab for the device in the Datacake console, scroll down to the **Fields** field and click the **+ Add Field** button. In the **Add Field** window, fill in the following information based on the table above:

- **Type** – Type of the field.
- **Name** – Name of the field. Note that you can type a name of your choice. The above names are just a template.
- **Identifier** – The decoder decodes the data in fields. The identifier must be exactly the name of the field of the decoded data (e.g. TIME_STAMP for the Time Stamp field). Note that field names cannot be changed.
- **Unit (optional)** – The unit of the value (e.g. V for battery (volts)).
- **Use formula** - Formulas can be used to perform calculations on values based on other fields.


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/25.add-field.png"
  )}
/>

For example, to create a **LOCATION** field, choose **Geolocation** in the **Type** field. For the **Identifier** field, type the name of the decoded data field: **LOCATION**.


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/26.location-field.png"
  )}
/>

7. When you enter the required information, click **Add Field**. You will see the created field in the **Field** tab. Once a packet is received, the field will take the value of the identifier.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/27.created-a-field.png"
  )}
/>

Another example is if you want to create a field for the battery level. Click again **+ Add Field**, and select **Integer** in the **Type** field. Type **Battery** in the **Name** field and **BATT** in the **Identifier** field.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/28.battery-field.png"
  )}
/>


8. Do the same with the other fields. It is up to you to decide on what fields are required for your project. Make sure you select the right **Type** and enter the correct **Identifier**.

9. Now that the fields are created, head to the **Dashboard** of the device. Activate the **Edit mode** using the switch <img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/icon.png" )} /> and click **+ Add Widget**. You can create a widget to preview the data in the dashboard. Choose the correct widget for the desired field.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/29.widgets.png"
  )}
/>

For example, when creating a map, click the **Map (Displays a map)** widget.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/30.map-widget.png"
  )}
/>

10. In the **Basics** tab, you can type a name for the widget. In the **Appearance** tab, you can set a design to your widget (color, style). The **Data** tab is most important. Here you need to select the location field you have created above. Click the **+ Add field** and select the **Location** field. In addition, in the **Timeframe** tab, you can enable whether the map will show historical data.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak2171/31.map-field.png"
  )}
/>
