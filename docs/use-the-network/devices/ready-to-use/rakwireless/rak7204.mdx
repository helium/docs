## Connecting to Helium (The People's Network) 

:::tip
Before going through each and every step in Connecting the RAK7204 to Helium, it is recommend to check first our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK7204/Quickstart/)
:::

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network with more than 27,000 devices deployed globally. All our node products are compatible with it and the process of adding a device to the network is intuitive and straightforward. This section will focus on giving a brief guide on how to connect the RAK7204 to the network console, assuming that there is a Helium Hotspot within range.

Log in or create your account [here](https://www.helium.com/console):

<img

    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7204/1.png"
  )}
/>


Once registered/logged in you will end up at the home page where you can see your function tree on the left and your DC balance at the tops as well as a number of useful links.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7204/home.png"
  )}
/>


Go to the "Devices" section in the function tree. If this is your first time doing this there will be no devices registered. Click the "+ Add Device" button to get started


<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7204/no_dev.png"
  )}
/>

A window will pop up with a set of field containing the device parameters required for its registration:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7204/red_device.png"
  )}
/>


Fill a name of your choosing. The Dev EUI, App EUI and App Key (press the eye icon to reveal the values) will have random values generated for you by default. You can manually replace them with values of your own. For the purpose of this tutorial we will stay with the default. Press the "Submit" button and you are done.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7204/reged_device.png"
  )}
/>

Now your RAK7204 is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen we need to import the Dev EUI, App EUI and App Key in the RAK7204 using the RAK Serial Port Tool

Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Then start importing your settings.

Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the EU868 band and OTAA (only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (default one, does not need configuring).

- Regional band and activation mode setting

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```


- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

Same as with the Device EUI, replace the XXXX with your value:

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter App Key

Finally fill in the App key with the command:

```
at++set_config=lora:app_key:XXXX
```

- Join Network

Finish executing the join command in order for the node to initiate the join procedure.

Once the procedure is initiated and successfully complete you will have a notification in the serial console

```
at+join
```

You output should resemble the one in figure below:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/devices/ready-to-use/rakwireless/rak7204/join.png"
  )}
/>


If you take a look at the Helium console you will also see the join request packets both in the graph and event log. Your node is now a part of the Helium Network :tada:.
