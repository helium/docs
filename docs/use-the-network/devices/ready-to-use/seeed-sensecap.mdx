### Introduction
The SEEED SenseCAPs are are a series of industrial IoT products primarity centered around Smart Agriculture. They are based on the LoRaWAN protocol and deployable worldwide with multiple ISM bands. SenseCAPs are encapsulated in IP66 enclosures, making them applicable in outdoor remote sensing scenarios such as Smart Farming, Smart City, and other IoT applications that need low-power, long-distance, and long-term data collection.

### Programming the SenseCAP
To reprogram the SenseCap, you will need a TTL/Serial cable. I added some 90 degree headers on the base unit to make it easier to connect a molex connector, but you may can make do with sliding some pins in there and holding them at an angle to maintain contact.
Only connect the Ground and the TX/RX lines; leave the 3v3 pin disconnected.
At this point, we can either connect to the device directly using a serial terminal, or use the SenseCAP GUI utility \(for Windows and Mac only ATM\) found [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP-Node-Configuration-Tool).

</div>

Connect your cable, turn the unit on, and then tap the Reset button while holding the Set button. This will put you into programming mode.
Following that, either jot down your Device EUI/App EUI/App Key from the right pane in the utility and enter those into the Helium Console, or get the Helium keys from the Console, enter them in this utility, and write them down to the node.

</div>

Voila!
Unplug your cable, hit the reset button, wait for the red LIVE led to flash a few times, and you should see an activation come across your Helium Console! At this point, carefully replace the sensor cap, and you should be good to go!
