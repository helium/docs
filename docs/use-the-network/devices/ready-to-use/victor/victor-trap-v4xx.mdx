[Device Manual](https://helium-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/V450-V460-Vlink-User-Manual-US.pdf)

### Add device in Console

To start, you'll need to create a Helium Console account and add your device.
You should have been provided with a DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey from your
seller, which are needed to add the device. Follow our
[quick start for instructions](/use-the-network/console/quickstart).

### Integration Configuration for VLINK

Once you have added your device to Console, you'll next need to create an
integration to send your device data to Victor VLINK.

#### 1. Create HTTP Integration

To start, we'll create a new HTTP integration in Console. Click the plus icon
in the lower right corner of your Console window and select `Add Integration`.

Next, select the HTTP integration icon.

    "img/use-the-network/console/integrations/integrations-select-http.png"
  )}
/>

Next we'll fill in the details, see instructions and image below.

1. Enter the VLINK Endpoint URL:
   `https://ibgsq3pdbl.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/default/console-to-victormouse-translator`
2. Enter the HTTP Header - Key: `x-api-key` and Value:
   `peKuqRvLce7CuqUE0EkR1aE9bt0Hy3nJnYSh7yM3`
3. Enter the name for this Integration: _VLINK Integration_
4. Finally, click _Add Integration_ to complete.

  )}

#### 2. Attach Integration to Device with Flows

Next we'll attach the `VLINK Integration` to the device. Navigate to your
Flows page with the navigator on the left. Next, click the plus icon next
to `nodes` at the top. Here you will first drag your device out on to the 
flows space and then your new `VLINK Integration`. To attach the two, click
the small circle on the right of the device node and then click the small 
circle on the left of the integration node. Finally, click save at the very 
bottom to implement your flow.

### Add Device to VLINK Platform

have received these account details when you purchased the device.

You are now ready to add your device to VLINK and power on your device in range
of a Hotspot. See VLINK onboarding instructions
