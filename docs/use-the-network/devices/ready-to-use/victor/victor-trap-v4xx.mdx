### Add device in Console

To start, you'll need to create a Helium Console account and add your device.
You should have been provided with a DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey from your
seller, which are needed to add the device. Follow our
[quick start for instructions](/use-the-network/console/quickstart).

### Integration Configuration for VLINK

Once you have added your device to Console, you'll next need to create an
integration to send your device data to Victor VLINK.

#### 1. Create HTTP Integration

To start, we'll create a new HTTP integration in Console. Navigate to the
Integrations page using the left navigation and then select the HTTP
integration.

3. Enter the name for this Integration: _VLINK Integration_
4. Create and apply a Label for this Integration, we've used the same name as
   the integration.
5. Finally, click _Add Integration_ to complete.
