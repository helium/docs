# Data Only Hotspot Setup with RAK Concentrator + Raspberry Pi

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

A Data Only Hotspots is a variation of Hotspots that can participate on the
Helium Network by transferring data from the end devices (LoRaWAN nodes), they
are eligible for Network Data Transfer Rewards but not Proof of Coverage
Rewards.

This guide covers all the steps needed to set up a Data Only Hotspot using a
WisLink RAK LPWAN concentrator module and a Raspberry Pi, you will find more
details about which models/references are supported in the requirements section.
This configuration can be achieved by installing the ***helium_gateway***
service available on the [gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs)
repository.

:::warning
Data Only Hotspots cannot earn $HNT, at least for now, and after milestone 2
they will earn $HNT only for Device Packet Transfer. Remember to keep an eye on
[Light Hotspots Project](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/light-hotspots)
and the **#gateway-development** channel on the
[Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium) to check how the development
process evolves.
:::

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi, multiple families are supported, however not all the models have
been tested yet, so it's highly recommended to follow this guide with a model of
the families Pi 3 or Pi 4.

- The concentrator module and the proper Pi HAT to interface it with the
Raspberry Pi. The following table contains the links to the detailed information
available at the RAK store.

Let's get started!

## Packet forwarder preparation

To get started you must set up the packet forwarder and get some helpful
configuration tools used across this guide.

#### Option 1

You can follow this
[installation procedure](https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway#installation-procedure)
if you are already familiar with the Raspberry Pi, and the RAK concentrator
modules. Furthermore, it's highly recommended to start from a fresh
[Raspbian Buster Lite image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/)
(now called'Raspberry Pi OS Lite').

#### Option 2

You can also follow the Quick Start Guide for your concentrator on the
[RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/#wislink-lpwan).

- [RAK2287]
- [RAK2247]
- [RAK2245]

[RAK2247]: https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2247/Quickstart/
[RAK2245]: https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Quickstart/

### Select the region plan

Enter the gateway configuration interface by using the following command.
```
sudo gateway-config
```

Select the *Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan* option, then *Server is TTN*, and in
the last step choose the proper plan according to your country. For instance,
the image shows the option to select US915. To finish, press OK.

<img

    "img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-gateway-config-interface-region-plan.png"
  )}
/>

### Verify if the packet forwarder is running

When the LoRa packet forwarder is running as a service, some log messages are
recorded in the syslog. To inspect the logs, run the following command:
```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep ttn-gateway
```

The log output should show something similar to:
```
rak-gateway ttn-gateway[1886]: JSON up: {"stat":{"time":"2021-07-21 16:25:00 GMT","rxnb":0,"rxok":0,"rxfw":0,"ackr":0.0,"dwnb":0,"txnb":0,"temp":0.0}}

```

:::note
`ttn-gateway` is just the name for the LoRa packet forwarder service in the
configuration for these RAK concentrators; this is like a "legacy name" that
doesnâ€™t change when using different network servers.
:::

### Edit the packet forwarder settings

You will need to edit some basic options in the packet forwarder configuration
to forward the packets to the address and port the helium_gateway service is
listening to.

Select the option *Edit packet-forwarder config* within the *gateway-config*
interface. This option will open the `global_conf.json` file using the nano
editor. Then, set the *server_address* to 127.0.0.1 and the *server ports* to
1680, as follows:

<img
  className="docsheader"
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-packet-forwarder-settings.png"
  )}
/>

Close the editor by pressing CTRL + X, press ENTER to save the file and restart
the packet forwarder to apply the changes by selecting the option *Restart
packet-forwarder* within the *gateway-config* interface.

:::important
Every time a new region is selected using the *Setup RAK Gateway Channel Plan*
option, these settings are replaced with the default configuration. So, make
sure to keep this in mind if you modify the region later.

## Helium Gateway service installation

### Downloading the package

Download the latest release from the
[gateway-rs](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) repository, and set the
`<version>` according to
[the latest release](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases). You can
download it in any directory, for example `/tmp`.

#### Option 1

Getting from the repo directly to the Raspberry Pi by running the following
commands.
```
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs/releases/download/<version>/helium-gateway-<version>-raspi234.deb
```

#### Option 2

You can also download it to your computer and pass it to the Raspberry Pi
through the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).

```
scp helium-gateway-<version>-raspi234.deb pi@<gateway ip>:/tmp/
```

### Installing the package

Run the following command in the same directory you downloaded the package to
install the *helium_gateway* service in the operating system.

```
sudo dpkg -i helium-gateway-<version>-raspi234.deb
```

### Region configuration

The default region of the *helium_gateway* service is US915, so you can continue
with the next section if you are using this one. Otherwise, you must set your
region frequency in `/etc/helium_gateway/settings.toml`. Add the following line
at the beginning of the file:

```
region = "<region>"
```
Possible values are: `US915 | EU868 | EU433 | CN470 | CN779 | AU915 | AS923 |
KR920 | IN865`.

For instance, if your region is EU868 the content in `settings.toml` must be.

```
region = "EU868"

[log]
method = "syslog"
level = "info"
timestamp = false

[update]
platform = "raspi234"
```

After updating the value, you need to restart the *helium_gateway* service to
apply the changes.
```
sudo systemctl restart helium_gateway
```

## Verifying the installation

### Inspecting the service logs

The service starts after installation automatically. You can check the execution
logs by running the following command.

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep helium_gateway
```

The first log messages should look like these ones.
```
rak-gateway helium_gateway[23658]: starting, module: gateway

```

Whenever you need to restart the service you can use the command below.

```
sudo systemctl restart helium_gateway
```

### Getting some information about the hotspot

Use the following command to get the public key address and animal name of your
hotspot.

```
helium_gateway key info
```

This command should give you an output like the following one.

```
{
  "address": <hotspot address>,
  "name": <hotspot name>
}
```

#### Backup the gateway_key

The `gateway_key.bin` file located at /etc/helium_gateway stores the information
used to identify the hotspot on the Helium Network. It's highly advised to 
backup this file, especially if you need to recover it later after the
onboarding process.

Using SCP could be an option to do the backup; that would be something like
this.

```
scp pi@<gateway ip>:/etc/helium_gateway/gateway_key.bin <destination directory>
```

If you are using Windows, you can try a tool like
[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) too.

### Testing the packet transfer with an end device

If you have an end device (LoRaWAN node), you can check if the hotspot can
transfer packets through the network. In other words, you can check if the
devices can send data to the Helium Console. The Helium Console is where you can
provision and manage the end devices, so the nodes need to be registered to 
start using the network.

#### Some comments and recommendations about the Helium Console

At least for now, it is recommended to use the staging console instead of the
production one when we are transferring data through Data Only hotspots. You can
differentiate them for the URL they use,
[console.helium.com](https://console.helium.com/) for production, and
[staging-console.helium.wtf](https://staging-console.helium.wtf) for staging.
Don't be surprised if you find some differences between those console flavors,
basically staging is where the new features are tested before their rollout to
production.

:::important
If the device you will use for testing is registered on the production console,
it's better to delete it from there to avoid any unexpected behavior.
:::

To register your end device on the console, you can follow the steps described 
on [Adding Devices](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/adding-devices/).

#### Inspecting the packet transfer behavior

Make sure your device is configured or flashed with the same keys you registered
on the console. Then, when your device is ready to transmit data, take a look at
the log messages again.

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep helium_gateway
```

Power up or reset your device, every time it tries to send a message, you should
see the information related to the packet received by the hotspot and where it
is being routed.

```
rak-gateway helium_gateway[23658]: ignoring raw packet PushData(Packet { random_token: 18563, gateway_mac: MacAddress { bytes: [228, 95, 1, 255, 254, 3, 45, 43] }, data: Data { rxpk: Some([V1(RxPkV1 { chan: 4, codr: _4_5, data: [64, 11, 8, 0, 72, 0, 25, 1, 2, 138, 20, 173, 187, 16, 164, 246, 161, 241, 78, 16, 36, 238, 117, 161, 188, 240], datr: DataRate(SF7, BW125), freq: 904.7, lsnr: 13.2, modu: LORA, rfch: 1, rssi: -20, rssis: Some(-20), size: 26, stat: OK, tmst: 668364099 })]), stat: None } }), module: gateway
rak-gateway helium_gateway[23658]: routing packet to: http://54.193.165.228:8080/, module: router
```

If you are able to see this kind of logs your hotspot is working like a charm!
The logs will record more information according to the router/console state.

Now, you should start to see some events on the console. Sometimes, it could
take some minutes before you start to see any activity; wait for a bit of a
while and reset your device if it's needed.

<img
  className="docsheader"
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/mine-hnt/guides/rak-concentrators-guide-console-events.png"
  )}
/>

As a final check, you can compare if the Hotspot Name matches the one you
obtained before. It could be different if there are more hotspots providing 
overage around you. In that case, you can explore the *Multiple Packets*
configuration to purchase more packets when several hotspots hear the device.

## What's next?

At this point, your Data Only Hotspot is ready to be added to the blockchain!
You can find more information about that process
[here](/mine-hnt/data-only-hotspots#pre-requisites).
