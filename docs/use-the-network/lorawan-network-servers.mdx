## What is an LNS?

An LNS (LoRaWAN Network Server) is a vital component of a LoRaWAN network. Key functions include
device management, message routing, and integration with application servers. Network servers play a
crucial role in ensuring the scalability, reliability, and interoperability of LoRaWAN networks.

## What is the OpenLNS Initiative?

â€‹The OpenLNS initiative allows anyone looking to deploy devices on the Helium Network to use any
LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS). The LNS you choose must comply with the LoRaWAN specification to
access the Helium Network.

OpenLNS will deliver the following network improvements:

1. Increased accessibility
1. Accelerated device joins and a focus on increased speed
1. Increased reliability
1. Enabling massive scalability

## Connect and Manage Devices on Helium

There are a couple of options to get started onboarding devices and connecting through a Helium LNS:

### Work with a Professional LNS Service Provider

Professional hosting companies can provide support and immediate access to a ready-to-go
connectivity platform. LNS Services will vary in price, support, and features depending on the
company. Companies may offer public shared servers, and/or private servers.

### Host Your Own LNS

If you are comfortable setting up, configuring, and managing your own servers and plan to
self-manage your entire solution in-house, hosting your own LNS could be a good option for you. Note
that this requires expertise and ongoing hosting expenses.
