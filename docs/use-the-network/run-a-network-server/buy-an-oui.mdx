## What is an OUI?

Each LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) on the Helium Network acquires an Organizationally Unique
Identifier ("OUI"). This registers the LNS with the blockchain and allocates two very important
routing objects owned and maintained by the OUI operator:

- up to five **filters**, describing the sets (AppEUI, DevEUI) expected by the LNS
- one or more **slabs** of DevAddrs, reserving an address space for the OUI's devices on the Helium
  Network

A device, defined by (AppEui, DevEui), can be allocated any of the DevAddrs owned by the OUI. It is
even possible to multiplex many devices on the same DevAddr at the same time, using the Message
Integrity Check (MIC) to disambiguate.

:::info

Based on benchmarking tests the upper limit for a DevAddr `1024` slab is approximately 5800 devices,
but results still need to be replicated and bracketed. Community members are encouraged to run their
own benchmarking tests. Instructions
[here](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/router-benchmarking). Requires basic familiarity with
Linux and Bash command-line.

## Pricing

The OUI is purchased with [Data Credits (DC)](/blockchain/transaction-fees). Costs are subject to
change, but currently the OUI itself costs US$100 worth of DC and each DevAddr cost an additional
US$100 in DC.

DevAddr are sold in sequential blocks between 8 and 65,536 and any power of two.

You must purchase a slab when purchasing an OUI, therefore, the total minimum cost is US$900 worth
of Data Credits: $100 for the OUI itself and $800 for eight DevAddr's.

[The OUI purchase transaction itself](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_oui_v1.proto)
incurs a fee based as does any other blockchain transaction; generally this will be $0.35-1.00 worth
of DCs based on how the fields get filled and change the transaction size.

### Purchase Transaction

:::info Current Process

Please send an email to [hello@helium.foundation](mailto:hello@helium.foundation) to purchase an
OUI.

:::

<details>
<summary>Legacy Process</summary>

You need [the Helium wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) to go any further. You'll
want to [create a wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs#create-a-wallet) and to have at
least US$900 in HNT (based on current HNT Oracle pricing).

Submit a "create OUI" transaction:

```bash
./helium-wallet oui create --subnet-size 8
```

The filter is a dummy filter to initialize the OUI. When you get Console running, it will
automatically maintain it. You can once again track the transaction with the endpoint above. When it
is complete, you should also see your OUI as the most recently purchased and
[on the list here](https://api.helium.io/v1/ouis).

Congratulations! You are the proud owner of a Helium Network OUI. OUIs are numbered sequentially, so
the lower you are, the earlier you were on the Network!

## DevAddr Explained

Device addresses or `DeviceAddr` are assigned to a device by the LNS during the join procedure
[See LoRaWAN Spec here for more info about Joins](https://lora-alliance.org/resource_hub/lorawan-specification-v1-0-3/).

### Why & when should I purchase more `DeviceAddr`?

When starting up your Helium LNS (Router / Console) you will probably be wondering, how many
`DeviceAddr` do you need? This depends on a few factors:

1. number of devices
1. location / concentration of devices

To better figure out the right number for you, you will need to understand how `DeviceAddr` are
assigned to Devices by Router.

### Couple things to know before

First you will need a basic understanding of the location system used by the Helium Network
[Full Description](/wallets/app-wallet/hexagons/). If you are aware of `H3 Indexes` & `Hexagons` you
can skip this.

Then let's talk about the offer / purchase machanism on the Helium Network.

The Helium Network (HN) is not your "typical" LoraWan Network in which a Hotspot (or Gateway) will
send its packets to an LNS directly and for "free". In the HN, a Hotspot will make an offer to the
appropriate LNS and if said LNS decided to purchase it, the hotspot will then deliver the "full"
packet to the LNS. Note that the LNS can refuse an offer from a Hotspot if it thinks that it is not
interested by the data from this device.

:::info

Offers only contain:

- the routing information for a packet (`DeviceAddr` for uplinks or `EUIs` for join)
- a hash of the packet, to not reveal its content but still be uniquely trackable by the LNS
- the Hotspot it came from

:::

:::info

Note that a Console Organization is only ever charged when a packet is received and properly
identified. Only Router's balance is charged during the offer / purchase process.

:::

### Assigning a `DeviceAddr`

When a device joins the Helium Network it is assigned a `DeviceAddr` based on the location of the
hotspot that the device is communicating through. Router will lookup the hotspot's location and find
its parent hexagon at [resolution 3](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/) (resolution 3 is
the default value but it can changed via the env variable `ROUTER_DevAddr_ALLOCATE_RESOLUTION`) it
will then assign the lowest `DeviceAddr` in its slab to the device. If another device was to join in
the same hexagon it would get the following `DeviceAddr` in the slab, ex:
`Device1 -> DevAddr1, Device2 -> DevAddr2`.

:::info

At resolution 3 (Average Hexagon Edge Length: 59.8 km), they are `41,162` unique hexagon in the
world, so a slab of `8 DeviceAddr` would provide `41,162 * 8 = 329,296` devices, see
[doc](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/).

:::

The maybe not so obvious problem here is: what if you have more devices than `DeviceAddr` in one
Hexagon? This is when conflicts can happen. A `DeviceAddr` conflict is when Router receives an offer
but cannot be entirely sure if the offer is from for `Device1` or `Device9`:

#### Example

You have 2 devices `Device1` and `Device9` both sending through the same hotspot and therefor in the
same resolution 3 hexagon. As we have 9 devices that have joined in the Hexagon, the assignment
rolled back to the first `DeviceAddr` and gave `Device9` the same `DeviceAddr1` as `Device1`.

- Assignment
  `Device1 -> DevAddr1, Device2 -> DevAddr2, ..., Device8 -> DevAddr8, Device9 -> DevAddr1`.
- Scenario: `Device1` is sending an uplink.

At this point 2 things can happen:

1. The Router identified the offer from the hotspot to be from `Device1`. The Router can then
   process the offer accordingly.
2. The Router **misidentify** the offer thinking that it is from `Device9` (as they both share
   `DeviceAddr1`)
   1. If Router deems offers associated with `Device9` worthy of purchasing, the offer will be
      purchased and then the packet will be properly identified via the `MIC` (Message Integrity
      Code,
      [see LoraWan spec for more info](https://lora-alliance.org/resource_hub/lorawan-specification-v1-0-3/)
      ). This is essentially a conflict with **happy path**.
   2. If Router does not deem offers associated with `Device9` worthy of purchasing (e.g. maybe
      `Device9` was de-activated by a user in Console, or maybe `Device9`'s Console Organisation ran
      out of [Data Credit](/data-credit)) the offer will be rejected and data never delivered. This
      is a conflict with **non-happy path**.

The non-happy path is fairly rare as Router will do its best to find out the right device but this
is where buying extra `DeviceAddr` can help prevent bad conflicts.

This should help you figure out the number of `DeviceAddr` that is right for you.

:::info

Moving devices can trigger the same effect as well as they can get an assigned `DeviceAddr` in our
Hexagaon and move to another one, potentially causing a conflict as specified above.
