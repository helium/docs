# What is an OUI?

Each LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) on the Helium Network acquires an Organizationally Unique
Identifier (OUI). This registers the LNS with the blockchain and allocates two very important
routing objects owned and maintained by the OUI operator:

- up to five **filters**, describing the sets (AppEUI, DevEUI) expected by the LNS
- one or more **slabs** of DevAddrs, reserving an address space for the OUI's devices on the Helium
  Network

A device, defined by (AppEui, DevEui), can be allocated any of the DevAddrs owned by the OUI. It is
even possible to multiplex many devices on the same DevAddr at the same time, using the Message
Integrity Check (MIC) to disambiguate.

:::info

Based on latest benchmarking tests the upper limit for a Devaddr `1024` slab is approximately 5800
devices, but results still need to be replicated and bracketed. Community members are encouraged to
run their own benchmarking tests. Instructions
[here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/router-benchmarking). Requires
basic familiarity with Linux and Bash command-line.

# OUI Cost

The OUI is purchased with [Data Credits (DC)](/blockchain/transaction-fees). Costs are subject to
change, but currently the OUI itself costs US$100 worth of DCs and each DevAddr cost an additional
US$100 in DC.

DevAddr are sold in sequential blocks between 8 and 65,536 and any power of two.

You must purchase a slab when purchasing an OUI, therefore, the total minimum cost is US$900 worth
of Data Credits: $100 for the OUI itself and $800 for eight DevAddr's.

[The OUI purchase transaction itself](https://github.com/helium/proto/blob/master/src/blockchain_txn_oui_v1.proto)
incurs a fee based as does any other blockchain transaction; generally this will be $0.35-1.00 worth
of DCs based on how the fields get filled and change the transaction size.

# Purchase Transaction

You need [the Helium wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) to go any further. You'll
want to [create a wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs#create-a-wallet) and to have at
least US$900 in HNT (based on current HNT Oracle pricing).

## Purchase the OUI

Submit a "create OUI" transaction:

```bash
./helium-wallet oui create --subnet-size 8 --filter wVwCiewtCpEKAAAAAAAAAAAAcCK3fwAAAAAAAAAAAABI7IQOAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAADBlAAAAAAAAAAAAADEAAAA2AAAAOgAAAA
```

The filter is a dummy filter to initialize the OUI. When you get Console running, it will
automatically maintain it. You can once again track the transaction with the endpoint above. When it
is complete, you should also see your OUI as the most recently purchased and
[on the list here](https://api.helium.io/v1/ouis).

Congratulations! You are the proud owner of a Helium Network OUI. OUIs are numbered sequentially, so
the lower you are, the earlier you were on the Network!
