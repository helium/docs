# Host Your Own Console

The Helium Network is unique in that it provides public wireless infrastructure for privately
operated LoRaWAN Network Servers. Details about how Helium blockchain primitives interoperate with
LoRaWAN routing can be read about [here](/lorawan-on-helium).

In this section, we will provide a step-by-step guide on actually getting a LoRaWAN Network Server
(LNS) based on Helium's open-source Console up and running.

- [buy an OUI](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/buy-an-oui)
- [run Console](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console)
- [deploy Console](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/deploy-console)
- Optionally [debug with sniffer](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/debug-with-sniffer) to
  confirm router runtime behavior using a virtual LoRaWAN device and a software-based protocol
  sniffer
- [Router benchmarking](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/router-benchmarking) for load &
  capacity of real LoRaWAN traffic in an isolated environment
  - Use this to help determine size of server instance to deploy
  - This document also gives insight to interactions of console, router, gateways, organizations,
    devices and wallets as used in production

Before pursuing this configuration though, it is worth considering.

**Do I need to own my own OUI and operate my own Console?**

- If you are developing a few prototype devices, it might not be time to operate a network server.
  Helium Foundation hosts and operates [Console](/use-the-network/console) where you can easily
  manage devices (up to 10) for a organization without dealing with OUI management; you only pay for
  packets and new accounts start with free 10,000 Data Credits (DC). To go beyond 10 devices check
  out Console Hosting Providers [here](/use-the-network/console/hosting-providers).

- An OUI costs 90,000,000 DC (U.S. $900 dollars) at a minimum (10,000,000 DC for the OUI and
  80,000,000 DC for the smallest address slab).
