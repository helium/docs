# Run a Network Server

The Helium Network is unique in that it provides public wireless infrastructure
for privately operated LoRaWAN Network Servers. Details about how Helium
blockchain primitives interoperate with LoRaWAN routing can be read about
[here](/lorawan-on-helium).

In this section, we will provide a step-by-step guide on actually getting a
LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) based on Helium's open-source Console up and
running.

- [buy an OUI](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/buy-an-oui)
- [run Console](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console)
- [deploy Console](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/deploy-console)
- Optionally [debug with sniffer](/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/debug-with-sniffer)
  to confirm router runtime behavior using a virtual LoRaWAN device and a
  software-based protocol sniffer

Before pursuing this configuration though, it is worth considering.

**Do I need to own my own OUI and operate my own Console?**

- If you are developing a few prototype devices, it might not be time to operate
  a network server. Helium hosts and operates
  [Console](/use-the-network/console) where you can easily manage devices for an
  organization without dealing with OUI management; you only pay for packets and
  new accounts start with a free 10,000 DC.

- An OUI costs $900 in Data Credits at a minimum ($100 for the OUI and $800 for
  the smallest address slab), so if that cost is prohibitive, use Helium's
  Console.
