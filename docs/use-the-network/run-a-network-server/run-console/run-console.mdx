# What is Console?

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

[Console](https://github.com/helium/console) is a project developed by Helium.
It provides a web browser front-end for users to manage organizations and
devices and a Helium Blockchain-compatible LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) called
[Router](https://github.com/helium/routerv3).

We are working on integrations with third-party LNS's such as Chirpstack, but at
this time, this is the only "plug-and-play" solution for operating an OUI. That
being said, the Router code is open-source and custom LNS implementations may be
derived by anyone already since OUI operation on the Helium Network is entirely
permissionless.

## Requirements

Before we begin, you should have the following:

- [purchased an OUI](/use-the-network/buy-an-oui) and noted its number
- installed Docker and docker-compose
- you have some spare HNT to burn ($10-100 worth), for funding your OUI address
- an Auth0 account for user account management
- at least an AWS t2.xlarge (or equivalent), especially if running both Console and its backend (Router) on one server

Optionally, you should also:

- have a fully sync'ed Miner or ETL instance to extract a snapshot from. To
  learn how to setup a Miner,
  [please read here](/mine-hnt/build-a-packet-forwarder#run-the-miner).
- be able to configure ports on a firewall

## Console Setup

### Clone the console repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helium/console.git
```

### Customize Console environment

```
cp templates/.env .env
```

Then edit `.env`. Here's an example of what it should look like:

```
SECRET_KEY_BASE=Rrb2Tz4/HOGtez3X81/5uGsdfxiwwbIesjiQBNkIcwafpXTHJoAPEHQk0Yhw4Nuc
CLOAK_SECRET_KEY=eAqx+rwji6pioOyanpzfxQH8cCS/M3vQjdQ5LeDcSqQ=
GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEY=Rrb2Tz4/FOGtez3X81/5uGsdfxiwwbIesjiQBNkIcwafpXTHJoAPEHQk0Yhw4Nuc
ROUTER_SECRETS=1524243720:Rrb2Tz4/HOGtez4X81/5uGsffxiwwbIesjiQBNkIcwafpXTHJoAPEHQk0Yhw4Nuc
OUI=4
SELF_HOSTED=true
ENV_DOMAIN=localhost:4000
AUTH_0_CLIENT_ID=NyfDZUfyT2thF7G56oazCsdGxO8GRZD6
AUTH_0_DOMAIN=router-dev.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_BASE_URL=https://router-dev.us.auth0.com
DATABASE_DB=console
DATABASE_HOST=postgres
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
```

The auth0 fields are taken from
[your auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) where you create an
app for Console:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/run-console-auth0-create-app.png"
  )}
/>

You'll want to extract the appropriate credentials:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/run-console-auth0-creds.png"
  )}
/>

While we are on the Auth0 dashboard, let's add some URIs that we will need for
later:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl(
    "img/use-the-network/run-a-network-server/run-console/run-console-auth0-uris.png"
  )}
/>

### Customize Router environment

We will do something similar for `.env-router`:

```bash
cp templates/.env-router .env-router
```

Then edit `.env-router`. Here's an example of what it should look like:

```
# Default Helium's seed nodes
ROUTER_SEED_NODES=/ip4/35.166.211.46/tcp/2154,/ip4/44.236.95.167/tcp/2154

# OUI used by router (https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/packet-purchasing)
ROUTER_OUI=4

# Default devaddr if we fail to allocate one
ROUTER_DEFAULT_DEVADDR=AAQASA==

# State Channel Open amount
ROUTER_SC_OPEN_DC_AMOUNT=2000

# State Channel block expiration
ROUTER_SC_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL=45

# Console's connection info (see https://github.com/helium/console)
ROUTER_CONSOLE_ENDPOINT=http://console:4000
ROUTER_CONSOLE_WS_ENDPOINT=ws://console:4000/socket/router/websocket
ROUTER_CONSOLE_SECRET=1524243720:Rrb2Tz4/HOGtez4X81/5uGsffxiwwbIesjiQBNkIcwafpXTHJoAPEHQk0Yhw4Nuc

# Max time to wait for uplinks in ms
ROUTER_FRAME_TIMEOUT=300

# Turn on/off xor filter worker (anything else than true is off)
ROUTER_XOR_FILTER_WORKER=true
```

The key point is that `ROUTER_CONSOLE_SECRET` from this file matches
`ROUTER_SECRETS` from `.env`. You can ignore these other fields for now, but we
can revisit them later.

### Run it!

Copy the local docker-compose file
```bash
cp templates/docker-compose-local.yaml docker-compose.yaml
```

`docker-compose up` builds Console and launches it with two other containers:
Router and Postgres. You might see `helium_router` crash a few times as it waits
for `helium_console` to start up and allow the socket connection between the
two.

If you go to `localhost:4000`, you should have an auth0 login available to you.
Just as a heads up, all of your important data is in the `data` in this
`console` directory.

This is a good time to open up port `2154` for incoming TCP connections. Things
may still work without that but performance will be degraded.

### Load a snapshot

Optionally, you can load a snapshot so that your Console is immediately ready
for action. Technically, the Router component of Console is what keeps up with
the blockchain. You can check its current height

```bash
docker exec helium_router router info height
```

You are likely quite a ways from the tip of the blockchain, but you can load a
snapshot from an active miner (or ETL instance or blockchain-node). Details
about how to do this are [here](/mine-hnt/build-a-packet-forwarder#snapshots).

Simply replace `miner` with `docker exec helium_router router` for most of the
commands to work.

### Create Data Credits

At this point, we have the software running and we have an OUI, but the
router does not have any DC to buy messages from the network. We need to burn
some HNT to DC for the router.

The cost for rurning a router is complex. See community member disk91.com's
[guide](https://www.disk91.com/2021/technology/lora/what-is-the-real-cost-of-helium-communication/)
and calculate how much you need for your planned usage. One million DC ($10)
can be a good number to start with.

The easiest way to calculate how many HNT to burn to get the number of DC you
need is to go to https://console.helium.com/datacredits and click on
`Purchase Data Credits`. Enter the amount of DC you need and click on
`Burn HNT to DC`. Helium Console shows how to burn the selected amount to the
Helium Console itself. We won't do that. Just note the amount (for example
`0.49043649`).

Let's get the address of the OUI/router.

```bash
$ docker exec helium_router router peer addr
/p2p/11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf
```

The string after the second slash,
`11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf`, is the libp2p address and
this is where we need to burn the DC.
Now return to your command line wallet and burn the HNT amount **with the
libp2p address of your OUI/router as payee**. Example:

```bash
helium-wallet burn --amount 0.49043649 --payee 11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf --commit
```

Once this transaction clears, we'll be ready for the next step.

### OUI Update

At this point, we have the software running and we have an OUI, but the
blockchain does not know that the address of Router is associated with the OUI.
Use the same libp2p address used in the previous step.

/p2p/11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf
```

OUI with.

```bash
$ helium-wallet oui update routers --oui 4 --nonce 1 --address 11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf --commit
```

Once this transaction clears, the network will know about the association. It
may take a few minutes, but once the transaction clears, your OUI will be able
to open and close state channels and update your device table on the blockchain.

Monitor the account in explorer to verify that Router is doing this
appropriately. eg:
`https://explorer.helium.com/accounts/11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf`

### Create Data Credits

Many fees benefit from
[implicit burn](/blockchain/transaction-fees#transaction-fees-and-implicit-burn),
including when paying for OUIs and DevAddr's (done previously when you
[purchased an OUI](/use-the-network/buy-an-oui), but your router needs a DC balance
to run.

The cost for rurning a router is complex. See community member disk91.com's
[guide](https://www.disk91.com/2021/technology/lora/what-is-the-real-cost-of-helium-communication/)
and calculate how much you need for your planned usage.

One million DC ($10) can be a good number to start with. The easiest way to calculate how many HNT to burn to get the number of DC you need is to go to https://console.helium.com/datacredits and click on `Purchase Data Credits`. Enter the amount of DC you need and click on `Burn HNT to DC`. Helium Console shows how to burn the selected amount to the Helium Console itself. We won't do that. Just note the amount (for example `0.49043649`).

Now return to your command line wallet and burn the HNT amount **with the libp2p address of your router as payee**. Example:

```bash
helium-wallet burn --amount 0.49043649 --payee 11xHXS5AgLyjYRCJ4ctcWcsMRULS8jro9Pb1GPaTG1neGk1dNcf --commit
```

### Test a Device

Login to your local Console instance (localhost:4000) and create an organization
and a device. If you ever need help with Console as a user,
[much documentation exists here](/use-the-network/console).

Once you've created the device on console, go to a terminal window on server
running Console and execute the following command to tell Router to update the
`xor filter` on the blockchain:

```bash
docker exec helium_router router device xor --commit
```

Give the transaction some time to process (you can track it on explorer). Once
it has been processed, you can try joining the device. If you see a successful
Join Request, then you are successfully running your private LoRaWAN Network
Server.

Congratulations!
