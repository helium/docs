# Build a Packet Forwarder

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

:::warning

The ability to earn from [Proof of Coverage](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/proof-of-coverage)
with anything other than an [Full Hotspot](/mine-hnt/full-hotspots) is not
supported.

Building your own packet forwarder enables data transfer rewards _only_,
**if and only if** you complete the setup process [here](/mine-hnt/data-only-hotspots).

## Packet Forwarder Architecture

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/use-the-network/setup-a-packet-forwarder/packet-forwarder-arch.png")} />

To be a Helium Miner, there are three principle components to know about

- **Packet Forwarder**: this is a utility that interacts with the radio
  front-end and sends and receives raw radio packets with the Helium Miner
- **Light Hotspot Client**: the Helium Blockchain comes into the picture here;
  light hotspot client is responsible for routing packets to the appropriate
  Router (see our Routing article) entering into microtransactions brokered
  via gRPC
- **Router**: a Helium compatible LoRaWAN Network Server, basically; this
  component is interested in receiving the packets relating to its devices and
  handles downlink responses when appropriate

Any device that can run an 8 channel LoRa front-end (such as SX1301 or
SX1302) can be used to participate in the Helium Network. The Light Hotspot
Client is designed to send and receive packets using the Semtech Gateways
Messaging Protocol (GWMP), making it compatible with almost every LoRaWAN
Gateway on the Market.

Many off-the-shelf LoRaWAN gateways work very well and using one of them gives
you one less thing to worry about as the Packet Forwarder is setup and ready to
go.

This guide, however, is for those that want a more hands-on experience. We will
essentially be assembling a LoRaWAN gateway with discrete parts, loading up an
open-source Linux distribution, compiling the packet forwarder, and running it
all ourselves. In short, we'll be learning gateways that hard way!

    This guide is experimental and for advanced users only, and you may run in
    to various issues trying to get this working.

### Example Custom Hardware

If you donâ€™t have your own hardware yet, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4B
running the latest
[64-bit RaspiOS](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/) image.

We recommend this configuration in particular if you are interested in running
the Miner on the gateway itself; it's easy to run
[our Docker image from Quay](https://quay.io/repository/team-helium/miner) on a
64-bit ARM system. If you choose to run the Miner elsewhere, it's possible to
downgrade all the way to a Pi0, for example, since you will only be running the
packet forwarder on the gateway.

RAK Wireless sells multiple "Pi Hats" that provide the 8-channel front-end:

- [the RAK2245 (SX1301)](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2245-pi-hat?variant=22914482733156)
- [the RAK2287 (SX1302)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wislink-lpwan/products/rak2287-lpwan-gateway-concentrator-module?variant=34533841535134)

Or you can check out their
[WisGate Developer](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-developer)
line where they provide bundles:

- the D3/D3+/D4/D4+/D4P are all based off of the RAK2245
- the D4H is based off of the RAK2245

Ultimately, which configuration works for you depends on your situation, but all
of them will work with this guide with little adjustment.

### Preparing the SD Card

You can create an SD card from this image by looking for the recently inserted
SD card in your system

```
$ ls -al /dev | grep sd
```

Generally, the timestamp is enough to indicate which device is the SD card. Next
write the image to the SD card. For example:

```
dd if=~/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-arm64.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```

Use the command `sync` to make sure the filesystem is written before trying to
remove the SD card. Once the `sync` command returns, you can eject and remove
the SD card from your system.

## Preparing RaspiOS

With a keyboard, mouse, and monitor plugged in, power on the Raspberry Pi.
Proceed through the guided RaspiOS setup where you will update your password,
configure your WiFi, etc.

Enable SPI and I2C using the raspi-config tool: `sudo raspi-config`

Select `Interface Options`, and enable `I2C` and `SPI` from within the menu
system. This is also a good time to enable SSH if you want it.

## Installing the Semtech Packet Forwarder

Depending on which SX130x radio you are running, you will want to select the
appropriate packet forwarder application.

#### Packet Forwarder SX1302

Pull down Helium's fork of the SX1302 packet forwarder:

`git clone https://github.com/helium/sx1302_hal.git`

Go into the directory and build:

```
$ cd sx1302_hal
$ make
```

Next, go into the the packet_forwarder directory, where we will create a link to
the reset script:

```
$ cd packet_forwarder
$ ln -s ../tools/reset_lgw.sh reset_lgw.sh
```

We will also create a link to the appropriate regional configuration. For
example:

```
ln -s global_conf.json.sx1250.US915 global_conf.json
```

We are now ready to test the start-up. From `~/sx1302_hal/packet_forwarder` try:

```
./lora_pkt_fwd
```

If you get the following output, you are good to go:

```
INFO: [main] concentrator started, packet can now be received
INFO: concentrator EUI: 0x????????????????
```

You are now ready to setup the [light hotspot client](/use-the-network/light-hotspots).
