Like many other Solana Ecosystem projects, Helium utilizes [Realms](https://realms.today) to organize and manage vote escrow tokens, delegation, and more.
Stakes can be created and later managed within Realms at any time.

## Landrush
For the first 10 days following the Solana migration, HNT holders are elegible to stake their HNT for a 'landrush' bonus of 3x the lock amount.<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup>

If a Landrush stake is moved after the first 10 days have lapsed, the landrush bonus is forfeited.

## Automatically Created Validator Stakes
For existing validators, a veHNT position is automatically created based on the existing staked position previously tied to Validators.
The [Validator migration guide](/solana/migration/validator-operator) is a valuable reference in understanding specific details for former Validator operators.

These positions are not automatically delegated to a subDAO and are set with a constant [lockup period](#lockup-period) by default.

As a note, Validator positions will appear in Realms as one large stake.  
`hntyv...` is the Solana mint address for HNT.

## Creating a Stake
Anyone with HNT in a wallet can create a stake using Realms either using an in-wallet browser or a browser-connected wallet.

This guide outlines using Realms with the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). To use Realms on a desktop browser, a Solana-compatabile browser wallet can be used (such as Phantom or Backpack).

The Helium Wallet App's browser can be accessed via the globe icon in the bottom navigation.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/realmsbrowser.png')} />
    <figcaption>veHNT can be managed via <code>https://realms.heliumvote.com/dao/hnt</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

Once your wallet has been connected to Realms, your token balances (or existing positions) will be displayed in the governance section of the Helium DAO.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/availabletokens.png')} />
    <figcaption>Stake positions can be made in the "My governance power" section of Realms</figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

As long as HNT is available in your linked account, new stakes can be created by tapping on the "Lock Tokens" button within the governance view.

</figure>

### Lockup Period
In order to build a secure voting system, Helium only allows votes from token holders willing to align themselves with the longterm health of the Helium Network. This is done by allowing holders to receive veHNT in proportion with the amount of time that the tokens are staked for. 

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/lockup.png')} />
    <figcaption>Selecting your lockup type, Cliff or Constant.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Cliff
Tokens are locked for a fixed duration and are released in full at the end of the defined lockup period.
Vote weight declines linearly until release.

:::note Example

You lock 10.000 tokens for two years. They are then unavailable for the next two years. After this time, you can withdraw them again.

:::

#### Constant
Tokens are locked indefinitely. At any time you can start the unlock process which lasts for the initially chosen lockup duration.
Vote weight stays constant until you start the unlock process, then it declines linearly until release.


:::note Example

You lock 10.000 tokens with a lockup duration of one year. After two years you decide to start the unlocking process. Another year after that, you can withdraw the tokens.

:::


### Duration
The duration of your cooldown is defined in days. The longer your tokens are staked, the greater the more veHNT will be issued. If you chose the 'Constant' lockup period, this duration takes affect after the 'Unlock' action is executed.

While it is possible to set a higher cooldown than 5 years by using the 'Custom Duration', no additional vote weight multiplier will be added.

</figure>

### Confirming your Stake
Once parameters are settled in the realms UI, you are now ready to create your veHNT position.

The Helium Wallet App will ask for confirmation before issuing the Solana transaction that creates the veHNT position.

## Managing Stakes
With Realms, it's a sizzling experience to take control of your HNT stakes, ensuring they're grilled to perfection.
Chew through stake delegation, transfers, and cooldowns like a master chef. Just remember, in this well-done world, it's all about finding the perfect balance to steak your claim. <span className="🥩">🥩</span>

### Delegating Stakes
A stake along will allow its holder to participate in Helium Network (HNT) governance, however it will not earn any token return until it is delegated to a subDAO.

Once a stake has been delegated, it can be undelegated 
<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/delegate.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 300 }} />
    <figcaption>veHNT positions can be delegated the IoT or Mobile network.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Splitting a Stake
A stake can be divided among multiple positions. This can be helpful if you wish to delegate your veHNT position to multiple networks (IOT or MOBILE) or set different lockup times to different positions.

Be warned, splitting a [Landrush](#landrush) position after the initial 10 day period will result in losing the multiplier.

### Transfer a Stake
Stakes can be transfered from one position into another within the same account. Positions can only be transfered to positions with a greater or equal duration. Only undelegated positions can be transfered. Staked tokens cannot be moved to other accounts.
This functionality is useful for consolidating positions. 
If no other compatabile positions exist in an account, the "Transfer" button will be disabled for a position.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
    <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/transfer.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 300 }} />
    <figcaption>This position will unlock over the period of 2 years once the unlock has been initiated.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Extending a Stake
As expected, extending a stake lengthens the amount of time it will take to unstake. Position holders may chose to extend a stake in order to gain a larger multiplier for voting power or delegation purposes.

### Unlocking a Stake (Cooldown)
If a stake was created with a 'constant' [lockup period](#lockup-period), the ability to 'Unlock' the position will be visible in the postion as long as the unlock has not yet been initiated.
A constant lockup position will first need to be unlocked before the cooldown period begins.

Unlocking the position will begin the unlocking process. The time this takes will depend on the duration set during the creation of the position.
