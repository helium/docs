Like many other Solana Ecosystem projects, Helium utilizes [Realms](https://realms.today) to
organize and manage vote escrow tokens, delegation, and more. Stakes can be created and later
managed within Realms at any time.

## Landrush

For the first 10 days following the Solana migration, HNT holders are elegible to stake their HNT
for a 'landrush' bonus of 3x the lock amount.<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>)</sup>

If a landrush stake is moved or split out of its original position after the first 10 days have
lapsed, the landrush bonus is forfeited.

## Automatically Created Validator Stakes

For existing validators, a veHNT position is automatically created based on the existing staked
position previously tied to Validators. The
[Validator migration guide](/solana/migration/validator-operator) is a valuable reference in
understanding specific details for former Validator operators.

These positions are not automatically delegated to a subDAO and are set with a constant
[lockup period](#lockup-period) by default.

As a note, Validator positions will appear in Realms as one large stake.  
`hntyv...` is the Solana mint address for HNT.

## Creating a Stake

Anyone with HNT in a wallet can create a stake using Realms either using an in-wallet browser or a
browser-connected wallet.

This guide outlines using Realms with the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). To use
Realms on a desktop browser, a Solana-compatabile browser wallet can be used (such as Phantom or
Backpack).

The Helium Wallet App's browser can be accessed via the globe icon in the bottom navigation.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/realmsbrowser.png')} />
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

Once your wallet has been connected to Realms, your token balances (or existing positions) will be
displayed in the governance section of the Helium DAO.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/availabletokens.png')} />
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

As long as HNT is available in your linked account, new stakes can be created by tapping on the
"Lock Tokens" button within the governance view.

</figure>

### Lockup Period

In order to build a secure voting system, Helium only allows votes from token holders willing to
align themselves with the longterm health of the Helium Network. This is done by allowing holders to
receive veHNT in proportion with the amount of time that the tokens are staked for.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/lockup.png')} />
  <figcaption>Selecting your lockup type, Cliff or Constant.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Cliff

Tokens are locked for a fixed duration and are released in full at the end of the defined lockup
period. Vote weight declines linearly until release.

:::note Example

You lock 10.000 tokens for two years. They are then unavailable for the next two years. After this
time, you can withdraw them again.

:::

#### Constant

Tokens are locked indefinitely. At any time you can start the unlock process which lasts for the
initially chosen lockup duration. Vote weight stays constant until you start the unlock process,
then it declines linearly until release.

:::note Example

You lock 10.000 tokens with a lockup duration of one year. After two years you decide to start the
unlocking process. Another year after that, you can withdraw the tokens.

:::

### Duration

The duration of your cooldown is defined in days. The longer your tokens are staked, the more veHNT
will be issued. If you chose the 'Constant' lockup period, this duration takes effect after the
'Unlock' action is executed.

While it is possible to set a higher duration than 4 years, no additional vote weight multiplier
will be added.

### Confirming your Stake

Once parameters are settled in the realms UI, you are now ready to create your veHNT position.

The Helium Wallet App will ask for confirmation before issuing the Solana transaction that creates
the veHNT position.

## Managing Stakes

With Realms, it's a sizzling experience to take control of your HNT stakes, ensuring they're grilled
to perfection. Chew through stake delegation, transfers, and cooldowns like a master chef. Just
remember, in this well-done world, it's all about finding the perfect balance to steak your claim. <span className="ðŸ¥©">ðŸ¥©</span>

### Delegating Stakes

A stake will allow its holder to participate in Helium Network (HNT) governance, however it will not
earn any token return until it is delegated to a subDAO.

Once a stake has been delegated, it can be undelegated in the same interface.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/realms/delegate.png')} style={{ maxHeight: 300 }} />
  <figcaption>veHNT positions can be delegated to the IoT or the Mobile network.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Splitting a Stake

A stake can be divided among multiple positions. This can be helpful if you wish to delegate your
veHNT position to multiple networks (IOT or MOBILE) or set different lockup times to different
positions.

Be warned, splitting a [Landrush](#landrush) position after the initial 10 day period will result in
losing the multiplier for the tokins being split or transfered off the position.

### Transfer a Stake

Stakes can be transfered from one position into another within the same account. Positions can only
be transfered to positions with a greater or equal duration. Only undelegated positions can be
transfered. Staked tokens cannot be moved to other accounts. Landrush positions cannot be
transfered. This functionality is useful for consolidating positions. If no other compatible
positions exist in an account, the "Transfer" button will be disabled for a position.

  <figcaption>
    This position will unlock over the period of 2 years once the unlock has been initiated.

</figure>

### Extending a Stake

As expected, extending a stake lengthens the amount of time it will take to unstake. Position
holders may chose to extend a stake in order to gain a larger multiplier for voting power or
delegation purposes.

### Unlocking a Stake (Cooldown)

If a stake was created with a 'constant' [lockup period](#lockup-period), the ability to 'Unlock'
the position will be visible in the postion as long as the unlock has not yet been initiated. A
constant lockup position will first need to be unlocked before the cooldown period begins.

Unlocking the position will begin the unlocking process. The time this takes will depend on the
duration set during the creation of the position.
