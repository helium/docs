In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking their HNT on-chain for a specified
period in exchange for voting power and subDAO delegation income in the Helium DAO as defined in
HIP-51. After the lock-up period ends, and the locked position is closed the amount of HNT is released
to the owner's wallet and is once again transferable.

veHNT, or voting-escrowed HNT, is a token introduced as part of the Helium Network's transition to
the Solana blockchain and the new governance model. veHNT was designed to empower Helium token
holders by allowing them to participate in the governance of the network and benefit from its
growth. By understanding the veHNT token and the governance model, Helium stakeholders can make
informed decisions and actively participate in shaping the network's future.

## How veHNT Works

When HNT is locked into the voting escrow, it is converted to veHNT, which can be used to
participate in network governance and decision-making. veHNT is the only way to vote in the Helium
Network. The primary purpose of veHNT is to incentivize long-term commitment to the network and
align stakeholders' interests with the network's long-term success. 

veHNT is not a separate token but rather a derivative of HNT. The amount of veHNT received when 
locking HNT depends on the lock-up period chosen by the user, with longer lock-up periods resulting 
in a higher veHNT multiplier.

## SubDAOs

The Helium Network serves as the overarching system that enables a multitude of networks (subDAOs)
to exist via the novel incentive mechanism of HNT.

Each subDAO governs a specific area of the network and receives a portion of the network's token
emissions, distributed proportionaly among veHNT holders who have delegated their veHNT to that 
subDAO. The distribution of tokens is determined by the amount of veHNT delegated to each subDAO 
and the individual lock-up periods. Initially, two subDAOs are introduced: IOT and MOBILE.
Voting on the IOT and MOBILE networks will require veIOT and veMOBILE respectively.

### IOT subDAO

The IOT subDAO focuses on the original vision of the Helium Network, supporting the growth and
development of IoT devices and applications. Delegating veHNT to the IOT subDAO will help fund
projects and initiatives that further the IoT ecosystem on the Helium Network.

### MOBILE subDAO

The MOBILE subDAO is dedicated to the growth and expansion of the Helium Network in the mobile and
telecommunications sectors. Delegating veHNT to the MOBILE subDAO will help finance projects and
initiatives aimed at integrating Helium technology into mobile devices and networks.

## Delegating veHNT

To earn rewards from the token emissions, veHNT holders must delegate their veHNT to one or more 
subDAOs. The lock-up period can range from 1 day to 48 months, with the longer lock-up periods 
resulting  in a higher veHNT multiplier. Users can also change their delegations at any time to 
optimize their earnings from the subDAOs.

veTokens can be managed through [Realms](/vote-escrow/realms) using the in-app browser on the
[Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app):

- [HNT DAO on Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/HNT)
- [IOT subDAO on Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/IOT)
- [MOBILE subDAO on Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/MOBILE)

### Impacts to subDAO Rewards

SubDAO rewards are calculated and paid to the lock-up position each 24hr reward period. At 
approximately 00:30 UTC time. Currently, the IOT and MOBILE subDAO each have a 6% token emission 
pool for veHNT stakers. This 6% is shared proportionaly amongst all veHNT delegated to that 
subDAO at the end of each epoch.

**subDAO rewards may increase when:**

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your treasury gets more HNT. 
- More Hotspot onboarding fees are burned in the subDAO you delegated to.
- More network data is transferred in the subDAO you delegated to.

**subDAO rewards may decrease when:**

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your share is reduced
- More veHNT is delegated to other subDAOs - other treasuries get more HNT.
- Your delegated veHNT decays over time after you enter cooldown (cliff mode)
- More Hotspots are online in other subDAOs that have a non-zero onboarding fee.
- More network data is transferred in other subDAOs.
