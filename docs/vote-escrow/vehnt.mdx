veHNT, or voting-escrowed HNT, is a token introduced as part of the Helium Network's transition to
the Solana blockchain and the new governance model. veHNT was designed to empower Helium token
holders by allowing them to participate in the governance of the network and benefit from its
growth. By understanding the veHNT token and the governance model, Helium stakeholders can make
informed decisions and actively participate in shaping the network's future.

## How veHNT Works

When HNT is locked into the voting escrow, it is converted to veHNT, which can be used to
participate in network governance and decision-making. The primary purpose of veHNT is to
incentivize long-term commitment to the network and align stakeholders' interests with the network's
long-term success.

veHNT is not a separate token but rather a derivative of HNT with its value tied to HNT. The amount
of veHNT received when locking HNT depends on the lock-up period chosen by the user, with longer
lock-up periods resulting in a higher veHNT multiplier.

## SubDAOs

The Helium Network serves as the overarching system that enables a multitude of networks (subDAOs)
to exist via the novel incentive mechanism of HNT.

Each subDAO governs a specific area of the network and receives a portion of the network's token
emissions, distributed among veHNT holders who have delegated their veHNT to that subDAO. The
distribution of tokens is determined by the amount of veHNT delegated to each subDAO and the
individual lock-up periods. Initially, two subDAOs are introduced: IOT and MOBILE.

### IOT subDAO

The IOT subDAO focuses on the original vision of the Helium Network, supporting the growth and
development of IoT devices and applications. Delegating veHNT to the IOT subDAO will help fund
projects and initiatives that further the IoT ecosystem on the Helium Network.

### MOBILE subDAO

The MOBILE subDAO is dedicated to the growth and expansion of the Helium Network in the mobile and
telecommunications sectors. Delegating veHNT to the MOBILE subDAO will help finance projects and
initiatives aimed at integrating Helium technology into mobile devices and networks.

## Delegating veHNT

To participate in subnetwork governance and earn rewards from the token emissions, veHNT holders
must delegate their veHNT to one or both subDAOs. The lock-up period can range from six to 48
months, with longer lock-up periods resulting in a higher veHNT multiplier. Users can also adjust
their delegations at any time to optimize their earnings from the subDAOs.
