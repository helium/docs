In the Helium Ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT positions by locking their HNT on-chain for a
specified period in exchange for voting power and subDAO delegation reward in the Helium DAO. After
the lock-up period ends and the locked position is closed, the amount of HNT is released to the
owner's Wallet and is once again transferable.

veHNT, or voting-escrowed HNT, is a position introduced as part of
[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md). veHNT was designed to empower
Helium Token holders by allowing them to participate in the governance of the Network and benefit
from its growth. By understanding the veHNT token and the governance model, Helium stakeholders can
make informed decisions and actively participate in shaping the Network's future.

## How veHNT Works

When HNT is locked into the voting escrow, it is converted to a veHNT position, which can be used to
participate in Network governance and decision-making. veHNT is the only way to vote in the Helium
Network. The primary purpose of veHNT is to incentivize long-term commitment to the Network and
align stakeholders' interests with the Network's long-term success.

The amount of veHNT received when locking HNT depends on the lock-up period chosen by the user, with
longer lock-up periods resulting in a higher veHNT multiplier.

## SubDAOs

The Helium Network serves as the overarching system that enables a multitude of Networks (subDAOs)
to exist via the HNT token.

Those who delegate their veHNT position to a subDAO are eligible to receive a portion of that
Network's token emissions.

Each subDAO governs a specific area of the Network. The distribution of HNT tokens available to the
subDAO is determined by the amount of veHNT delegated to each subDAO. HNT is minted in proportion to
the veHNT staked to each subDAO. Initially, two subDAOs are introduced: IOT and MOBILE. Voting on
matters specific to the IoT and Mobile networks will require veIOT and veMOBILE respectively.

### IOT subDAO

The IOT subDAO focuses on the original vision of the Helium Network, supporting the growth and
development of IoT devices and applications. Delegating veHNT to the IOT subDAO will help fund
projects and initiatives that further the IoT Ecosystem on the Helium Network.

### MOBILE subDAO

The MOBILE subDAO is dedicated to the growth and expansion of the Helium Network in the cellular
communications sector of the Network. Delegating veHNT to the MOBILE subDAO will help finance
projects and initiatives aimed at integrating Helium technology into mobile devices and Networks.

## Delegating veHNT

To earn rewards from the token emissions, veHNT holders must delegate their position to one or more
subDAOs. The lock-up period can range from 1 day to 48 months, with the longer lock-up periods
resulting in a higher veHNT multiplier. Users can also change their delegations at any time to
optimize their rewards from the subDAOs.

veTokens can be managed through [Realms](/vote-escrow/realms) using the in-app browser on the
[Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app):

- [HNT DAO on Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/HNT)
- [IOT subDAO on Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/IOT)
- [MOBILE subDAO on Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/MOBILE)

### Impacts on subDAO Rewards

SubDAO rewards are calculated and paid to the lock-up position each 24-hour reward period, at
approximately 00:30 UTC. Currently, the IOT and MOBILE subDAO each have a 6% token emission pool for
veHNT stakers. This 6% is shared proportionately amongst all veHNT delegated to that subDAO at the
end of each epoch.

**subDAO rewards may increase when:**

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your treasury gets more HNT.
- More Hotspot onboarding fees are burned in the subDAO you delegated to.
- More Network Data is transferred within the subDAO you delegated to.

**subDAO rewards may decrease when:**

- More veHNT is delegated in the subDAO you delegated to - your share is reduced.
- More veHNT is delegated to other subDAOs - other treasuries get more HNT.
- Your delegated veHNT decays over time after you enter cooldown (cliff mode)
- More Hotspots are online in other subDAOs that have a non-zero onboarding fee.
- More Network Data is transferred within other subDAOs.
