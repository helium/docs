# Helium Hotspot App Overview

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

:::important Sunsetting Features

Wallet-related functionality in the Helium Hotspot app will be sunsetted over the coming months.
This functionality is moving to the new [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app)

:::

The Helium Hotspot App focuses on people who want to send or receive HNT or manage Hotspots. Other
activities, such as managing end-devices and OUIs (i.e. users of the network) are generally best
suited for the command line wallet.

The Helium app (available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hotspot/id1450463605) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet)) includes everything you
need to on-board and maintain your Hotspot and view its activity. With the app, which also is your
Helium wallet, you're able to do things like:

- Send and receive HNT and create Data Credits
- Add your Hotspot to the network and set your location
- Configure your Wi-Fi
- View your Hotspot's activity
- See where other Hotspots are located
