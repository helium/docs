# Deep Links and External QR Codes (e.g. System Camera)

:::info
This page refers to QR codes and deep links that are signed and submitted to the blockchain via the Helium App.
Makers should not use the following information and instead use the [Helium React Native SDK](https://helium.github.io/react-native-helium/modules/WalletLink.html)
to sign and submit transactions in their maker app.
