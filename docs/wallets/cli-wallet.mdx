# Command Line Interface Wallet

The Helium Command Line Interface (CLI) Wallet is the most flexible of the Wallet options but it
also requires more technical knowledge. As such, it is suitable for all types of transactions, but
requires more caution on behalf of its users.

Once you've covered the basics here, you can explore more specific use-cases for the Wallet:

- [add and assert data only hotspot](/iot/data-only-hotspots)

## Installing CLI Wallet

Releases of the CLI Wallet are
[tagged and hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/tags). Click on "Downloads"
for the most recent release and select the appropriate package for your operating system.

Unpack the zip file and place the helium-wallet binary in your `$PATH` somewhere. This operation
differs depending on your operating system but is a common task and easily searchable.

## Usage

At any time, use `--help` to see the most recent documentation and help for the CLI Wallet.

At time of this writing, version 1.7.7 looks like this:

```bash
$ helium-wallet --help
helium-wallet 1.7.7
Common options for most wallet commands

USAGE:
    helium-wallet [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help

    verify        Verify an encypted wallet

```

Exploring the help menu is always a good way to orient yourself. To learn more about a certain
transaction (or subcommand), simply append `--help`. e.g.:

```bash
helium-wallet pay --help
```

This documentation will not cover every single command, but we will provide some basic examples to
help you get familiar.

## Create Wallet

`helium-wallet create basic`

This command will create a Wallet as a single key, stored in `wallet.key` which gets output in
whatever directory you ran this command.

Upon creation, the CLI will prompt you for a password which encrypts the file. A strong password
will make it difficult for someone to brute force the file should the file be compromised.

### Display Wallet

Displaying information for one or more Wallets without needing its password can be done using:

```bash
$ helium-wallet info
```

To display a QR code for the public key of the given Wallet use:

```bash
$ helium-wallet info --qr
```

This is useful for sending tokens to the Wallet from the mobile Wallet.

### Wallet Creation Features

Creating a Wallet above is easy, but there's a lot more flexibility you might not know about. It's
always recommended to explore the help menu to learn more:

```bash
$ helium-wallet create basic --help
helium-wallet-create-basic 1.7.7
Create a new basic wallet

USAGE:
    helium-wallet create basic [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --force      Overwrite an existing file
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --seed       Use a BIP39 or mobile app seed phrase to generate the wallet keys
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --key-type <key-type>    The type of key to generate (ecc_compact/ed25519) [default: ed25519]
        --network <network>      The network to generate the wallet (testnet/mainnet) [default: mainnet]
    -o, --output <output>        Output file to store the key in [default: wallet.key]
        --swarm <swarm>          Import a swarm_key file from a miner, gateway, or other blockchain actor
```

We'll go through a few examples next.

### Managing Multiple Wallets

You can specify a more precise location or filename when _creating a wallet_ by using the `--output`
flag. e.g.:

```bash
$ helium-wallet create basic --output ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key
```

When _using a wallet_, you can specify a file other than the default `./wallet.key` by using the
global option `--file`. e.g.:

```bash
$ helium-wallet -f ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key pay <AMOUNT> <ADDRESS>
```

### Sharded Wallet

Sharding Wallet keys is supported via Shamir's Secret Sharing. A key can be broken into N shards
such that recovering the original key needs K distinct shards. This can be done by passing options
to create:

```bash
$ helium-wallet create sharded -n 5 -k 3
```

This will create wallet.key.1 through wallet.key.5 (the base name of the Wallet file can be supplied
with the `--output` parameter).

When keys are sharded using verify will require at least K distinct keys.

The `--seed` option described above can also be used to construct a sharded Wallet.

#### Implementation details

A ed25519 key is generated via libsodium. The provided password is run through PBKDF2, with a
configurable number of iterations and a random salt, and the resulting value is used as an AES key.
When sharding is enabled, an additional AES key is randomly generated, and the 2 keys are combined
using a sha256 HMAC into the final AES key.

The private key is then encrypted with AES256-GCM and stored in the file along with the sharding
information, the key share (if applicable), the AES initialization vector, the PBKDF2 salt and
iteration count and the AES-GCM authentication tag.

### Import Seed

The `--seed` flag enables you to import a Wallet generated elsewhere. For example, you may want to
import your key from the mobile Wallet, so that you can submit transactions that may not be
supported in the mobile Wallet. The `--seed` command supports seed phrase imports.

Enter the command:

```
$ helium-wallet create basic --seed
```

After you press enter, you will be prompted for your seed words.

:::tip

Remember, your seed is your private key. Keep it safe and **private**. When you import the seed as a
CLI Wallet, you do not "log yourself out" of your mobile Wallet; you've only copied the private key
from your mobile Wallet into the CLI. Mobile wallet and CLI Wallet both have a local copies of the
key and can submit transactions to the blockchain API.

## Export to Helium Wallet App

Helium Wallets created using the CLI can be exported to the Helium Wallet App.

:::note Version Requirements

The `export` feature requires:

- `helium-wallet-rs version 1.7.7` or later, available
  [on GitHub](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/tags)
- [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) version `1.3.0` or later, available for
  [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helium-hnt-wallet/id1609525848) and
  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet.app)

:::

### Export from CLI

Assuming you have already created a CLI Wallet, exporting the Wallet is straight forward. Simply
run:

```bash
$ helium-wallet export
```

You will be prompted for the Wallet Password, (this is _not_ your seed phrase, this password was
input when the Wallet was created.)

Next, you will be prompted to enter an `Export Password` twice. This password will be used in the
Helium Wallet App.

A QR Code will be generated and shown in your terminal.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/cli-wallet/cli-export.png')} />

### Import to Helium Wallet App

Once you have generated a QR code and have your `Export Password` ready, open the Helium Wallet App
and swipe to the `Import` Screen.

## Pay Transaction Example

If you explore the pay command, you will see the following:

```bash
$ helium-wallet pay --help
helium-wallet-pay 1.7.7
Send one (or more) payments to given addresses.

The payment is not submitted to the system unless the '--commit' option is given.

USAGE:
    helium-wallet pay <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help      Prints help information
    -V, --version   Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    multi    Pay multiple payees
    one      Pay a single payee
```

Let's explore the `one` subcommand to figure out usage for a single payment:

```bash
$ helium-wallet pay one --help
helium-wallet-pay-one 1.7.7
Pay a single payee.

Note that HNT only goes to 8 decimals of precision.

USAGE:
    helium-wallet pay one [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <address> <amount> [token]

FLAGS:
        --commit    Commit the payment to the API
    -h, --help      Prints help information
    -V, --version   Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    --fee <fee>         Manually set the DC fee to pay for the transaction
    --memo <memo>       Memo field to include. Provide as a base64 encoded string [default: AAAAAAAAAAA=]
    --nonce <nonce>     Manually set the nonce to use for the transaction

ARGS:
    <address>   Address to send the tokens to
    <amount>    Amount of token to send
    <token>     Type of token to send (hnt, iot, mobile, hst) [default: hnt]
```

The `USAGE` section is very helpful: `helium-wallet pay one [OPTIONS] <address> <amount>`.

For example, if I want to send 5.0 HNT to `14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz5S`, it
will look like this:

```bash
$ helium-wallet pay one 14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz5S 5 --commit
```

The `--commit` FLAG is a global option to the `pay` command - you'll recall it was documented at the
scope of `helium-wallet pay --help`. It's critical for **all transactions** to confirm that you want
the transaction to be submitted to the blockchain API.

When you commit a transaction to the API, you will be provided with a **transaction hash**. This is
a unique identifier for your transaction on the blockchain and you can track your transaction status
using the API endpoint:

```bash
https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/YOUR_HASH_HERE
```

## Transfer Hotspot from 24-word Wallet

If a Hotspot is transferred to a 24-word Wallet, that is ok! However, most Maker Hotspot Management
Apps do not currently support 24-word Wallets.

To transfer a Hotspot from a 24-word Wallet to a 12-word Wallet, follow the steps below.

1. Create a 12-word Wallet to receive the Hotspot using the
   [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) and record the Public Key.

2. Download and install the [Helium Command Line Wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet#installing-cli-wallet)
   as outlined above. and navigate to the installation directory.
3. Import your 24-word seed phrase to the CLI Wallet.

```bash
$ helium-wallet create basic --seed --output my-24-word-wallet.key
```

| argument                         | description                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create basic`                   | create a Wallet with a single key, as opposed to a [sharded wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet#sharded-wallet)          |
| `--seed`.                        | import with an existing seed phrase using the 24-word list.                                                      |
| `--output my-24-word-wallet.key` | output the Wallet key file to a location of your choosing, in this case to a file called `my-24-word-wallet.key` |

4. Find the Gateway ID of the Hotspot to be transferred by running

```bash
$ helium-wallet hotspots list
```

5. Perform a Dry Run of the Hotspot transfer

```bash
$ helium-wallet -f my-24-word-wallet.key hotspots transfer <gateway> <new-owner>
```

| argument                   | description                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f my-24-word-wallet.key` | use a file for the Hotspot Wallet, in this case `my-24-word-wallet.key` |
| `hotspots transfer`        | run a Hotspot transfer                                                  |
| `<gateway>`                | the gateway id you collected from Step 4 above                          |
| `<new-owner>`              | the public Wallet Address to receive the Hotspot                        |

6. The above will do a test try and have an output you should verify.

7. Now it's time to run it for real.

:::danger Point of No Return

Including the `--commit` flag submits the transfer transaction to the blockchain.

**There is no going back from this** so please take your time and double-check your inputs.

:::

```bash
$ helium-wallet -f my-24-word-wallet.key hotspots transfer <gateway> <new-owner> --commit
```

8. Once the transfer transaction is validated by the blockchain, your Hotspot will appear in the new
   12-word Wallet.
