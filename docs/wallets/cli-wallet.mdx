# Command Line Interface Wallet

## Installing CLI Wallet

### Running From a Release

Releases of the CLI Wallet are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/releases). Select the appropriate
package for your operating system.

Unpack the zip file and place the helium-wallet binary in your `$PATH`. This operation differs
depending on your operating system but is a common task and easily searchable.

### Building From Source

The Helium Wallet CLI is open-source, written in Rust, and can be compiled with appropriate tooling.
For build instructions, see the
[Building from Source](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs#building-from-source) section on
the helium‑wallet‑rs GitHub repo.

## Usage

At any time, use `--help` to see the most recent in-program documentation.

At the time of this writing, version 2.0.0-rc.3 looks like this:

```sh
./helium-wallet --help
Common options for most wallet commands

Usage: helium-wallet [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  info      Get wallet information
  balance   Get the balance for a wallet or a given public key. The balance is given for each of the Helium related holdings of a given Solana address
  upgrade   Upgrade a wallet to the latest supported version of the given format. The same password is used to decrypt the old and encrypt the new wallet
  router    Operations on routers
  create    Create a new wallet or keypair
  hotspots  Commands on hotspots
  dc        Commands on data credits
  transfer  Send one (or more) payments to given addresses
  export    Exports encrypted wallet seed as QR-encoded JSON or raw seed via stdout
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -f, --file <FILES>  File(s) to use [default: wallet.key]
      --url <URL>     Solana RPC URL to use [default: m]
  -h, --help          Print help
  -V, --version       Print version
```

Exploring the help menu is always a good way to orient yourself. To learn more about a certain
transaction (or subcommand), simply append `--help`. e.g.:

```sh
./helium-wallet dc --help
Commands on data credits

Usage: helium-wallet dc <COMMAND>

Commands:
  price     Get the amount of HNT needed to buy a given number of USD worth of Data Credits
  mint      Burn HNT to Data Credits (DC) from this wallet to given payees wallet
  delegate  Delegate DC from this wallet to a given router
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

## Basic Commands

### Create Wallet

`helium-wallet create basic`

This command will create an account as a single key, stored in `wallet.key` which gets output in the
same directory where the command is run.

Upon creation, the CLI will prompt you for a password that encrypts the file. A strong password will
make it difficult for someone to brute force the file should the file be compromised.

### Display Wallet

Displaying information for an account without needing its password can be done using:

```bash
$ helium-wallet info
```

To display a QR code for the public key of the given Wallet use:

```bash
$ helium-wallet info --qr
```

The QR Code is useful for sending tokens to the account from a wallet app.

### Wallet Creation Features

Creating a Wallet above is easy, but there's a lot more flexibility you might not know about. It's
always recommended to explore the help menu to learn more:

```bash
$ helium-wallet create basic --help
Create a new basic wallet

Usage: helium-wallet create basic [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>  Output file to store the key in [default: wallet.key]
      --force            Overwrite an existing file
      --seed             Use a BIP39 or mobile app seed phrase to generate the wallet keys
  -h, --help             Print help
```

### Managing Multiple Accounts

A more precise location or filename can be specified when creating an account by using the
`--output` flag. e.g.:

```bash
$ helium-wallet create basic --output ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key
```

You can specify a file other than the default `./wallet.key` by using the global option `--file`.
e.g.:

```bash
$ helium-wallet -f ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key transfer <AMOUNT> <ADDRESS> <TOKEN>
```

### Import Seed-phrase Account into CLI

The `--seed` flag enables you to import an account secured by a 12 or 24-word seed phrase.

Enter the command:

```
$ helium-wallet create basic --seed
```

After you press enter, you will be prompted for your seed words, separated by spaces.

### Export to Helium Wallet App

Helium Wallets created using the CLI can be exported to the Helium Wallet App.

```bash
$ helium-wallet export
```

You will be prompted for the Wallet Password, (this is _not_ your seed phrase, this password was
input when the Wallet was created.)

The `export` command will display the seed phrase associated with the given account. This seed
phrase can be used with the Helium Wallet App or other Solana ecosystem wallets.
