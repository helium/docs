# Command Line Interface Wallet

The Helium Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet is the most flexible of the wallet options but it
also requires more technical knowledge. As such, it is suitable for all types of transactions, but
requires more caution on behalf of its users.

Once you've covered the basics here, you can explore more specific use-cases for the wallet:

- [add and assert data only hotspot](/mine-hnt/data-only-hotspots)
- [add validator](/mine-hnt/validators/mainnet/deployment-guide#stake-hnt-to-your-validator)

## Installing CLI Wallet

Releases of the CLI wallet are
[tagged and hosted on Github](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/tags). Click on "Downloads"
for the most recent release and select the appropriate package for your operating system.

Unpack the zip file and place the helium-wallet binary in your `$PATH` somewhere. This operation
differs depending on your operating system, but is a common task and easily searchable.

## Usage

At any time, use `--help` to see the most recent documentation and help for the CLI wallet.

At time of this writing, version 1.6.0 looks like this:

```
$ helium-wallet --help
helium-wallet 1.6.0

```

Exploring the help menu is always a good way to orient yourself. To learn more about a certain
transaction (or subcommand), simply append `--help`. eg:

```
helium-wallet pay --help
```

This documentation will not cover every single command, but we will provide some basic examples to
help you get familiar.

## Create Wallet

`helium-wallet create basic`

This command will create a wallet as a single key, stored in `wallet.key` which gets output in
whatever directory you ran this command.

Upon creation, the CLI will prompt you for a password which encrypts the file. A strong password
will make it difficult for someone to brute force the file should the file be compromised.

### Display Wallet

Displaying information for one or more wallets without needing its password can be done using;

```
    helium-wallet info
```

To display a QR code for the public key of the given wallet use:

```
    helium-wallet info --qr
```

This is useful for sending tokens to the wallet from the mobile wallet.

### Wallet Creation Features

Creating a wallet above is easy, but there's a lot more flexibility you might not know about. It's
always recommended to explore the help menu to learn more:

```
$ helium-wallet create basic --help

helium-wallet-create-basic 1.6.0
Create a new basic wallet

USAGE:
    helium-wallet create basic [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --force      Overwrite an existing file
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --key-type <key-type>    The type of key to generate (ecc_compact/ed25519) [default: ed25519]
        --network <network>      The network to generate the wallet (testnet/mainnet) [default: mainnet]
    -o, --output <output>        Output file to store the key in [default: wallet.key]
        --seed <seed>            Use a BIP39 or mobile app seed phrase to generate the wallet keys [possible values:
                                 bip39, mobile]
```

We'll go through a few examples next.

### Managing Multiple Wallets

You can specify a more precise location or filename when _creating a wallet_ by using the `--output`
flag. eg:

`helium-wallet create basic --output ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key`

When _using a wallet_, you can specify a file other than the default `./wallet.key` by using the the
global option `--file`. eg:

`helium-wallet -f ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key pay <AMOUNT> <ADDRESS>`

### Sharded Wallet

Sharding wallet keys is supported via Shamir's Secret Sharing. A key can be broken into N shards
such that recovering the original key needs K distinct shards. This can be done by passing options
to create:

```
    helium-wallet create sharded -n 5 -k 3
```

This will create wallet.key.1 through wallet.key.5 (the base name of the wallet file can be supplied
with the `--output` parameter).

When keys are sharded using verify will require at least K distinct keys.

The `--seed` option described above can also be used to construct a sharded wallet.

#### Implementation details

A ed25519 key is generated via libsodium. The provided password is run through PBKDF2, with a
configurable number of iterations and a random salt, and the resulting value is used as an AES key.
When sharding is enabled, an additional AES key is randomly generated and the 2 keys are combined
using a sha256 HMAC into the final AES key.

The private key is then encrypted with AES256-GCM and stored in the file along with the sharding
information, the key share (if applicable), the AES initialization vector, the PBKDF2 salt and
iteration count and the AES-GCM authentication tag.

### Import Seed

The `--seed` flag enables you to import a wallet generated elsewhere. For example, you may want to
import you key from the mobile wallet, so that you can submit transactions that may not be supported
in the mobile wallet.

Enter the command:

```
$ helium-wallet create basic --seed mobile
```

After you press enter, you will be prompted for your seed words.

:::tip

Remember, your seed is your private key. Keep it safe and **private**. When you import the seed as a
CLI wallet, you do not "log yourself out" of your mobile wallet; you've only copied the private key
from your mobile wallet into the CLI. Mobile wallet and CLI wallet both have a local copies of the
key and can submit transactions to the blockchain API.

## Pay Transaction Example

If you explore the pay command, you will see the following:

```
$ helium-wallet pay --help

helium-wallet-pay 1.6.0
Send one (or more) payments to given addresses.

The payment is not submitted to the system unless the '--commit' option is given.

USAGE:
helium-wallet pay [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    --commit
        Commit the payment to the API
    -h, --help
        Prints help information
    -V, --version
        Prints version information

[..]

SUBCOMMANDS:
help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
multi    Multiple payees (requires file input). Check "helium-wallet pay multi --help" for details
one      Single payee
```

Let's explore the `one` subcommand to figure out usage for a single payment:

```
$ helium-wallet pay one --help

helium-wallet-pay-one 1.6.0
Single payee

USAGE:
    helium-wallet pay one [OPTIONS] <address> <amount>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --memo <memo>    Memo field to include. Provide as a base64 encoded string [default: AAAAAAAAAAA=]

ARGS:
    <address>    Address to send the tokens to
    <amount>     Amount of HNT to send
```

The `USAGE` section is is very helpful: `helium-wallet pay one [OPTIONS] <address> <amount>`.

For example, if I want to send 5.0 HNT to `14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz5S`, it
would look like this:

```
helium-wallet pay one 14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz5S 5 --commit
```

The `--commit` FLAG is a global option to the `pay` command - you'll recall it was documented at the
scope of `helium-wallet pay --help`. It's critical for **all transactions** to confirm that you want
the transaction to be submitted to the blockchain API.

When you commit a transaction to the API, you will be provided with a **transaction hash**. This is
a unique identifier for your transaction on the blockchain and you can track your transcation status
using the API endpoint:

```
https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/YOUR_HASH_HERE
```

## Transfer Hotspot from 24-word Wallet

If a Hotspot is transferred to a 24-word wallet, that is ok! However, most Maker Hotspot Management
Apps do not currently support 24-word wallets.

To transfer a Hotspot from a 24-word wallet to a 12-word wallet, follow the steps below.

1. Create a 12-word wallet to receive the Hotspot using the
   [Helium Hotspot App](/wallets/app-wallet) and record the Public Key.

2. Download and install the [Helium Command Line Wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet#installing-cli-wallet)
   as outlined above. and navigate to the installation directory.
3. Import your 24-word seed phrase to the CLI Wallet.

```bash
./helium-wallet create basic --seed bip39 --output my-24-word-wallet.key
```

| argument                         | description                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create basic`                   | create a wallet with a single key, as opposed to a [sharded wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet#sharded-wallet)          |
| `--seed bip39`                   | import with an existing seed phrase using the `bip39` word list                                                  |
| `--output my-24-word-wallet.key` | output the wallet key file to a location of your choosing, in this case to a file called `my-24-word-wallet.key` |

4. Find the Gateway ID of the Hotspot to be transferred by running

```bash
./helium-wallet hotspots list
```

5. Perform a Dry Run of the Hotspot transfer

```bash
./helium-wallet -f my-24-word-wallet.key hotspots transfer <gateway> <new-owner>
```

| argument                   | description                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f my-24-word-wallet.key` | use a file for the hotspot wallet, in this case `my-24-word-wallet.key` |
| `hotspots transfer`        | run a hotspot transfer                                                  |
| `<gateway>`                | the gateway id you collected from Step 4 above                          |
| `<new-owner>`              | the public Wallet Address to receive the Hotspot                        |

6. The above will do a test try and have an output you should verify.

7. Now it's time to run it for real.

:::danger Point of No Return

Including the `--commit` flag submits the transfer transaction to the blockchain.

**There is no going back from this** so please take your time and double-check your inputs.

:::

```bash
./helium-wallet -f my-24-word-wallet.key hotspots transfer <gateway> <new-owner> --commit
```

8. Once the transfer transaction is validated by the blockchain, your Hotspot will appear in the new
   12-word wallet.
