# Command Line Interface Wallet

The Command Line Interface (CLI) The Helium Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet
is the most flexible but it also requires more technical knowledge. As such, it
is suitable for all types of transactions, but requires more caution on behalf
of its users.

## Installing CLI Wallet

Releases of the CLI wallet are [tagged and hosted on Github](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/tags).

Exploring the help menu is always a good way to orient yourself. To learn more
about a certain transaction (or subcommand), simply append `--help`. eg:

```
helium-wallet pay --help
```

This documentation will not cover every single command, but we will provide some basic examples
to help you get familiar.

## Create Wallet

`helium-wallet create basic`

This command will create a wallet as a single key, stored in `wallet.key` which gets output
in whatever directory you ran this command.

Upon creation, the CLI will prompt you for a password which encrypts the file. A strong password
will make it difficult for someone to brute force the file should the file be compromised.

## Pay




## Specifying wallets

You can specify a more precise location or filename when _creating a wallet_ by using the
`--output` flag. eg:

`helium-wallet create basic --output ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key`

When _using a wallet_, you can specify a file other than the default `./wallet.key` by using
the the global option `--file`. eg:

`helium-wallet -f ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key pay <AMOUNT> <ADDRESS>`
