# Command Line Interface Wallet

The Command Line Interface (CLI) The Helium Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet
is the most flexible but it also requires more technical knowledge. As such, it
is suitable for all types of transactions, but requires more caution on behalf
of its users.

## Installing CLI Wallet

Releases of the CLI wallet are [tagged and hosted on Github](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs/tags).
Click on "Downloads" for the most recent release and select the appropriate
package for your operating system.

Unpack the zip file and place the helium-wallet binary in your $PATH somewhere.
This operation differs depending on your operating system, but is a common
task and easily searchable.

## Usage

At any time, use `--help` to see the most recent documentation and help for the
CLI wallet.

At time of this writing, version 1.5.4 looks like this:

```

```

Exploring the help menu is always a good way to orient yourself. To learn more
about a certain transaction (or subcommand), simply append `--help`. eg:

```
helium-wallet pay --help
```

This documentation will not cover every single command, but we will provide some basic examples
to help you get familiar.

## Create Wallet

`helium-wallet create basic`

This command will create a wallet as a single key, stored in `wallet.key` which gets output
in whatever directory you ran this command.

Upon creation, the CLI will prompt you for a password which encrypts the file. A strong password
will make it difficult for someone to brute force the file should the file be compromised.

### Discovering Features with the Help Menu

Creating a wallet above is easy, but there's a lot more flexibility you might not know about. It's
always recommended to explore the help menu to learn more:

```
$ helium-wallet create basic --help

helium-wallet-create-basic 1.5.6
Create a new basic wallet

USAGE:
    helium-wallet create basic [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --force      Overwrite an existing file
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --key-type <key-type>    The type of key to generate (ecc_compact/ed25519) [default: ed25519]
        --network <network>      The network to generate the wallet (testnet/mainnet) [default: mainnet]
    -o, --output <output>        Output file to store the key in [default: wallet.key]
        --seed <seed>            Use a BIP39 or mobile app seed phrase to generate the wallet keys [possible values:
                                 bip39, mobile]
```

You can see there's a lot more you can do with this command. Let's try a few out.

### Managing Multiple Wallets

You can specify a more precise location or filename when _creating a wallet_ by using the
`--output` flag. eg:

`helium-wallet create basic --output ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key`

When _using a wallet_, you can specify a file other than the default `./wallet.key` by using
the the global option `--file`. eg:

`helium-wallet -f ~/my-wallets/wallet-5.key pay <AMOUNT> <ADDRESS>`

## Pay Transaction Example

If you explore the pay command, you will see the following:

```
$ helium-wallet pay --help

helium-wallet-pay 1.5.6
Send one (or more) payments to given addresses.

The payment is not submitted to the system unless the '--commit' option is given.

USAGE:
helium-wallet pay [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    --commit
        Commit the payment to the API
    -h, --help
        Prints help information
    -V, --version
        Prints version information

[..]

SUBCOMMANDS:
help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
multi    Multiple payees (requires file input). Check "helium-wallet pay multi --help" for details
one      Single payee
```

Let's explore the `one` subcommand to figure out usage for a single payment:

```
$ helium-wallet pay one --help

helium-wallet-pay-one 1.5.6
Single payee

USAGE:
    helium-wallet pay one [OPTIONS] <address> <amount>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --memo <memo>    Memo field to include. Provide as a base64 encoded string [default: AAAAAAAAAAA=]

ARGS:
    <address>    Address to send the tokens to
    <amount>     Amount of HNT to send
```

The `USAGE` section is is very helpful: `helium-wallet pay one [OPTIONS] <address> <amount>`.

For example, if I want to send 5.0 HNT to `14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz5S`,
it would look like this:

```
helium-wallet pay one 14GWyFj9FjLHzoN3aX7Tq7PL6fEg4dfWPY8CrK8b9S5ZrcKDz5S 5 --commit
```

The `--commit` FLAG is a global option to the `pay` command - you'll recall it was documented at the
scope of `helium-wallet pay --help`. It's critical for **all transactions** to confirm that you want
the transaction to be submitted to the blockchain API.

When you commit a transaction to the API, you will be provided with a **transaction hash**. This is
a unique identifier for your transaction on the blockchain and you can track your transcation status
using the API endpoint:

```
https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/YOUR_HASH_HERE
```
