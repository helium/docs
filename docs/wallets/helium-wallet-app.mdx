# Helium Wallet App

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/header.png')} />

The Helium Wallet app is the new trusted way to manage your tokens and identity on the Helium
Blockchain. This new Wallet App is not meant to manage Hotspots or Validators.

All Hotspot Management (diagnostics, asserting location, adding Hotspots, etc) should be done via
the [Maker Apps](/mine-hnt/maker-apps) available from the manufacturer.

## Wallets and Accounts

### Importing An Existing Wallet

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/import-account-banner.png')}
/>

If you have an existing Helium wallet, either one created from the original Helium app or using CLI,
you can import it into the Wallet app.

|  Account Type   | Action                                                                                |
| :-------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 12-words wallet | Tap the 12 Words button and enter in the 12-words seed phrase, in the original order. |
| 24-words wallet | Tap the 24 Words button and enter in the 24-words seed phrase, in the original order. |
|     Ledger      | Tap the Ledger option and follow the in-app prompts to pair with the hardware wallet. |

### Creating A New Wallet

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/new-account-banner.png')}
/>

Wallets created with the Helium Wallet app are generated with a 24-words seed phrase. These 24 words
in correct order are the only way to access the wallet, and can never be recovered if lost. **They
should never be shared**, as whoever has them is considered the owner of the HNT included. Anyone
asking for them is guaranteed to be a scammer.

**Taking and storing screenshots of the seed words is not recommended, as it is not a** secure way
to store them. Screenshots and photos stored or backed up in the cloud can easily be hacked and
funds stolen.

### Ledger Wallet

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/pair-ledger-banner.png')}
/>

Import your Ledger account by pairing with it over Bluetooth. Payment and other transaction support
will be coming soon.

## Working With Multiple Wallets

You are able to create/import multiple wallets, each with their unique set of 12 or 24 words. You
can move between wallets by swiping left/right on the wallet name at the top of the screen. When you
tap on Settings, they will be for the selected wallet.

:::info How Many Wallets?

There is a limit of 10 wallet accounts (testnet + mainnet combined) per install.

## Send And Request Tokens

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/send-request-banner.png')}
/>

The Blue Send button allows you to choose the imported wallet you wish to send from, and choose a
Contact you wish to send HNT to.

The Green Request button allows you to quickly generate a QR code for someone to scan (which
provides your wallet address), or generate a link to share via email or text. You can also enter in
the amount you are requesting, if it is a known quantity, and add a note.

### Multiple Recipient Payment Support

Already available on the CLI wallet, multiple recipient payments are now supported on the Wallet
app. This is most useful for those that need to wait for a payment transaction to clear and appear
on the blockchain before sending the next payment.

:::tip

You can create your own [QR codes](/wallets/app-wallet/deep-links-and-qr-codes/) to scan, which can
include an address/alias to send payment to.

The new payment type supported in the Helium Wallet app can have multiple payees which can also be
included in a QR code.

You can also form a Burn transaction in QR Code format.

## Voting

<img

  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/vote-banner.png')}
/>

When HIPs (Helium Improvement Proposals) are being voted on, you can quickly and easily vote for or
against any Active votes. Tapping on Closed Votes shows a historical record of past HIPs and how the
vote was decided.

## Helium Identity

Use the new Wallet app to connect to various dApps like Crowdspot and authenticate your identity on
the Helium blockchain.
