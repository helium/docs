The Helium Wallet app is the trusted way to manage your Helium account.  
Some notable features:

- Multiple account support (maximum of 10)

- Verify your Helium identity
- Lock-up tokens for voting power and staking rewards
- Multiple recipient payment support
- Claiming tokens from Hotspots to your account
- Transfer NFTs representing Hotspot ownership

- Updating the location of a Hotspot

Hotspot management should be done via the [Maker App](/hotspot-makers) available from the
manufacturer.  
See Hotspot manufacturer apps for features like:

- Hotspot settings like WiFi credentials

## A Note On Account Safety

Before proceeding, a few general notes on how to be safe in web3. An account is entirely your own.
No third party – including Helium – can recover or access an account. As such, it is critical that
the 12 or 24-word seed phrase be stored in a **secure manner** and **never be shared**. Taking and
storing screenshots of the seed words is not recommended, as it is not a secure way to store them.
Screenshots and photos stored or backed up in the cloud are an easy target for attackers, leading to
funds being stolen.

The point cannot be emphasized enough:  
**Securely store and never share the 12 or 24-word seed phrase.**

Anyone asking for your 12 or 24-word seed phrase is **guaranteed to be a scammer**. If you fail to
keep your seed phrase secure or if you share your seed phrase with anybody, all of your tokens,
Hotspots, or NFTs will be **stolen** and will never be able to be recovered!

Additionally, beware of lookalike websites or apps seeking to offer help, support, airdrops, or
other features. Do not share private keys or authenticate transactions through untrusted platforms.

## Accounts

### Creating A New Account

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/new-account-banner.png')}
/>

Accounts created with the Helium Wallet app are generated with a 24-word seed phrase. These 24 words
in the correct order are the **only** way to access the account and can **never** be recovered if
lost. Whomever has the 24-word seed phrase controls the wallet, meaning that they are considered the
owner of all tokens, Hotspots, or NFTs in the account.

### Importing An Existing Account

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/import-account-banner.png')}
/>

If you have an existing Helium account you can import it into the Helium Wallet app.

|    Account Type     | Action                                                                                |
| :-----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 12-word seed phrase | Tap the `12 Word` button and enter the 12-word seed phrase, in the original order.    |
| 24-word seed phrase | Tap the `24 Word` button and enter the 24-word seed phrase, in the original order.    |
|       Ledger        | Tap the Ledger option and follow the in-app prompts to pair with the hardware wallet. |

## Working With Multiple Accounts

The Helium Wallet App supports creating or importing up to 10 accounts, each with its own unique set
of 12 or 24 words. Navigate between accounts by pressing on the account name at the top of the
screen. An account selector allows toggling between different onboarded accounts. The settings
screen will apply to the selected account.

## Tokens Supported

The Helium Wallet will display the token balances and fiat value in your account for:

**HNT** - in USD or your defined currency  
**MOBILE** - in USD or your defined currency  
**IOT**- in USD or your defined currency  
**DC**- in USD (Not transferable)  
**SOL**- in USD or your defined currency

No other tokens held in your account will be displayed in the Helium Wallet App.

The green request button allows you to quickly generate a QR code of your account's public address
for someone to scan or generate a link to share via email or text. You can also enter the amount you
are requesting or add a note.

## Helium Identity

Use the Helium Wallet app to connect to dApps and authenticate your identity on the Solana
blockchain. Using the in-app browser, access dApps like Jupiter Aggregator or
[stake and vote your tokens using Realms](/governance/realms).

## Address Book And Contacts

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/address-book-banner.png')}
/>

This feature allows you to save names/nicknames and related account addresses for accounts you may
wish to send tokens to. Contacts are displayed in alphabetical order and are searchable by name or
account address. There is no limit to the number of contacts you can have.

Tapping on a contact displays the public address as well as the Nickname field, which can be
adjusted at any time.

## Settings

### Wallet Account Settings

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/settings-wallet-account-banner.png')}
/>

Each account imported to the Helium Wallet app has separate settings.

|     Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| :-------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Account Alias  | Give your account a name to help separate it from other accounts managed in the Helium Wallet App.                                                 |
| Default Account | When using multiple accounts, this toggle will determine which one is the default and will show first whenever the Helium Wallet app is opened.    |
|  Copy Address   | Copies the account address to your device's clipboard.                                                                                             |
|  Share Address  | Provides QR code so someone can scan your account's public address or allows you to quickly share it via email or text.                            |
|  Remove Wallet  | Logs you out of the current account. The original seed phrase is required to ensure the words are safely backed up since they cannot be recovered. |

### Hotspots Wallet Backup

If someone has your private key, they will have full control of your account. This includes the
ability to remove tokens and Hotspots.  
Do not enter these words into any untrusted website. Any person or website asking for these keys is
likely a scammer.

|      Setting       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Reveal Words    | While logged in, you can view your 12-word or 24-word seed phrase. These are required for login/logout of an account and can never be recovered if lost. Lose these, lose the Wallet and everything it contains. Back them up in a secure place. |
| Reveal Private Key | The private key of your account can be used to import the account into other Solana-compatible wallet apps like Solflare, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, or Backpack.                                                                                 |

## 12-Word And 24-Word Seed Phrases

When a Helium account is created with the Helium Wallet app, a 24-word "Seed Phrase" is generated.

Users who created their Helium account using the Helium Hotspot app will have a 12-word seed phrase.
While the Helium Wallet app accepts 12-word seed phrases, all new Helium Wallets are created with
24-word seed phrases.

Read more about Helium Wallet [seed phrases here](/wallets/wallet-seed-phrase).

:::caution Before Deleting Helium Wallet Apps

Do not uninstall the Helium Wallet app without first writing down the seed phrase.
