The Helium Wallet app is the trusted way to manage your Helium Tokens and identity.

Some notable features:

- Multiple Account Support (maximum of 10)
- Ledger Balance
- Address Book
- Verify your Helium Identity
- Lock-up tokens for voting power and staking rewards
- Voting on Governance
- Multiple Recipient Payment Support
- Claiming tokens from Hotspots to your Wallet
- Transfer NFTs representing Hotspot ownership
- Exchange one Helium Token for another or SOL

All Hotspot Management (diagnostics, asserting location, adding Hotspots, etc) should be done via
the [Maker App](/hotspot-makers) available from the manufacturer.

## Wallets and Accounts

### Importing An Existing Wallet

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/import-account-banner.png')}
/>

If you have an existing Helium Wallet, either one created from the original Helium Hotspot App or
using CLI, you can import it into the Helium Wallet app.

|  Account Type  | Action                                                                                |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 12-word wallet | Tap the `12 Word` button and enter in the 12-word seed phrase, in the original order. |
| 24-word wallet | Tap the `24 Word` button and enter in the 24-word seed phrase, in the original order. |
|     Ledger     | Tap the Ledger option and follow the in-app prompts to pair with the hardware wallet. |

### Creating A New Wallet

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/new-account-banner.png')}
/>

Wallets created with the Helium Wallet app are generated with a 24-word seed phrase. These 24 words
in the correct order are the **ONLY** way to access the Wallet and can never be recovered if lost.
**They should never be shared**, as whoever has them is considered the owner of all Tokens,
Hotspots, or NFTs. Anyone asking for them is guaranteed to be a scammer.

**Taking and storing screenshots of the seed words is not recommended, as it is not a** secure way
to store them. Screenshots and photos stored or backed up in the cloud can easily be hacked and
funds stolen.

## Working With Multiple Wallets

You are able to create/import multiple Wallets, each with their unique set of 12 or 24 words. You
can move between Wallets by pressing on the Wallet name at the top of the screen. A pop-up screen
with the multiple Wallet names shows up and choose the Wallet name you need. When you tap on
Settings, they will be for the selected Wallet.

:::info How Many Wallets?

There is a limit of 10 Wallet accounts (testnet + mainnet combined) per install.

:::

## Tokens Supported

The Helium Wallet will display the quantity in your Wallet and price for:

HNT - in USD or your defined currency MOBILE - in USD or your defined currency IOT- in USD or your
defined currency DC- in USD (Not transferable) SOL- in USD or your defined currency

No other tokens held in your Wallet will be displayed, the value of other tokens will not be shown.

## Send And Request Tokens

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/send-request-banner.png')}
/>

The Blue Send button allows you to choose the imported Wallet you wish to send from, and choose a
Contact you wish to send HNT to.

The Green Request button allows you to quickly generate a QR code for someone to scan (which
provides your Wallet address) or generate a link to share via email or text. You can also enter in
the amount you are requesting, if it is a known quantity, and add a note.

### Multiple Recipient Payment Support

Multiple recipient payments are now supported on the Helium Wallet app. This is most useful for
those that need to wait for a payment transaction to clear and appear on the blockchain before
sending the next payment.

:::tip

You can create your own [QR codes](/deep-links-and-qr-codes) to scan, which can include an
address/alias to send payment to.

The new payment type supported in the Helium Wallet app can have multiple payees which can also be
included in a QR code.

You can also form a Burn transaction in QR Code format.

:::

## Voting

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/vote-banner.png')}
/>

When HIPs (Helium Improvement Proposals) are being voted on, you can quickly and easily vote for or
against any Active votes. Tapping on Closed Votes shows a historical record of past HIPs and how the
vote was decided.

## Helium Identity

Use the new Helium Wallet app to connect to various dApps like Crowdspot and authenticate your
identity on the Helium blockchain.

## Transaction Filters

Tapping on a Contact displays the full Helium or Solana address as well as the Nickname field, which
can be adjusted at any time.

## Settings

### Wallet Account Settings

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/settings-wallet-account-banner.png')}
/>

Each Account imported to the Helium Wallet app has separate settings.

|     Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Account Alias  | You can rename the Wallet here for organization (does not affect your Wallet address or HNT)                                                                                                                   |
| Default Account | When using multiple Wallets, this toggle will determine which one is the default and will show first whenever the Helium Wallet app is opened.                                                                 |
|  Reveal Words   | While logged in, you can view your 12-word or 24-word seed phrase. These are required for login/logout of a Wallet and can never be recovered if lost. Lose these, lose the Wallet and everything it contains. |
|  Copy Address   | Copies the Wallet address to your device's clipboard                                                                                                                                                           |
|  Share Address  | Provides QR code so someone can scan your Wallet address and allows you to quick share it via email or text.                                                                                                   |
|    Sign Out     | logs you out of the current wallet. The original 12-word or 24-word seed phrase is required, to ensure the words are safely backed up since they cannot be recovered.                                          |

### Security Settings

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"

/>

These Settings keep the Helium Wallet app secure.

|         Setting          | Description                                                                                        |

|        Reset PIN         | Change the current PIN to a new one (original PIN is required to update this)                      |
| Require PIN for Payments | This additional security option requires the PIN to be entered before any HNT payment can be sent. |

### App Settings

<img
  className="appscreenbanner"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/wallets/helium-wallet-app/settings-app-banner.png')}
/>

The Helium Wallet app has interface settings that can be adjusted to your liking.

|       Setting       | Description                                                             |

|     App Version     | Notes the version of the app that is installed                          |

### Developer Settings

Developer settings should be used intentionally. If you are not a Developer, or not sure what these
settings do, it is best to leave them `off` by default.

|    Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable Testnet | Testnet is typically for developers. It allows you to create a test account and get TNT (which holds zero monetary value), which can be used to test apps and transactions without burning real HNT. When toggled on, you create a testnet specific account. |

### Examine Hotspots

You can now examine your Hotspots by clicking the Collectables Tab.

Let us know via Discord if you experience any issues!

### Ledger Wallet

Hardware Ledgers are not yet compatible with the Helium Wallet app on the Solana blockchain. Current
advice is to migrate using the tool mentioned below and switch to using
[Solflare](https://solflare.com/).

See [Ledger Wallet migration guide](/solana/migration/ledger) for guidance on how to migrate Ledger
Wallets to Solana.

See [Ledger Wallet Hardware](/wallets/ledger-wallet) for how a Ledger wallet was configured for HNT
on the Helium blockchain.
