# Ledger Hardware Wallet

The Helium tokens have support for Ledger Hardware Wallets via the Solana blockchain. Ledger allows
for:

- Viewing account address(es) and balances
- Transferring tokens
- Signing transactions

At this time, Hotspot management actions such as onboarding or asserting location are not supported.
You will need to perform these actions within the
[Helium Wallet App.](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/helium-wallet-app)

Helium HNT, MOBILE and IOT are Solana SPL tokens and are supported by the Solana App for Ledger but
not directly in Ledger Live.

Installation instructions for the Solana App are on
[Ledger Solana support page.](https://support.ledger.com/article/360016265659-zd) Remember to
configure [blind signing.](https://support.ledger.com/article/4499092909085-zd)

    :::

12. In desktop Ledger Live window go to settings -> Developer Mode -> Enable
13. In desktop Ledger Live window, find Solana App and click install
14. On Ledger Device start Solana app by clicking both buttons
15. On Ledger Device navigate to Settings in Solana App and enable "Allow Blind Signing"

    wallet.

## Testing your Ledger Cold Wallet

Before making any significant transfers into your new Ledger wallet, it is best to make a series of
test transfers in and out of your wallet.

1. Open the Helium Black Wallet App on your smartphone
2. Navigate to your Ledger Wallet from steps above
3. Copy the pub key of your Ledger Wallet
4. Make a test transfer of SOL into your new Ledger Wallet  
   :::tip

   Transfers out of your wallet will require SOL to pay fees, so start by adding at little SOL e.g.
   0.1 SOL to your wallet.

   :::

5. Copy the pub key of an external wallet (either Coinbase or other Black Wallet App native wallet)
6. Make a test transfer of SOL out of your new Ledger Wallet  
   :::note

   This will require your Ledger to be PIN unlocked and Solana App started and "ready" to complete

   :::

7. Review and Approve the transaction on your Ledger Device when prompted
8. Repeat the Process with HNT or IOT again with small amounts
9. After your have tested transfers in and out of your Ledger wallet, you are ready for safe cold
   storage using your Ledger Wallet.

## Using Third Party Wallet Apps

Users may alternatively use Solflare or Phantom to
[access SOL/SPL tokens with Ledger.](https://support.ledger.com/article/7723954701469-zd)

Solflare, Phantom and other non-custodial wallets can import the private key from the Helium Wallet
App. Follow the instructions on our using
[Third Party Wallets](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/third-party-wallets#importing-helium-accounts-into-solana-wallets)
documentation.

## Ledger Helium L1 to Solana Migration

If you have an unmigrated Ledger wallet that existed on the Helium L1 prior to the migration to
Solana on April 18th, 2023, you will need to follow these instructions.

:::note Outdated Ledger Issues

It has been many years since the Solana migration. Since then, Ledger has made changes that can
cause this migration tool to no longer work, such as dropping support for the Nano S.

If the migration tool does not work for you, the best option is to import the seed phrase from your
Ledger into the official [Helium Wallet App](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/helium-wallet-app). You
can then transfer your tokens from the app to a new hardware wallet with a new seed phrase.

### Installing the Helium-Solana App

Update your Ledger firmware to at least 2.1.0, preferably 2.4.x before you start.

As of now, we are still waiting on Ledger to release our app. Until then, to install you must follow
these steps:

1. Open Ledger Live.
2. Go to Settings (top right corner)
3. Click `Experimental Features`
4. Enable `Developer Mode`
5. Install the [Helium-Solana Ledger App](https://github.com/helium/app-helium-solana) as you
   normally would.
6. Close Ledger Live

---

### Migrating

The following utility will migrate all tokens from the Helium derivation path `44'/904'/n'/0'` to
the Solana derivation path `44'/501'/n'/0'`.

Ledger users will need to update their Helium Ledger App to a version that's pending release. This
upcoming version will use the Solana private key derivation path that moves all your tokens and
balances over to Solana. You may need to uninstall any Solana Ledger Apps during the Wallet
migration process.

---

### Migration Tool

Your public key will change on Solana, but the private key will remain the same. Note this app only
works with Chrome, Brave, or other Chromium-based web browsers.

- [Helium-Solana Ledger App](https://github.com/helium/app-helium-solana) now available from Ledger
  Live (ensure Developer Mode is enabled)
- [Solana Ledger App](https://support.ledger.com/article/360016265659-zd) using Ledger Live

:::note Close Ledger Live

**Before starting these steps, close the Ledger Live application or the transactions will fail.**

import { LedgerMigration } from '@theme/LedgerMigration'

### Derivation Paths and your new Public Key

The Helium Ledger App uses `ED25519` keys, similarly to Solana, but at a different derivation path.

This means that, while seed phrases are the same, private keys are different on Solana.

In order to get around this, when you run the migration, the migration application will ask you to
use the old derivation path to approve sending all of your Hotspots, tokens, etc. to the new
derivation path.
