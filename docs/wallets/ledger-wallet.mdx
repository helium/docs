# Ledger Hardware Wallet

The Helium tokens have support for Ledger Hardware Wallets via the Solana blockchain. Ledger allows
for:

- Viewing account address(es) and balances
- Transferring tokens
- Signing transactions

At this time, Hotspot management actions such as onboarding or asserting location are not supported.
You will need to perform these actions within the [Helium Wallet App.](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/helium-wallet-app)

Helium HNT, MOBILE and IOT are Solana SPL tokens and are supported by the Solana App for Ledger but 
not directly in Ledger Live.

Installation instructons for the Solana App are on [Ledger Solana support page.](https://support.ledger.com/article/360016265659-zd) 
Remember to configure [blind signing.](https://support.ledger.com/article/4499092909085-zd)

The recommendation is to use Solflare or Phantom to [access SOL/SPL tokens with Ledger.](https://support.ledger.com/article/7723954701469-zd)

Solflare, Phantom and other non-custodial wallets can import the private key from the Helium Wallet App.
Follow the instructions on our using [Third Party Wallets](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/third-party-wallets#importing-helium-accounts-into-solana-wallets) documentation.
