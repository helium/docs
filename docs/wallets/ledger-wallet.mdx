# Ledger Hardware Wallet

The Helium tokens have support for Ledger Hardware Wallets via the Solana blockchain. Ledger allows
for:

- Viewing account address(es) and balances
- Transferring tokens
- Signing transactions

At this time, Hotspot management actions such as onboarding or asserting location are not supported.
You will need to perform these actions within the
[Helium Wallet App.](https://docs.helium.com/wallets/helium-wallet-app)

Helium HNT, MOBILE and IOT are Solana SPL tokens and are supported by the Solana App for Ledger but
not directly in Ledger Live.

Installation instructions for the Solana App are on
[Ledger Solana support page.](https://support.ledger.com/article/360016265659-zd) Remember to
configure [blind signing.](https://support.ledger.com/article/4499092909085-zd)

## Testing your Ledger Cold Wallet

Before making any significant transfers into your new Ledger wallet, it is best to make a series of
test transfers in and out of your wallet.

1. Open the Helium Black Wallet App on your smartphone
2. Navigate to your Ledger Wallet from steps above
3. Copy the pub key of your Ledger Wallet
4. Make a test transfer of SOL into your new Ledger Wallet  
   :::tip

   Transfers out of your wallet will require SOL to pay fees, so start by adding at little SOL e.g.
   0.1 SOL to your wallet.

   :::

5. Copy the pub key of an external wallet (either Coinbase or other Black Wallet App native wallet)
6. Make a test transfer of SOL out of your new Ledger Wallet  
   :::note

   This will require your Ledger to be PIN unlocked and Solana App started and "ready" to complete

   :::

7. Review and Approve the transaction on your Ledger Device when prompted
8. Repeat the Process with HNT or IOT again with small amounts
9. After your have tested transfers in and out of your Ledger wallet, you are ready for safe cold
   storage using your Ledger Wallet.
