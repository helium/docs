# Ledger Hardware Wallet

The Helium blockchain has support for Ledger hardware wallets. When installed on
a Nano S or Nano X, the Helium ledger app allows you to:

- view your Helium address(es) and balances
- issue a payment to one address
- submit validator transactions, including stake, transfer, and unstake

This guide will walk through using Helium on a Ledger Nano S but is similar to
setup on the Nano X.

:::info
As of version 2.1.1, the Helium Ledger application is currently PENDING REVIEW
by the Ledger team. The application is scheduled for security review and we
hope to hear about the results by end of Q3 2021.
:::

## Installing the Helium ledger application

- Go to Ledger Live &gt; Settings &gt; Experimental Features &gt; Enable
Developer mode.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wallets/ledger/ledger-dev-mode.png")} />

- Once enabled, go to Manager and search "Helium".

:::info
If you can't find "Helium", you may need to update your Ledger Live.
:::

- Click Install.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wallets/ledger/ledger-installed.png")} />

The Helium App has been signed by Ledger and is trusted. It is now installed on
your Ledger device!

Start the Helium app by selecting it on the Ledger screen. The "Waiting for
commands..." prompt should be on the screen.

## Execute Commands

:::info
Make sure Ledger Live is closed before proceeding! The companion app
cannot run when Ledger Live is blocking the USB device.
:::

To interact with the app on Ledger, you will need to use the CLI. Head to
[Releases in the Github repo](https://github.com/helium/helium-ledger-cli/releases)
and download the most recent release for your operating system.

We'll use macOS for the remainder of this example.

- Download the release for macOS
`helium-ledger-cli-x.x.x-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip` and unzip the file
- Navigate to where you downloaded the release on your computer in terminal
- Make sure your ledger is connected to your computer, then type
`./helium-ledger-cli`

```bash
~/helium-ledger-cli-v2.0.0-x86-64-macos$ ./helium-ledger-cli
Communicating with Ledger - follow prompts on screen
helium-ledger-cli 2.0.0
Interact with Ledger Nano S for hardware wallet management

USAGE:
    helium-ledger-cli [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --account <account>      Select account index to stake from [default: 0]
        --emulator <emulator>    Enable interaction with emulator for development and testing by configuring port for
                                 TCP connection here (typically 9999 or 40000)

SUBCOMMANDS:
    balance      Get wallet information
    help         Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    pay          Pay a given address
    validator    Stake a validator
```

## Check Balance and Receive HNT

Type `./helium-ledger-cli balance` to see your new Ledger address and balance.

```bash
~/helium-ledger-cli-v2.0.0-x86-64-macos$ ./helium-ledger-cli balance
Communicating with Ledger - follow prompts on screen
Ledger running Helium App v2.1.0

+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Address                                             | Balance HNT | Data Credits | Security Tokens |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
| ACCOUNT_0_REDACTED                                  | 0.00000000  | 0            | 0.00000000      |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
```

:::warning
Do not simply rely on what you see on the CLI, but verify it matches
what is displayed on the Ledger.
:::

:::info
You may use add `--qr` option to the command to display your address in
the form of QR code.
:::

To receive HNT, simply provide your address in the base58 format output from the
CLI or by using the QR code.

## Multiple Wallet Support

Your Ledger hardware wallet can actually support many accounts per supported
coin and this is no different for HNT. To interact with a wallet other than the
default 0th account, you place a `--account N` flag before the command. So the
balance command becomes: `helium-ledger-cli --account 1 balance`

```bash
~/helium-ledger-cli-v2.0.0-x86-64-macos$ ./helium-ledger-cli --account 1 balance
Communicating with Ledger - follow prompts on screen
Ledger running Helium App v2.1.0

+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Address                                             | Balance HNT | Data Credits | Security Tokens |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
| ACCOUNT_1_REDACTED                                  | 0.00000000  | 0            | 0.00000000      |
+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
```

This `--account N` prefix applies to all commands. The balance command has a
special flag, `--scan` that you can place _after_ the command. This allows you
to scan all the wallets from 0 to N. For example:
`helium-ledger-cli --account 8 balance --scan`

```bash
~/helium-ledger-cli-v2.0.0-x86-64-macos$ ./helium-ledger-cli --account 8 balance --scan

```

:::info
Up to 255 wallets may be used on the Ledger, but the `--scan` command
fetches each address one-by-one; it will take quite a long time to get all 255
addresses.

While this convenience feature exists, **double check the address using the
screen of the Ledger** (ie: call the specific `--account N balance` without the
`--scan` option) before sending any assets. A nefarious CLI application could
provide fake addresses.
:::

## Supported Transactions

We will document an example `pay` transactions here, but the documents may lag
changes in the app. It's good to get familiar with the built-in documentation of
the CLI. At the top-level, you can do `./helium-ledger-cli --help` to get an
understanding of what transactions might be available.

At time of writing, you'll see the following "subcommands" are available:

- **balance**: get wallet information
- **pay**: pay a given address
- **validator**: stake a validator

To understand how to use a particular command, simply call the command with the
addition of the `--help` flag. For example: `./helium-ledger-cli --help`

```bash
~/helium-ledger-cli-v2.0.0-x86-64-macos$ ./helium-ledger-cli pay --help
Communicating with Ledger - follow prompts on screen
helium-ledger-cli-pay 2.0.0
Pay a given address

USAGE:
    helium-ledger-cli pay [OPTIONS] <address> <amount>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --fee <fee>        Manually set the DC fee to pay for the transaction
        --nonce <nonce>    Manually set the nonce for the transaction

ARGS:
    <address>    Address to send the tokens to
    <amount>     Amount of HNT to send
```

The `USAGE` example shows you what the command should look like and the `ARGS`
are documented at the bottom. Always refer to the built-in help menu over these
docs.

Even if you rely on the `--help` menu from here on out, the `pay` command in
this guide will be good practice for using the Ledger and making sure you
understand the security model.

## Sending HNT

1. On the CLI, type `./helium-ledger-cli pay <address> <amount>` to pay in HNT.
Press `return`.
2. On the Ledger, follow the prompts and confirm the transaction.
3. The CLI should show a confirmation of the transaction.

```bash
$ ./helium-ledger-cli pay PAYEE_ACCOUNT 0.1
Communicating with Ledger - follow prompts on screen
Ledger running Helium App v2.1.0

Creating the following transaction:
+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------+--------+
| Payee                                               | Pay Amount HNT | Nonce | DC Fee |
+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------+--------+
| PAYEE_ACCOUNT                                       | 0.10000000     | 6     | 35000  |
+-----------------------------------------------------+----------------+-------+--------+
WARNING: do not use this output as the source of truth. Instead, rely on the Ledger Display
```

:::warning
Use the screen of the Ledger to confirm everything you do. The CLI
app could be nefarious (maybe you downloaded the wrong one, maybe somebody
change the program on your computer, etc). The Ledger on the other hand will
only load applications signed by Ledger, so your security relies on you
verifying the transaction details on the screen.

To be clear, do not compare the output to the output from the CLI shown above
(the nefarious app might be showing you the fake address), but instead from your
original source.
:::

Verify the parameters of the transcation on the screen. Addresses are long and
need to be scrolled (hold the right or left button only). Once you are satisfied
with the field, click both buttons to confirm:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wallets/ledger/click_ledger.jpg")} />

Once you click the "Sign Transaction?" confirmation, the transaction will be
signed by the Ledger and submitted to the blockchain by the CLI application:

```bash
Successfully submitted transaction to API:
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| Network | Hash                                        |
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| mainnet | HASH                                        |
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
To check on transaction status, monitor the following URL:
     https://api.helium.io/v1/pending_transactions/HASH
```

Use the link displayed to check on your transaction status.

## Common Issues

### Can't download the zip file because it is untrusted.

1. In the downloads bar of your browser, click the caret and select `Keep`.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wallets/ledger/macos-zip-warning2.png")} />

### Running commands in terminal does not work. MacOS users may need to update their security permissions.

1. Go to System Preferences &gt; Security & Privacy
2. Allow App downloaded from App Store and Identified Developers
3. You may need to click the lock icon and give the CLI permissions
4. Run the command in CLI again

### Failed opening hid device

If you see this error `error: hid error: Failed opening hid device`, close
Ledger Live software and run a command again in the CLI.

### Unable to access memory outside buffer bounds

If on Ledger Live you see this error, unplug the ledger from your computer and
plug it in again.

## Security Model

The attack surface for using the Helium wallet app on a Ledger comprises
the Helium app itself, the system firmware running on the Ledger Hardware Wallet,
the computer that the Ledger Hardware Wallet is connected to, and possession/control
of the device. For our purposes, the app only needs to ensure its own correctness
and protect the user from the computer that the Ledger Hardware Wallet is connected
to. Other attack surfaces are beyond our control; we assume that the user physically
controls the device, is not running malicious/buggy software on the device, and
follows proper security protocols. The goal of the Helium app is to achieve security
given these assumptions.

The main attack vector that we are concerned with, then, is a computer running
malicious software. This software may imitate programs like `helium-ledger-cli`
in such a way that the user cannot tell the difference, but secretly act
maliciously. Specifically, the computer can do the following:

1. Lie to the user about which actions it is performing.

Example: the user runs `./helium-ledger-cli balance` to display their public
key to so that they may receive payment; yet a hard-coded address is
displayed

2. Lie to the user about who the recipient is.

Example: the user runs `./helium-ledger-cli pay IntendedAddress amount`, yet
the program again uses a hard-coded address

To combat these attacks, the app makes use of the embedded display on the Nano
S. Data sent to/from the Ledger Hardware Wallet is displayed on the screen so
the user can verify that the computer is not lying about what it sent or received.
In the interest of user-friendliness, we would like to display as little information
as much as possible, but each omission brings with it the risk of introducing a
vulnerability. Therefore, the app displays all data by default, and omits data
only after subjecting the omission to extreme scrutiny.
