# Twelve Word Seed Phrase

When creating a Helium wallet through the Helium Hotspot app, you were prompted to write down the
12-word seed phrase. These are the mnemonic phrase generated from the private key of your wallet and
the only way to access the wallet. 
The Helium Hotspot App is now no longer used for creating or managing wallets.

The 12-word seed phrase can be imported in the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). 
You can still see the previously created 12-word phrase in the Helium Hotspot app. 
Select > Settings Icon > Reveal Words.

:::warning

The 12-words can never be recovered if they are lost, and they are the sole key to accessing your
wallet, the HNT it contains, and all access to your Hotspot and its rewards. Lose the 12-words, lose
it all. You are not able to log into your account without them, nor can you transfer HNT or a
Hotspot to a different account without them.

## Twelve Word Security

A friendly reminder about those 12 wordsâ€¦ When you first created an account in the Helium Hotspot
App, those 12 words represent the private key to your wallet account.

### What Does This Mean?

It means that those 12 words are the only way to access your Hotspots and HNT balance. Lose those 12
words and you lose your access to your HNT and your Hotspots and their future earnings. No one can
help you recover them.

Luckily, there is an easy way to back up those 12 words. Write them down, save them, and back them
up. Go to the Helium Hotspot App You can still see the previously created 12-word phrase in the Helium 
Hotspot app. Select > Settings Icon > Reveal Words.

:::note

No Helium Support or Admin person will EVER ask for your 12 or 24 words or ask you to enter them into
a website to fix a problem.

:::note

Remember these important things.

1. Write them down and keep them safe, do it now if you are not sure.
2. Imagine they are cash, never give them to anyone you would not trust with the HNT value and
   Hotspot value.
3. Do not enter these in any app or website not on the list above. This includes vendor apps.
4. Do not store images of your words on cloud-based doc/file stores.
