# Helium Wallet Seed Phrase

When creating a Helium Wallet, users are prompted to write down the 24-word seed phrase. These are
the mnemonic phrases generated from the private key of the Wallet and the only way to access the
Wallet.

:::info Hotspot App Users must migrate to the Helium Wallet app.

Long term Helium Hotspot app users may have a 12-word seed phrase, which can be used in place of a
24-word seed phrase. All new Helium Wallets are generated from a 24-word seed phrase.

The Helium Hotspot app is now no longer used for creating or managing Wallets.

You can still see the previously created 12-word phrase in the Helium Hotspot app. Select > Settings
Icon > Reveal Words.

The 12-word seed phrase can be imported in the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

## Seed Phrase Security

:::warning Lose the seed phrase, lose it all.

The seed phrase words can never be recovered if they are lost, and they are the sole key to
accessing a Wallet, the tokens and NFTs it contains, and all access to associated Hotspots and their
rewards.

:::

Back up a seed phrase by writing down the words on paper with a pen and appropriately secure them.

No one can recover a lost, forgotten, or misplaced seed phrase.

Existing Helium Wallet and Helium Hotspot app users can view the seed phrase for a Wallet in the app
settings menu under `Reveal Words`.

:::caution Before Deleting Helium Wallet Apps

Do not uninstall or log out of the Helium Wallet app without first writing down the seed phrase.

:::

The only places you were ever required to enter your seed phrase are:

1. The [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) - on your phone
2. The [CLI Wallet](/wallets/cli-wallet) - on your computer - this is being discontinued
3. The [Ledger Wallet](/wallets/ledger) - on your computer or phone **NEVER enter them into a
   website.**

When entering the seed phrase make sure you:

1. Enter them in the right order
2. Get the spelling correct. Check words here for correct spelling:

No Helium Support or Admin person will EVER ask for your seed phrase words or ask you to enter them
into a website to fix a problem.

:::note Remember these important things.

1. Write down and keep seed phrases safe, do it now.
2. Never give seed phrase words to anyone who can not be trusted with the HNT value and Hotspot
   value.
3. Do not enter seed phrase words in any app or website not on the list above.
4. Do not enter seed phrase words in any Maker App.
5. Do not store images of your words on cloud-based doc/file stores.

## Solana Seed Phrases

Seed phrases generated to create Wallets on the Helium blockchain can not be used on the Solana
blockchain. To migrate a Helium Wallet to a Solana Wallet you must export and import the private key
from a Helium Wallet to a Solana Wallet.
