# Helium Wallet Seed Phrase

When creating a Helium account, users are prompted to write down the 24-word seed phrase. This
mnemonic phrase is generated from a list of 2048 specifically selected words and can be used to
recover the private key of the account. The seed phrase should never be shared.

## Seed Phrase Security

:::caution Lose the seed phrase, lose it all.

The seed phrase words can never be recovered if they are lost. They are the sole key to accessing an
account, the tokens and NFTs it contains, and all access to associated Hotspots and their rewards.

:::

:::note Remember these important things.

1. Write down and keep seed phrases safe, do it now.
2. Never give seed phrase words to anyone who cannot be trusted with full control of your Hotspots
   and token balances.
3. Do not enter seed phrase words in any app or website you don't fully trust.

:::

Back up a seed phrase by writing down the words in their exact order and appropriately securing
them. As an even more robust solution, some experienced crypto users engrave their seed phrases on
[titanium plates](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=titanium+seed+phrase+plate&sprefix=titanium+seed%2Caps%2C159).

Storing seed phrases on cloud storage providers like Google Drive or Dropbox is not recommended.
When these services are compromised, seed phrases are among the first things that hackers look for.

No one can recover a lost, forgotten, or misplaced seed phrase.

When entering the seed phrase make sure you:

1. Enter them in the right order.
2. Get the spelling correct. Check words here for correct spelling:

## 12 vs 24-Word Seed Phrases

While seed phrases can come in a few different lengths, 12 and 24-word will be most familiar for
Helium users. Most early accounts leverage a 12-word seed phrase. Accounts created with the
[Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) are generated with 24-word seed phrases. The Helium
Wallet app supports both formats.

With 128 bits of entropy, a 12-word seed phrase has 3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup> possible combinations. A
24-word seed phrase has 256 bits of entropy, resulting in approximately 1.16 × 10<sup>77</sup>
possible combinations. Both are _highly_ secure, but 24-word phrases offer the best protection.
