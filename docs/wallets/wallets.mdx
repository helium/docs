## Wallet Migration Guide

All Helium Wallets will need to be migrated to the Solana blockchain. Please refer to the
[Wallet migration guide](/solana/migration/wallet-user) about the different Wallets and what can be
expected as part of the blockchain migration.

## 12-Word And 24-Word Seed Phrases

When a Helium Wallet is created with the Helium Wallet app a 24-word "Seed Phrase" is generated.

Users who created their Helium Wallet using the Helium Hotspot app will have a 12-word seed phrase,
while the Helium Wallet app accepts 12-word seed phrases, all new Helium Wallets are created with
24-word seed phrases.

Read more about Helium Wallet [seed phrases here](/wallet-seed-phrase).

:::note

Transferring Hotspot ownership between 12-word and 24-word Wallets can only be done using the
[Wallet CLI](/cli-wallet)
