# Helium Wallets

In blockchain projects, various wallet applications exist to help users manage their own private
keys, enabling them to sign transactions and transfer assets.

For the Helium Network, a wallet maintains ownership of Hotspots themselves, the Helium Network
Tokens (HNT), and/or Data Credits (DC).

Depending on your situation, one of the wallets here may be the best fit.

## Helium Wallet App

In February 2022, the Helium Core Team announced the future of Helium Apps - splitting the existing
[Helium Hotspot app](/wallets/app-wallet) into its two functional components; managing Hotspots and
managing Tokens.

The Helium Wallet App is a single App to manage your Tokens and identity on the Helium Network!

Some notable features:

- Multiple Account Support
- Ledger Balance
- Address Book
- Verify your Helium Identity
- Helium Vote
- Multiple Recipient Payment Support

## Command Line Interface Wallet

The Helium Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet is the most flexible but it also requires more
technical knowledge. As such, it is suitable for all types of transactions, but requires more
caution on behalf of its users.

Learn more about usage [here](/wallets/cli-wallet). Source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs).

## Ledger Wallet

The Helium Ledger Wallet is an application that runs on the Ledger Hardware wallet. The Ledger
Hardware wallet is the most secure way to send and receive the Helium Network Token (HNT), but
currently supports no other transactions.

Learn more about usage [here](/wallets/ledger). Source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/helium/helium-ledger-cli).

## Helium Hotspot App

:::important Sunsetting Features

Wallet-related functionality in the Helium Hotspot app will be sunsetted over the coming months.

## 12-Word and 24-Word Seed Phrases

When a Helium Wallet is created with the Helium Wallet App or Helium Hotspot App, a 12-word or
24-word "Seed Phrase" is generated.

Users who created their Helium Wallet using the Helium Hotspot App will have a 12-word seed phrase,
while the Helium Wallet App accepts 12-word seed phrases, all new wallets are created with 24-word
seed phrases.

Read more about Helium 12-word and 24-word here:

- [12-Word Seed Phrase](/wallets/twelve-words)
- [24-Word Seed Phrase](/wallets/twenty-four-words)

:::note

Transferring Hotspot ownership between 12-word and 24-word wallets can only be done using the
[Wallet CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet)
