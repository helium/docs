## Helium Is Moving To Solana

As part of the Helium blockchain migration to Solana, there are some changes to existing Helium
Wallets and applications for users to be aware of.

The Helium Network move to the Solana blockchain will result in all Hotspots automatically becoming
[Solana NFTs](https://solana.com/developers/nfts) which, along with the Helium tokens, can be viewed
in the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

The original Helium app [will be stripped of functionality](/wallets#sunsetting-the-helium-app) in
phases, with transactions being moved to the Helium Wallet app and Hotspot maintenance moving to
[Maker apps](/mine-hnt/maker-apps).

The sections below provide more information about the different Wallets and what can be expected as
part of the blockchain migration.

## Hotspots on Solana

- Hotspots will move to the new Solana blockchain, specifically performing off-chain
  Proof-of-Coverage. More information on off-chain PoC can be found in
  [HIP-70](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md#implementing-proof-of-coverage-oracles).
- Makers will push a fleet-wide update to all their Hotspots that switches a Hotspot from receiving
  Challenges from Validators to automatically beaconing by themselves every 6 hours and sending
  results to an Off-Chain Oracle.
- Makers must push this mandatory update to their fleet of Hotspots. Failure to do so will mean
  their customers cease to mine and stop earning rewards once the blockchain migration is complete.

### Hotspots Will Earn IOT

Hotspot Owners will start earning IOT as the blockchain migration will launch the IOT subDAO. To
view IOT earned by your Hotspot, use the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). 5G Hotspot
Owners will continue earning MOBILE and will additionally begin to earn IOT.

:::note 5G Hotspot Owners

Your 5G Hotspot will become an NFT, and your CBRS Radios will remain with a serial number, just like
before the Solana transition.

:::

### Hotspots Become NFTs

Wallet migration is required to view your Hotspot as NFT in the
[Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

## Sunsetting the Helium App

> Some users may know the [Helium app](/wallets/app-wallet) as the "Helium Hotspot App" or "the blue
> app."

The existing [Helium Hotspot app](/wallets/app-wallet) will be restricted to only management of
Original Helium Hotspots in two phases.

**Phase 1:**

> ETA December 19, 2022

- Hotspot App users will be migrated to use the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) for
  Helium Wallet management.
- Users can no longer onboard new Hotspots using the Helium App. All new Hotspots will be directed
  to use the Hotspot's Maker app, web dashboard, or contact email support (in the event that a Maker
  app is not available).

:::info Maker app Availability

All Makers had a deadline to launch their Maker app by March of 2022. Makers without an app or web
dashboard either have an app in development or have not responded to requests for additional
updates.

:::

- Hotspot management for _existing_ Hotspots still available in the Hotspot App.
- The `transfer_hotspot` and `assert_location` will use the Helium Wallet app for signatures.

**Phase 2:**

> ETA January 2023

- Hotspot management will be handled by Maker apps.
- Original Helium Hotspots will be managed by the Helium App.
- All remaining Wallet functionality will use the Helium Wallet app.

:::note What If I Miss The Wallet Migration Deadline?

Users that do not transition to the Helium Wallet app prior to the Solana blockchain migration will
still be able to access their seed phrase and transition to the Helium Wallet app but will not be
able to submit transactions in the Helium app. Seed phrase export functionality will remain in the
app for at least 1 year post blockchain migration.

:::

### Maker Apps

Makers will need to update their [Maker Apps](/mine-hnt/maker-apps#known-maker-apps) to use the new
Solana transaction type to add Hotspots to the network, assert location, and transfer Hotspots.

The core team will make this update available to Makers in an SDK update weeks before the chain halt
to allow Makers time to make the update, release the app to the app store, and available to Hotspot
owners.

The minimum app version will change with each Maker - please check with them for exact details.

:::note Maker Updates

Note that Makers that do not update their Maker apps will mean their customers will not be able to
add new Hotspots to the network, transfer existing Hotspots, or assert locations.

## Wallet Migration Guides

All Helium Wallets will need to be migrated to the Solana blockchain. What this means for each
Helium Wallet type is explained below.

### For Helium App Users

The [Helium app](/wallets/app-wallet) will require a migration to the
[Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app). Wallet migration is necessary to interact with your
HNT, DC, MOBILE, IOT, and Hotspots on the Solana blockchain.

To start, ensure your [Helium app](/wallets/app-wallet) is updated and that you have downloaded the
latest Helium Wallet app.

1. Open the [Helium app](/wallets/app-wallet) (minimum v4.3.0)
2. Tap `Start Migration` in the Wallet migration popup
3. Confirm the Wallet account you want to import, then tap `Export to Wallet App`. The
   [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) will automatically open and complete the Wallet
   migration.
4. Now your HNT, DC, MOBILE, and Hotspots have successfully moved to the Helium Wallet App and ready
   for the Solana migration, which will happen automatically in January 2023.

You will use the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) moving forward. You can find
Hotspot NFTs in the NFT Collectibles section once Helium on Solana goes live. Token balances are
visible on the account page. You can also create multiple accounts in the
[Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

Your public Wallet address will change post-migration, but your private key and 12-word seed phrase
will remain the same.

### For Helium Wallet App Users

> Some users may know the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) as the "New Wallet app" or
> "the black app."

To migrate to Solana, simply update your [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) version to
2.0.0 or newer. Thatâ€™s it!

If you have Hotspots in any account, they will appear as an NFT Collectable. All other tokens and
their balances are automatically transferred to the Solana Blockchain under the same token name.

Your public Wallet address will change, but your private key and seed phrase (12 or 24 word) will
remain the same.

### For Ledger Wallet Users

Ledger users will need to update their Helium Ledger App to a version that's pending release. This
upcoming version will use the Solana private key derivation path that moves all your tokens and
balances over to Solana. You may need to uninstall any Solana Ledger Apps during the Wallet
migration process.

Your public key will change on Solana and the private key will also need to be updated.

### For CLI Wallet Users

:::caution The Helium CLI Wallet Will Be Depreciated

The CLI Wallet will be completely deprecated except for exporting private seed phrases and
displaying public Solana addresses.

Check out the [Solana Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli) for more information
on Solana Command Line Wallets.

:::

The CLI Wallet will have its feature set pared down as there are many other Solana-compatible CLI
Wallets. The existing Helium CLI Wallet will be reduced to the following two functions:

1. Export Seed Phrase to import into a Solana CLI Wallet (or the
   [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app))
2. Display Solana Public Address (for a given set of private keys)

This means common payment transactions and staking should utilize
[Solana CLI Wallet](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/cli) or the
[Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

## 12-Word And 24-Word Seed Phrases

When a Helium Wallet is created with the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) or Helium
Hotspot App, a 12-word or 24-word "Seed Phrase" is generated.

Users who created their Helium Wallet using the Helium Hotspot App will have a 12-word seed phrase,
while the [Helium Wallet app](/wallets/helium-wallet-app) accepts 12-word seed phrases, all new
wallets are created with 24-word seed phrases.

Read more about Helium 12-word and 24-word here:

- [12-Word Seed Phrase](/wallets/twelve-words)
- [24-Word Seed Phrase](/wallets/twenty-four-words)

:::note

Transferring Hotspot ownership between 12-word and 24-word Wallets can only be done using the
[Wallet CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet)
