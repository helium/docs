As a blockchain-powered network, Helium uses on-chain
[accounts](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts) to protect Hotspots and
Tokens. An account is an abstraction for a cryptographic key which consists of two parts — a public
key and a private key. This approach of having two keys is known as
[public key cryptography](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/how-does-blockchain-use-public-key-cryptography)
which is a widely used cryptographic system in blockchains. Users new to web3 are likely accustomed
to usernames and passwords as authentication methods. Web3 projects such as Helium replace
traditional logins with private and public keys.

## Diving into Crypto Wallets

A crypto wallet operates as a custodian for the public and private cryptographic keys. Wallets
enable users to transmit, obtain, and oversee cryptocurrency ownership. These wallets can be as
varied as directories on a computer, physical paper codes, or exclusive hardware devices. A host of
apps and software solutions also present a streamlined process for wallet creation and maintenance.

The Helium Foundation maintains the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app), which is
specifically catered to the needs of the Helium Network. However, as a Solana-native token, Helium
is accessible through any Solana-enabled wallet.

## Understanding Public and Private Keys

As the names imply, there is a distinction between the different keys that are generated when
creating a new Helium account, or any other web3 account for that matter. The distinction between
these keys is important to understand.

### Public Key

The public key is your 'calling card' on the blockchain. Anyone with it can view token balances,
Hotspots, and any associated history of these entities. The public key is the address that can be
shared.

For purposes of security, the public key cannot be used to determine the private key.

For Helium and other projects on Solana, public keys are strings of letters and numbers that look
like `dcuc8Amr83Wz27ZkQ2K9NS6r8zRpf1J6cvArEBDZDmm`. Strings beginning with `11`, `13`, or `14` are
likely to be keys on the old Helium blockchain. Double-check these addresses using the
[conversion tool at the bottom of this page](#legacy-l1-conversion).

### Private Key

The private key of your account is never to be shared and should be kept safe from potential
thieves. If a private key is lost, there is no means of recovering it. If the _public_ key is lost
or forgotten, the private key can be used to determine it using the derivation path leveraged by
Helium Wallet App accounts.

Private keys can take several forms, though most will know them as
[12-word or 24-word seed phrases](/wallets/wallet-seed-phrase). Certain tools can also manage
private key phrases stored in a file; something like `keyfile.bin` or as a long string of letters
and numbers.

Private keys allow for full access to an account's contents and should be protected. These keys are
never needed to diagnose a Hotspot or verify on-chain transactions.

:::warning Important summary: Never give away your seed phrases or private keys

Avoid entering or sending private keys to any untrusted websites or applications.  
Helium does not require these details for any reason, including support, airdrop, or redemption.

## Wallet Migration

If you have not accessed your wallet since the blockchain migration to Solana on April 18, 2023,
please refer to the [Wallet User Migration Guide](/solana/migration/wallet-user).

To learn about moving your account from the Helium Wallet App to another Solana-compatible wallet,
see the guide in [Third-Party Wallets](/wallets/third-party-wallets).

### Legacy Helium Addresses {#legacy-l1-conversion}

This tool displays the equivalent public addresses between the legacy Helium blockchain and the
current Solana accounts. Legacy account addresses should not be used when sending transactions
between accounts or from exchanges.
