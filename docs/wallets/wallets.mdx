:::warning Sunsetting Features

## Sunsetting the Helium App

Some users may know "the Helium app" as the "Helium Hotspot App" or "the blue app."

The original Helium app will be stripped of functionality in phases, with transactions being moved
to the Helium Wallet app and Hotspot maintenance moving to [Maker apps](/hotspot-makers/maker-apps).

The existing Helium Hotspot app will be restricted to only the management of Original Helium
Hotspots. Read more about this upcomging change on the
[Helium Hotspot App (is Being Deprecated)](/mine-hnt/helium-hotspot-app) page.

## Wallet Migration Guide

All Helium Wallets will need to be migrated to the Solana blockchain. Please refer to the
[wallet migration guide](/solana/migration/wallet-user) about the different Wallets and what can be
expected as part of the blockchain migration.

## 12-Word And 24-Word Seed Phrases

When a Helium Wallet is created with the Helium Wallet app or Helium Hotspot App, a 12-word or
24-word "Seed Phrase" is generated.

Users who created their Helium Wallet using the Helium Hotspot App will have a 12-word seed phrase,
while the Helium Wallet app accepts 12-word seed phrases, all new wallets are created with 24-word
seed phrases.

Read more about Helium 12-word and 24-word here:

- [12-Word Seed Phrase](/wallets/twelve-words)
- [24-Word Seed Phrase](/wallets/twenty-four-words)

:::note

Transferring Hotspot ownership between 12-word and 24-word Wallets can only be done using the
[Wallet CLI](/wallets/cli-wallet)
